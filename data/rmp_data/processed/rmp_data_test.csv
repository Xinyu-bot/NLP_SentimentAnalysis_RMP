this teacher is so disorganized. He was always all over the place for every lecture. Obviously smart and guy and has hundreds of students but dude needs to get his ish together,0
"A real stickler when it comes to attendance and grading and doesn't forgive mistakes at all (won't even reply to emails for explanations). I accidentally turned in a wrong paper and even though he knew, didn't mention anything until giving back my grade and wouldn't accept my actual paper. Jerk. Take this class with a different professor.",0
"Halfway in the semester and all I've learned is basically the psychological effects of breast feeding. Your points come from attendance and tests, which he does provide a study guide for. If you are willing to sit through the lectures and study then go ahead. If not, find another class.",0
"doesn't just teach you facts, teaches you how to think, challenges you as a student. The best teacher at Coventry. Should be a Prof!",1
"Lady expects us to write a 15 page law school policy brief in 2 days. We would have had more time to think about it and write it, if not for her disorganized teaching style and procrastination! She procrastinates so much and never keeps to her promise. Its really hard to keep up with the class because of her.",0
I am currently taking him for Corporate Finance. He keeps the class interesting and tries to teach you real life situations instead of just learning from the textbook. Good Professor in my opinion.,1
"Only two tests, first is take home and second is in class final but gives study guide.  Three books required and weekly reaction papers due from the assigned readings. Other than a lot of reading, course is easy. ",1
Her class is pretty straight forward. Only 3 essays and. Final presentation. You have journals in class everyday and have to write a couple paragraphs online every Wednesday but it's all easy. As long as you come to class and do the work you will pass. The class is fairly easy.,1
This is an online course.  The semester is over and there are still unanswered e-mails that need a response. Not a good communicator at all.,0
"Participate and do the homework. This is a language class, and Sensei Garrissi expects you to speak the language in the class.",1
Professor Yue is the most dedicated professors to a course that I have ever been taught by in my four years at RPI. She provides excellent feedback and teaches the material excellently. Class time is very productive and stimulating. She also provides opportunities for students to practice the language outside of the classroom with native speakers.,1
"As an English teacher, her English really sucks.",0
Amazing chemistry professor. He didn't slack when it came to teaching. He made sure to get through all the course content as best as he could with you still understanding it. Plus I had this lab instructor who was a tough grader and McPherson was always willing to critique my lab reports before I submitted them & I always got an A on those reports.,1
"This is not an easy subject but Professor McClay makes the lectures easy to listen to. She gives ""pop"" quizzes in the beginning of class. If you are not on time then you will miss it. Lab time is when you can ask all the questions you have. She is very personable and willing to help. Just ask. Really enjoyed this class.",1
"Fairly simple class, not a lot of time outside of class besides reading a ton of children's lit which I found to be the most useful assignment that I've had in the college of education. You have a 100% choice of what you read, also! Some busy work, but it's the same in all of the sections.",1
"She is great!! There is alot of reading in this class, but if you go to class you will get at least a B or an A on the test with out ever reading the book. She offers alot of extra credit pts. It was a great class, lots of fun, and very intresting. Pretty easy class!",1
"Dr. Searfoss thinks she is the only one that is right. I never want to talk in this class because she never accepts anyone's answers, even though everyone is just giving their analysis of a reading. I am not sure why she even wants the class to participate when no one is right but her. I would not recommend her if you want to feel respected.",0
"Barely showed up for this class & passed with an A grade. You can skip his lectures, but DO NOT SKIP review day! He gives his EXACT exam questions so be sure to write it all down & print it on his allowed 1-page cheat sheet. He doesn't check his homework so I just passed HW1 for all the homeworks and changed the name to HW2, HW3, so on. Easy A",0
"I can actually speak Japanese now. Professor Garrisi emphasizes that students speak in Japanese everyday in class. Be prepared to be called on several timers per class, and reply in Japanese. I loved this. She was amazing and funny!",1
Never again he doesnt teach us anything at all your book is your best friend. #facts,0
You gotta WORK for your grade in this class 3 midterms and a final. Prof has at least 1 essay per test and final is cumulative. Difficult class but if u do the work u can pass,1
"Laura is nice and very young. Had no control of the class, it was very difficult to listen to class instruction. She offered no make up tests or assistance with progress or lack there of! She said most of the class was not passing, yet did nothing to control the class noise for those who need to pass or help them achieve that! Doomed for failure!",0
"Mrs. Mattox is a really nice lady who has loads of experience in the subject she teaches. It can sometimes feel like a high school class but that's what she's used to teach. She does ""reviews"" for the test that are usually all of the test questions so if you memorize those, the class is a super easy A. SOOO many group projects.",1
"If your not good with computers, I'd advice choosing another professor. Moved through material fast, assumes you know the basics, and spends most of the time cracking jokes (not that I'm opposed to jokes, just that I need a teacher not a comedian.) chi test are easy but had a hard time with the in-class computer exams, especially with being timed. ",0
This clas was super fun. I was so afraid to speak in public speaking but prof Chalakani-baier made me feel so comfortable. I would def take her class again.,1
Davidovitch is an absolutely useless incomprehensible teacher with no ability to help his students with anything.  THe way he teaches is impossible to learn from without memorizing every single thing he says. But the thing is you can't understand a single thing he says or writes because of his horrible spelling and accent. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!!,0
"Professor Pilkington is very caring and always has a smile on her face! She is a great Spanish teacher and wants everyone to do well. Group activities help you get used to speaking the language instead of just writing or doing grammar. The activities are relatively simple but are helpful to do them. The class was fun and easy, so that's a win win!",1
"Dr. Aguilar is a great professor, even though i took her class in maymester she which was great overall. If i have to take another english class it would be her. Do not take maymester if your not going to read, arrive to class, or do work, you will fail!. She is not lenient at all when it comes to grading.",1
"Weighed way too heavily on the Aleks program. No in-class instruction, aside from answering students' questions one on one, which was not always helpful or clear. Didn't really teach, only intervened when she deemed necessary.",0
Misses Persaud's Spanish class was too accelerated for me :( Don't take the class if Spanish isn't your first language.,0
"If you're looking for an easy A then take Professor Nelson. If you're looking to learn anything at all then don't. I know she has a high rating because she is an easy a, but if I had known how little I'd get out of her class I wouldn't have taken it.",0
"Avoid McDougall at all costs. Very kind and approachable, but terrible teacher. His lectures are a lot longer than necessary and completely irrelevant to exam material. Very difficult grader on the group project, and will not help you if your group is non-cooperative. Just don't take his class.",0
"She wasn't clear, and taught based on foundations we were never taught. Her quizzes were tough and she asked for a lot of analysis in class which we were not equipped to do. Her exams were take-home, which was nice, although it meant a lot of work. She didn't answer questions very well. Overall, not the best linguistics professor I've had, by far.",0
"Assigned interesting readings but led very poor discussions. Anytime we got going, she took us off in a new direction using her buzz words she uses over and over. (Ex: hegemony, intersectionality, ideology). She also grades papers based on her politics and not on the quality of your writing or argument. The course is interesting, but she is poor.",0
He's horrible. I hated him with every fiber in my being. ,0
Please do not take this class.  She is the worst!!! The information in the text book was slightly used in class!,0
"Professor Stewart truly cares about his students, if youre struggling just ask him for help he wants you to learn. Theres a lot of homework and assignments and such but it all helps you learn the material.",1
I took Profesor Prasad PBL class for the spring of 2018 and I have to say I've never learned so much in a class. She made chemistry fun and easy to learn. It's chemistry and it's obviously not an easy class and with any science course it' one in which you have to work for your grade. If you don't plan on putting effort into the class do not take it,1
"don't even bother, doesn't have a lesson plan. often mixes the material she taught in your class with the material she taught at wayne state. if you want to reach her you must use wayne state email address.",0
"Don't recommend his class what so ever unless you have time. If you have a busy schedule DO NOT take his class but if you think you are capable go right on ahead. Just know he doesn't give direct answers to your question and he advises that you memorize his syllabus. In class he has really long lectures, pretty big reading and writing assignments.",0
"Often tardy and ill-prepared for her own lectures. Exam questions were sometimes vague or ambiguous (which is particularly vexing when the exam is proctored by someone else). Seems like a nice enough person, but come on, this is college, not the Adult Learning Program down at the Glen Burnie Community Center.",0
"His tests are a cryptic mess. Over half of the questions are unclear and have little to no connection with what he covered in class. Same thing with his homework, all the questions are unrelated to his slides, which is what he reads for lectures, or the textbook. I feel like he taught what HE believes is good software engineering, which is garbage.",0
"Everything on those power points. She is a little too happy, never seems sad or angry, talks to students like they're kindergarten students. TOO EASY CLASS, I felt like she wanted to help students pass, one of those easy prof. that have too easy class that doesn't really prepare you for BIO Series at UTSA. You will not find easier BIO Class at NVC.",1
"Misurda is easily the worst computer science professor in the department. Lectures are monotonous, no online discussion board for help, and seems to not care about feedback regarding his course. I have a high B in this course and have had to do all studying outside of the lecture. Avoid all of his classes if possible",0
Digiorgio is a very nice teacher and cares about her students. Her class was a cool experience and I would recommend it if you need a writing class or like poetry. I did not care for her sharing her political views and having to sit through class while she wastes time talking about them.,1
Easiest class I took! If you just do the assignments and show up to class you'll pass--the class is only pass/fail anyway. Professor Summers is so kind and realistic. He offered to take students on tours through the Nurse Learning Center. He also will add 10 people on the first day of class so go if you don't get in and you might have a chance!,1
There really isnt a problem with Anita. There are just too many assignments. I felt like I was in graduate school. I say take this class at a trade school for 100 bucks I think there are also free programs for medical terminology. Im retaking the class for free and transferring the credit over. Way too many papers and discussions a week,0
"Read the book, don't even bother going to her class unless you're spanish or someone who is very capable of understanding english w/ a heavy spanish accent. She is a really nice lady but her accent doesn't make up for it because if you don't understand her, you're screwed. Good luck to her future students.",0
"Kate Darling is a great instructor dont get me wrong. However, you have to do your assignments to what she is looking for, NOT what the criteria is asking for. It has to be her way, or your wrong. Even if it says otherwise in the text. She is very old school when it comes to teaching and grading. If you figure that out early, you'll do great!",1
"I took this class for TX GOVT. The class consisted of 4 quizzes and no final. The final grade was our 4 quiz grades divided by 4. The textbook I rented from Amazon for $25 bucks, but the quizzes are timed but if you read the textbook you will be fine. This was a flex class and an easy A.",1
She's an awesome professor.  If you'd like to learn Spanish...then this is the class you should take.  She's a lot of fun and she's great at what she does.,1
He is less than mediocre.  Avoid taking the class with him if at all possible.  He appears to grade papers by the seat of his pants.  He is unresponsive (or slow to respond) to questions.  I was pretty excited for this class *before* I took it.  He seems to have a knack for taking all the joy of writing out of writing.,0
"If I could add another tag, it would be ""Lecture Heavy""",1
"He was my poorest professor I ever had. He never gave out extra credits because they are not a necessity. He is a tough-grader on grammar( commas, periods..). He never gave us enough time to finish assignments.",0
"Amazing proffersor! He's always interesting in making you better at times he has that ""you should this by now"" attitude but if you don't he'll help you out. Just drink your coffee (can be a bit boring if you're feeling tired) but over amazing proffersor! Love him",1
"Bro, worst class I have ever taken. And its not the class or the material, ITS HER. her exams are unbelievably hard and are so much harder than the homework that takes us HOURS to do every week. She goes through things fast in lecture and is so bad at clarifying things because she literally only knows how to phrase things in one way.",0
"I took Intro to Education the first time he ever taught the class, but it was very good. The class is based on reading and class discussion, with three reflective papers and several short journals. He brings in actual high school teaching and leadership experience which is very helpful for students.",1
"Great teacher. I wasn't looking forward to this class but this professor is amazing! Weekly assignments are due every week, but she makes the assignments entertaining and gives good feedback and suggestions. Great teacher!",1
"I had her for the first time in Classifiers. She's always willing to help you out. There are a lot of videos (about once a week) but it's ASL, obviously there will be videos. Our last project was a presentation in front of the class and I was having a hard time thinking of classifiers for the story but she helped me make sure I had what I needed.",1
"Ignores student perspective. It's her way or the wrong way. Quizzes are confusing. The class topic is so easy to understand but somehow this professor mixes in her own ideas and it turns into a completely, hectic and confusing class. Despite receiving an A, I know that this class is a ""GPA Killer"". I wouldn't recommend this class, 3/10",0
"The worst teacher I have had in my college career.  I am not the best at math, and immediately sought out help for the class.  She repeats the same information over and over again in lecture, barely making it through half of what is required.  Went to office hours for help and she insulted my intelligence for not understanding. She is rude, no help",0
"This class is super easy as long as you show up to class. It's an introductory class on how to navigate Century and become a successful college student, super easy. No textbook requirements, any reading material she hands out at beginning of class. She was open with her personal life and cracked jokes too, it was a fun environment.",1
Professor Sinha is a decent professor. Her lecture slides can sometimes be disorganized but she seems to be knowledgable about the topic. She explains the concepts in an okay manner. You need to take detailed notes because she asks you little details on the test. She is also funny sometimes.,1
excellent teacher and mentor,1
"She is frustrating to say the least. Her grading is entirely inconsistent and arbitrary. She will leave you contradictory remarks on your drafts, and will mark you down a grade without explanation. She has her favorites and for some reason refuses to grade anonymously like most law schools do. She made me want to transfer schools.",0
"Not thorough. I am a very rigorous studier and, after giving it my all, I still felt I didn't understand. He doesn't seem to understand his own class! Unfortunate that he is the only one teaching ochem2 @ OCCC. My advice - take it somewhere else.",0
"Honestly, a super smart guy, knows so much about languages but sometimes forgets to simplify things. Always down to help, a little all over the place. Kinda clumsy. Gives enough practice in class that I hardly have to study outside of class. You have like 5 homework assignments the whole year",1
"DO NOT TAKE IF YOU ARE NOT POLI SCI MAJOR, you will waste so much of your time. This is an incredibly hard class and would not be worth it if its for Gen Ed. You have a 3 page paper due every week, lots of reading, and hard tests. Lectures are hard to follow, and he rarely gives feedback to you and if he does, its months later.",0
"The worst professor I've ever had in my entire life, I am about to drop out the course. She doesn't even know her material, only try to talk something relate to. I have learned nothing so far, so I highly recommend you not to take classes with her. She is not clear about what she wants referring to homework and you'll get bad grades.",0
"She is very knowledgeable. She helped me lose 15lbs. and was very sweet. Tests are easy if you read the handouts.  Participation and attendance are mandatory, its PE, duh! Different variations of squats and push-ups. She likes to focus on the smaller muscle groups that you forget about like in ur shoulders n butt. Ur gluteus medius has been warned!",1
"Didn't know this guys name until I looked it up. Very disorganized class. He talks the entire class, mostly about nonsense, then tells you to take a pop quiz. His talking makes you doze off and not pay attention to anything. His quizzes will feature questions on things he quickly covered that you wouldn't remember if he didn't tell you to know it.",0
Don't take this professor. She has a haughty attitude and is VERY moody!! She tries to make her students feel less than if they try to get clarification on a topic but she isn't so knowledgeable about the topic she is teaching.,0
"Johnny is amazing, I would highly recommend taking him for any classes that are offered! You can tell that he genuinely cares and wants his students to be engaged. I'm not a big fan of Econ but he really tries hard to make it a class you will enjoy.",1
"Gentil, beaucoup d'expérience mais passe trop de temps a nous compter des histoires. Apres ca il défile la matière en 10 minutes et tu dois lire le manuel pour comprendre. si tu fais les exercices tu devrais bien réussir l'exam. Qqun qui a deja fait de la compta ne devrait pas avoir trop de difficulté. Il refuse de repondre aux ques. pr la simul.",0
"Restricts creative freedom. You're practically forced to abstract your work to her liking before you can start painting. Style is redundant, it's mostly collaging images on Photoshop and regurgitating it onto a canvas. The readings and the questions are a pain. Lastly, it's drawing and painting, wish she didn't restrict it to merely painting.",0
He is the best prof I have ever had.,1
The. Worst. Teacher. Ever.,0
"Dr. Lamas is one of the best professors I've ever had. He's so knowledgeable about religious studies/scripture and his passion for the subject really pours over into his lectures. He's also just a really cool guy. He truly wants to see people succeed. So come to class, do the readings, work hard on the essays, and he'll meet you halfway.",1
"Dr. Kosnik is terrific! The class was fun and interesting. 2 tests, a final exam, and 2 concert reviews that everyone got A's on. I never cracked the textbook, and I got A's on all the tests. The lectures covered everything we would have read. Also, Dr. Kosnik is an amazing pianist, and he does demonstrations on the piano during class. Great class!",1
"He IS helpful and nice, although he doesn't look like!",1
DO NOT TAKE. She replies to concerns but Im warning you to not take this course with her. Honestly the hardest Ive ever taken and constantly felt stressed. Does not give you more time to finish work and does not give any considerations at all. Had to pay for 2 platforms which is really pricey! Just dont take it and do yourself a favor!,0
Hes a great guy. Hes caring to his students that show up to class and make an effort to participate. I learned so much in his class because he made me think. He calls on you randomly so you always have to be prepared. Take his class! You will learn and meet one of the greatest professors at PBSC,1
Mrs. Holmes is one of the best teachers I've ever had. She's very personable and definitely super caring. Her class is so fun! Lessons are very easy to follow step by step learning & she makes sure everyone understands the concept before moving on. She makes sure everyone participates. I would recommend her to anybody. Definitely choosing her again,1
"hes really calm and collected, does a great job at explaining the material and cares about his students. great professor overall. you will not regret taking his class",1
"He is the best professor so far, he really cares about his students. The lectures are fun.  He is really clear about the topics. There are 2quizzes 1 Midterm and 1 Final. Its an easy A if you understand the content, you dont have to study that much , just listen the songs and understand the influences.",1
"The tests are open-note and open book; HOWEVER, nothing she goes over in class is on the test. She is very boring; never knew I could sleep with my eyes open until i took her.",0
"Nice woman, but discusses things of little relevance to the subject matter. Helps brainstorm paper topics, which is beyond valuable for the papers, but most of the discussion section consisted of awkward silences as responses to useless questions. Add feminist elements in your paper to up your grade.",0
"Every project we done , no matter how well you did it , you never get an A grade from her class . She wouldn't give you the grade higher than B+. Be sure you drop all the notes and listen all what she said , she always ask some tricky questions on the exam.",0
"I go to ODU in Norfolk and had Professor Shapero her first year here. She was terrific; I had to retake 211 after not getting a C the previous go-round and she was great. She made it easy to talk in class and she helped me improve tremendously as a writer. Class is easy and stress-free. Papers aren't hard, little hw. Take her.",1
"I took CSC105 class last summer.If you really want to learn the Microsoft applications(Excel, Access, etc),I recommend taking it during the school year because you have longer on SimNet to practice the simulations. Dr.Vetter will allow you to progress the difficulty as far as you want. Excellent,caring,high intelligence,interesting.LearnMoreWithHim",1
"Only take him Only if you absolutely DO NOT HAVE any other choice, if you do have  choices , please take somebody else. Stay away from this guy, he doesn't help at all.",0
"This rude lady suck! Half of the class dont understand her ""English"". You wont know what you do in class. Give you suprise that she never taught you in class during final exam. GRADE STUDENT ON HER PREFERENCE.",0
"Strong accent, hard to understand",0
"Marchetti's ""flipped classroom"" is the worst. She doesn't teach, and you're graded on the precision of your labs. Aweful class. Avoid at all costs.",0
Class was a little difficult for me.. Hes a cool guy and loves to travel which you hear a lot about. Just study the notes on the slides and know your maps! Also you read a book that is actually good so dont worry about it. Funny Guy!,1
Great professor. She is big in citing your work. Do the work and you will pass. I would take a class with her again. She's very forgiving and easy to get in touch with.,1
"Does not really teach anything, assigns lots of reading and then has the students discuss it among themselves in class (and it often seems like she does not know what the readings are actually about).  The research papers that each LSFY-103 class is required to do are not research papers in her course - they are literary analysis papers.",0
"Dr. Teng is a good man, but you can tell he isn't passionate about programming. His lectures consist of him reading off of powerpoint slides in a monotone voice. He doesn't engage the class and since he uses a student grader, you don't get feedback on anything. I wish he gave supplemental information since the textbook is very basic.",0
"Class: Spectrometric Identification. VERY enthusiastic about topic, makes learning material enjoyable. More than willing to help out students with learning materialerpreting spectra of unknown compounds. Graded on midterm, 5 HW assignments (10 problems long&very time consuming), unknown lab report, and a final exam. Referring to book's HELPFUL",1
"Idk if it's because it's online, but he's great",1
I got to say. Im currently enrolled in her online psych 1 class and its not like the typical psych class. She treats discussions lile english exams and the topics are so mediocre on discussions,0
"Professor Cowherd, while well published and highly regarded in the eyes of faculty and the institute itself, is fundamentally lacking in teaching ability. His single assignment type and grading are overwhelmingly subjective and his elitist and arrogant personality make for an underwhelming and frustrating classroom environment. WILL NOT TAKE AGAIN.",0
"Great teacher, explains material clearly and has very do-able expectations for course work.",1
"She is just great. Nothing else, Her practice problems are always related to the actual tests.",1
He seems like he tries but he doesn't speak english very well and is kind of hard to understand especially if taking this class early in the morning. homework assignments are once a week and take a while and tests are kind of hard but other than that its okay if you can decipher what he is saying. wouldn't recommend to anyone really.,0
"He is a very hard professor.  He does have favorites, but he does not punish those who are not his faves.  His tests are ridiculously hard, but he does it to make you think through what you learned. IF you are up for a challenge and really want to learn something- he is the prof for you!",0
Gives out a lot of work. Super heavy lectures. Monotoned. Class feels super long. Doesn't take time to know students. Very dull teacher. No motivation.,0
"Best professor ever! you have to do a lot of work but if you do it you will get an A, he does not grade hard; he just look at it and that is it! TAKE HIM!!!",1
Takes away participation points for texting your mom during class. Doesn't ever give reasons for why she gives you the score you get. Inconsistent grader. Please don't take this professor pls.,0
"terrible professor, more concerned with mind games and messing with students that actually creating a decent learning environment, Avoid at all costs!",0
nesvig is one of the best teachers i've had. his class is easy and he is a really funny nice guy. hilarious.,1
"Honestly such a nice teacher who seems really engaged and interested in what she is teaching. If you're not a history major and are only taking this class as a general education requirement, don't take it. She expects a lot, the lectures are heavy in material, and there is A LOT of homework.",1
"I disliked this class for multiple reasons. He takes roll at the beginning of class and at the end. It's additional 5% extra of your grade and believe me you need it. My class was Tuesday's and Thursday's from 5:30pm-8:10pm. We stayed their one time until 8:20, just so he could finish his lecture and to take roll. Focus on concepts!",0
Very fair with hard tests.,1
"Listen. This professor has a decent enough rating on here, so maybe he used to be better; however, whatever he is doing now is NOT WORKING. There are about 10 students in the class left because everyone has already dropped. He's disorganized, forgetful, and will actually make you feel like an idiot in front of everyone for asking questions. AVOID!!",0
"Brad is very relaxed. He makes typical teacher jokes and has a teacherly sense of humor. He's very approachable and eager to offer help and advice. He's very laid back about attendance. He understands if you sleep in or can't make it. Attendance is stricter in the beginning, but later in the semester - very relaxed. He takes awhile to grade papers.",1
"He is a good professor, terrible spelling, but is passionate about physical activity and is very clear about what information you learn in class will be examined.  Knowledge of a few readings per exam is critical. Overall a good class.",1
"I took this class online. She had anywhere from 10-15 videos to watch a week. Some of them were 30-40 minutes. Her class consisted of labs, lessons, around 30 homework questions, and concept checks every week. She also required exams every other week. Her workload was very OVERWHELMING!!!! I have no intention of taking her again.",0
If you want someone who is never on time to class and never grades assignments then this is your teacher! I took her for comp 2 in the spring of 2016 and the only grade she entered was our final. I still have no clue what I made on any of her essays because she never posted them or have them back!,0
Louis is a terrible professor. He rants about subjects that aren't relevant to the topic being taught at all.,0
"One of the best professors you will ever have. Not only will she be there for you for this class but she will mentor and help with any other areas. SO nice! VERY sweet! Down to earth! Very fun class, easy A if you apply yourself and attend class. DON'T miss out on this professor, you'll regret it!",1
"Dr. Buchoff is by far the worst professor I have ever taken at UCF. She grades very harshly but does not give clear expectations in class. Every time I asked her a question she had an attitude and just told me to go read the textbook. She requires few assignments but they are each weighted heavily. Her lectures are pointless, I learned nothing.",0
"Doesnt really teach you one on one and everything I learn I had to learn on YouTube, all she kinda does is give you work and expect you to figure it out yourself. Not much help",0
Shes a really nice lady with good intentions but she goes way to fast through material and is confusing at times.  Definetly do your homework and all worksheets! If your not great at math i wouldnt take this course with her...,0
"I am still in this class right now. He is by far the worst teacher I have ever had. I was really sick and e-mailed him, he never responded back to me. Now I am behind by like 3 assignment and I missed one day. He is horrible at communication. He doesn't seem to care about the students even though he says he does. I would give him 05 if I could.D:",0
"He seems like a brilliant physicist but unfortunately he is more concerned with making the class laugh or awe at his math prowess.  The book for this class doesn't seem to corrolate with the lectures, but I suppose I learned something.  I'm just glad I have Mohrman this semester.",0
"Professor Schuster is passionate about teaching history and it helps make the class exciting.  He wears ties but comes off as casual--don't let this fool you!  He is actually demanding about things like coming in on time, being formal in email messages and proofreading your essays.  He is young but he is very ""old school.""",1
"Would ask questions in class/during test and he would say ""I didn't write the powerpoint"" or ""didn't write the test"". Skips through powerpoints all the time. He just doesn't teach well. Obsessed with teaching JMP software but you can't use it for tests?? Nice guy but not a good teacher. AP Stat is only reason I understand the class",0
I loved Mr. Goodman's class. Although he is quite monotone (and he knows it) he is a great teacher. I would recommend this professor to anyone!,1
"I have taken both Pre-Calc and Linear Algebra with Shea and he is a great professor. He is a fair grader and a clear teacher. You will probably have trouble if you are not math-minded though, as he does not speak down to the students in class; however, he is very open to helping students of every level in his office hours.",1
very nice person!,1
"Took professor Nelson on a 6week period for PSY230, best decision ever! She was very sweet and definitely wants you to pass! She is understanding and will answer your emails if you have any questions. 6week summer courses are very fast but she made it so it was not overwhelming! I love how organized she is. Would definitely take her again.",1
Do not take her.  Very disorganized and takes weeks to grade assignments.,0
very nice professor everyone likes the way he impart the class.he gives you advice of what questions would be on tests. he tell you what to study for possible questions very nice. i liked a lot his class. he won't teach for long only 2 more semesters and he will be gone so take his classes you wont regreat,1
Ridiculous with her grading. Not helpful with quetions or willing to help. Made this online class unbearable. Do not take this course online with her.,0
"Get ready to put up $$ for his book and access code in order to do the homework. Class is based on 100 points. If you like organization, do NOT take this class. Canvas is just flooded with all kinds of documents and he constantly goes off topic during lectures. Does offer a good amount of extra credit. Likes to hear himself talk.",0
"I took her compressed course with Math 115 & 125. One of the BEST professors I've ever had. Very passionate and caring about her job. She is always clear on her lectures, stops to answer your questions, and sacrifices a lot of personal time to review for tests. Lots of HW yeah, but its only to make sure you get the material stuck in your head!",1
"Professor Donato gives great lectures and knows how to make politics and functions of government more interesting by being controversial in a good way. However, there are about 6-7 major assignments/assessments for the whole semester and they are very difficult. I spent over 10 hours on both of his take-home exams and every paper was excruciating.",1
1. You can't understand him 2. He is picky on how you write your essay questions on the test 3. Will turn your paper down if it isn't a full 2 pages 4. You cant read his hand writing 5. We will let you retake your test but he huffs and puffs about it This is a 5 step warning you that if you take this class you will be miserable. MISERABLE!,0
"Very judgmental, constantly snaps back at students, does not make the work clear .",0
"Professor Rarick is my favorite professor at UT. He's funny, caring, and was always willing to make appointments for extra help. I had zero stats experience and did just fine because of this wonderful man.",1
I was in his office almost every day with questions. Took this class as a freshman (frowned upon but worth it) I think he saw potential in me and helped me a lot. ASK QUESTIONS outside of class bc he will answer them. This was an 8am and I looked forward to it every day bc I loved it. He makes class fun and you can actually have a convo with him.,1
Professor is very caring and passionate about the class. Exams are tough but there are a lot of resources to study. There are a lot of additional buffer grades and he drops your lowest exam grade. Overall I would definitely recommend taking this class.,1
Absolutely amazing! Love her!!,1
The way she does her class is nightmarish first she makes the most interesting subjects seem boring she basically allows you to cheat on ur online quizs does not have a midterm but a cumulative final that is guaranteed to screw u over 90 MC 5 T/F 3 SA doesnt do a review class because she believe that you should of been studying all year,0
"Literally the worst professor Ive ever had in my life. Hardly anyone passed the exam, and the average was around a 65 consistently for exams. Passionate about the subject but not good at teaching. Would not recommend",0
"He doesn't have any consistency in presenting the material. He uses outdated apps so he is not able to upload the material to the university portal and refuses to learn how to do it. He doesn't respect student opinions. I took Middle Eastern Architecture because I'm fascinated with it, but inconsistency got in the way of the learning process !",0
Weird guy.  Grades hard.  Boring lectures.  Guy's a total slacker.  Avoid if you can.,0
Boring class.,0
"Pros: super-organized, competent, and helpful. Cons: very strict, a TON of reading. She's a total professional and very smart. I had her for a COLL 100, so no tests, just a lot of reading and thrice-weekly Blackboard posts (which had to be pretty long to satisfy her requirements). A lot of work, but I learned a lot and really respect her.",1
"This class is very informative and easy. Just complete the two projects that she gives and you'll be one step ahead of getting an easy A. Professor Persampieri gives great feedback on your assignments, she's very elaborate when it comes to her powerpoints/lectures. Extra credit is also given after the midterm, and for the final project.",1
"If you do not like writing papers do not take this class. His finals consists of hand written essays on multiple topics, as well as a case study and a large practical. I personally did not enjoy his class but I know others who did. He makes his lectures fun and keeps them lively but this class was very tough learn so much in a short period of time",0
"People seem to either like her or hate her. I really liked her. Her quizzes do contain grammar mistakes which can make answering them a little confusing once in a while, beware of that. Otherwise, she is very nice, very understanding. Asides from the grammar, she is very clear and very willing to help. There's no surprises with her.",1
Professor Joyal made class so much more enjoyable and takes a humorous approach at teaching which ends up making things easier to retain. Marking is extremely fair and when you lose marks he is clear in giving feedback so he can give you a better mark next time. This gem marks in green pen because its less aggressive than red pen! :),1
"Makes philosophy as interesting as it can be, and is helpful in all aspects.  Interesting class.",1
Wow! Awesome teacher!,1
"Great person, I recommend her as an advisor.  She was always willing to help, but still vague.  It was a very challenging course and I just think I don't ""get"" cognitive psych.",1
Earth/physical science-- Study study study!! The tests are hard. There are very few assignments or quizes but make sure you do them. They are easy and help keep your grade up. The tests are rough for even the smartest students.,1
"Matt teaches exactly what you will need to know for the exams. Participate in lab and follow the manual. Ask questions, he'll only go deeper if you bring it up. Form groups to study the lecture notes and slides. His Nerd News facts are funny. Overall good professor.",1
Did not respond to emails well. She would respond sometimes and sometimes she would just ignore them. Unclear what points she wanted to teach. Little application of law.,0
"He is genuine and very passionate about his field. He is one of those professors that can keep the class interesting by relating topics to relevant issues. He is a tough grader, ask him if you have any questions but always answers his email. His main goal is to teach you the information but he does look out for your best interest. Would take again.",1
"He loves to tell hilarious stories in class, but don't let this distract you from taking notes. Understanding the notes and the chapters in the book are very important. Tests can be quite difficult, even if the material from class seemed easy enough. He is quite helpful though and provides a lot of opportunities for extra credit, just go to class.",1
"Tests are a few long answer questions, but VERY broad. She expects you to be an absolute expert in the subject matter, even though her notes are useless. The question may seem straightforward but it's not. In lecture she normally just rants about her experiences with plants and how amazing plants are to her. Go to the review sessions! Good luck lol",0
"AVOID AT ALL COST. She talked down to several students (including myself) and would laugh in your face when you made a mistake. If you asked her for help, she would barely look at your work & give feedback that wasn't helpful for example: ""I'm having a hard time reading this. It seems that you don't know how to form a sentence""",0
"Professor Field is the best. He cares deeply about his students and wants to see them succeed. Always willing to help, always willing to give you advice. Take him!",1
WOW!! If you want a heavy load of pointless busy work here ya go!! Endless assignments with little knowledge if any to gain from the piles of essays we have to do! There is'nt much to learn from Pro. Thornley so he overcompensates by swamping you with tons of busy work!,0
"She is very inspiring and motivating, but don't miss too much class.  Your scene partners will not appreciate it and she does not like it either.  And with good reason.  Its hard to perform with someone who doesn't show up.  She appreciates effort, even if you are not especially good.  She just wants to know that you are trying.",1
"Worst teacher I've ever had! Do not expect  him to be of any help to you during the course.  His ""lectures"" are nothing more than choppy random bits of info he's reading off a worksheet.  Do not take Mr. Hoagland! Seems to expect you to know everything right when you start too D:",0
"DROP. I was a 4.0 student with background in A&P when I took his class, and I still STRUGGLED for a B. When the class went from 50+ students down to around 15, he forced everyone to attend the same lab, regardless if it was the day they signed up for. I told him it wasn't convenient for my work, and he penalized me for it resulting in lower grade.",0
"I had to take this class though it isn't part of my major so I knew nothing going in but I felt like I left with a lot.  I can see why some people don't like him, he is the kind of guy you like or you don't.  But he knows a lot and is willing to help.",1
This is the worst teacher I have ever had. DO NOT TAKE HIM,0
"I am a Lancaster student but I have gone out of my way to take classes with Kamau in Zanesville, rather than the instructors at Lancaster. He truly cares about his students and as long as you do your work, you'll get an A.   His online classes are good too ",1
"She does not provide study guides. She is always late to class but requires her students to always come to class and be on time. She lectures to us as if we have a degree in Biology already. Every time you ask a question her response is 'Well, what does the book say?"". She is a nice lady but a HORRIBLE professor. Please do not take her seriously.",0
Dr. Houston is a fair teacher. If you don't read and study the class could be hard. Her test aren't easy. They require a lot of reading and studying. She's not as bad as these posts make her out to be. She is a very friendly professor outside the classroom but she is strictly about business when in the class. Just be prepared to work extra hard!,0
"Dr. Labelle is a good teacher, very kind, involved with the class and gives good feedback. This class, however, is challenging. The class is all about running the Rethink Campaign; that's all that you'll be doing. So the entire class is like one big group project all semester long. But, Dr. LaBelle was very helpful and responsive throughout.",1
He made me not want to take a Bio class ever again. ( he is not approachable),0
"Steve was a very clear grader, and tends to grade more on the student's side. He always answered my emails very quickly. This was intermediate algebra, which I was just taking this to fill out my degree (I've gone up to Calculus and was looking for a break), so I didn't think the work was that hard. I also took Steve for Calc I, and he was helpful.",1
She did not even know the answers to her own questions. I wished I would have looked on here at her ratings before taking her class. Someone at TCCD needs to test her understanding of business law! Don't take her class if you want to learn and be rewarded for your hard work with the correct grade you worked for.,0
"As a freshman teacher, Professor Bender is great. Although she gets caught up in her own thoughts, she's always available for help. She also lets you redo essays for better grades.",1
"The professor gives really good feedback and even lets you correct your tests. There is assignments weekly so its better to get them done as soon as you can as the week passes by quickly. Other than that, this class was relatively easy as long as you know what you're doing.",1
"He went very slowly through my linear class; very little new information was given each class. He generally goes over the previous class's lesson at the start of every class so you can honestly just go every other class and be fine with it. Also, he has a pretty nice beard.",1
"I don't recommend this professor. She's the type of person - if one student is doing something wrong she takes (whatever it is) away from everyone. To punish the one who did wrong, she punishes the entire class. The class is tough enough as it is. Unless you are fluent in French, you will not receive full credit on any assignment. Not caring at all",0
If he likes you you'll do ok. No clue how things really work in business but he spent all his time in the navy.,0
"Talked randomly about variety of topics that have nothing to do with the tests, no review or outline for tests. Nice guy, but c'mon man. Canceled class without sending an email, and would make you feel uncomfortable if you were late even though he was late 90% of the time. Didn't even know schedule for exams . 2 exams and a short quiz is not fair",0
"We gave 2 individual speeches and 1 group speech. The longest speech was 4-6 minutes. We had 2 tests, but you look the answer up in the book and write it down. Mr I is very understanding, but he is so respectable that you wouldn't  think of taking advantage of it. He transforms his students into public speakers. I highly recommend taking this class",1
not alot og good to say about this class. Alot of busy work that requires too much time for a gen ed class. She openly embarrasses students that give wrong answers. Takes forever to grade assignments. you have about 12 assignments in progress at once very confusing. Poor time management. the only positive thing is if you do the work you will dook,0
Good professor who is straight forward. Study the powerpoints and you will be fine. Keeps the class from being too boring.,1
Really helpful...lots of extra credit and study sessions. Fair...patient...helpful.,1
"Worst teacher I've ever had. She often seems very clueless, she just gave us a test that was over FIVE chapters and SEVEN power points, with 85 questions. She draws pictures on the board frantically that don't make sense. Does not tell you what you need to know for a test even when asked she will not make a study guide. Not organized or effective.",0
"I cannot learn from just reading a textbook, and thats how he teaches. I'm failing because he does not explain anything, he just stands up there and erads the book to us. I didn't pay for an online course, I want a teacher!I was so excited to start classes, and now I'm ready to quit.",0
"Worst professor I have encountered thus far. Like everyone else has said, we didn't get our first test back until a month and a half after we took it. He doesn't post assignments or readings until the night before they are due. He coughs and clears his throught 150+ times during class. Not helpful, arrogant. If you scheduled it drop it, now.",0
She was not clear with her lectures. Skimmed over a lot of the material and was not very thorough.,0
"This class has three major assignments: a PSA group project, midterm, and final. These make up most of your grade but the other small assignments should be easy As. He posts all his lectures (podcast + slides) online so you don't have to go to lecture. Go to discussion section because that is graded.",1
"One of my favorite teachers at Fullerton, I took History of Native Americans and he gives amazing lectures and cares so much about indigenous people and their culture. He has the easiest grading system, just read what he wants you to read before class and youll pass the class. If you dont come to class you wont pass. Easy midterm & final.",1
Elizabeth meadows is the worst professor I have ever had at CMU. I had a 3.6 going into this semester and generally do really well in classes and I ended the semester with a 60%. I even went to her office hours and asked for her help and said based on my scores I wasn't trying hard enough.,0
"Honestly just feels like he doesn't care about students and receives a lot more joy from getting to take points away from students than seeing them succeed. Terrible lecturer, decent slides, understood nothing from him talking, most things from the slides when he didn't use 500 slides to make a simple point.",0
Took her class online. Her Instructions are not clear for assignments that are not pre-outlined by the book. I informed her I was struggling with the class several times. Her response was rude+unhelpful and very unprofessional.,0
"Darin is the worst professor I have ever had. He never gave me any feedback on any of the work I did, which makes it hard to do well on tests if you don't know what you got wrong on HW. Very confusing, never made anything clear.",0
Great stories and pretty entertaining. Class is fairly easy and you don't have a book so everything is straight from notes and lectures. He loves talking about study abroad programs and has been to what seems like every country. When he talks about a region he usually has pictures of himself in these locations so it keeps you interested for sure.,1
"A really great professor! I took him for statistics. Everything on the homework is on the exams (if I remember correctly, there was 4 of them). I took this class online and the lectures were really easy to follow. As long as you watch all the lectures, take good notes, double check your home work, and ask questions, you will definitely pass!",1
"very great professor. helps out when needed. awesome class, awesome prof. awesome awesome awesome!",1
Hands down my favourite professor in my undergrad. Jim is passionate about coaching and challenging you to truly think about your choices. He sets clear expectations and gives good feedback for you to improve. His coaching classes have made me a more thoughtful coach. He is willing to meet to help with any challenges you have. Goes above and beyond,1
"Very difficult class, not sure if this is SCC mandated but this class really needs to slow down on the homework and give students time to learn the material vs rushing through it. Mrs. Conrad really cares about the students and wants them to succeed; but when test averages are in the 65% range it is time to reevaluate how the material is taught.",1
"She is passionate and give the best of her on class. She helps a lot but she grades are hard, fair but hard. The best teacher I had.",1
"I came to this class with some understanding of statistics.  I'm leaving wondering what the heck he was talking about.  As has been said, he teaches from the slides, which usually don't make much sense.  His lectures simply aren't clear and he doesn't seem to care.",0
"DO NOT TAKE!!! I had a horrible experience with my group and when I emailed her about it, she responded with ""There's nothing I can do"". Everyone in the group gets the same exact score, even if one person does more work than the others. There are also very long modules every week and quizzes with questions that don't even go along with the module.",0
I had Anton for 141 lab and recitation and it wasn't worth showing up for. The only reason to go is to get your quiz grades for recitation and to do the labs that take less than 10 minutes. Anton has a thick accent but you can still understand him. Don't try and get him to explain anything because he will just confuse you more. He is a nice guy.,0
"always unclear expectations. she talks down to students. the entire class struggles putting together assignments and essays, unsure of what she is wanting. low class test scores due to not covering the material clearly before test. very agrivating and stressful class. she's nice. but pretend nice. she does not care if you sink or swim.",0
"Nice guy, as long as you show up you'll pass.",1
"You meet one time a week in class, and she assigns group work and expects the group to work on it together, when we only meet once a week. Only grades one group members assignment as well, so if your group members don't do the work properly or at all, you can be penalized for their laziness. Assigns 2 part exams in one class, so not a lot of time.",0
Lectures are pretty useless. He asks the class to participate and waits more than 2 minutes for someone to answer. Really heavy accent. Boring lecturer. Hard grader on reaction memos. Midterm not that reflective of the book.,0
I don't know what people are complaining about. The material was pretty straight forward and the final was nothing special; you just had to understand the equation instead of only memorizing it.,1
She is not good about getting back to her students if you email her.  She doesn't use the PAL grade book so you have to ask her for your grades.  She is a very strict grader.,0
"I took online, had he is VERY hard to reach by email, he'd take more than a week and a half to respond; sometimes the thing I needed from him was already passed. 4 quizzes,2 exams, 5 discussion boards, and 8-10 page paper. There is an extra credit class on a Saturday; just go it is super chill. QUIZZES ARE HARD, READ BOOK!!!",1
Dr. Ferguson was a good professor. Just watch the lectures and take detailed notes. His lectures were very heavy and took a while to watch. You were able to use your notes on the exams and they were not proctored. All his exams were straight from lectures. I did not even buy the textbook. Chill guy.,1
"Would walk into class and say turn in papers, but other than mentioning things generally he never make clear what was due when. Turned in weekly journal entries but none were graded till the end and gave zeros for half of the entries because he said they ""were not MLA format"" but they were the same format as entries he scored as 100.",0
"Very nice professor who really knows her stuff, especially in the realms of globalization and modernization.  The freshman who referred to her as ""not a real prof."" obviously does not yet understand that Phd candidates are more than qualified to teach lower level classes.  She's also very easy on the eyes.  I highly recommend this class!",1
"I loved Adriano! He honestly really wants to see his students succeed and is really engaging and entertaining in class. He does require a lot of reading and expects people to participate, but he is funny and quirky and very lively.",1
The best Professor I have ever had. Completely engaged and passionate about what she teaches. She is incredibly compassionate towards students and really makes an effort to make everybody feel comfortable. Offers many extra credit opportunities. Must complete 45 hours of counter work to pass course.,1
"I took him for CEE 202 and it was awful. He isn't very helpful, and doesn't post his notes online. The online website we used (WileyPlus) was a hot mess. His tests were also really hard if you've never taken a probability course before. Overall, a very bad experience.",0
"His short fic class definitely requires the text book, as you must read every assigned story outside of class and bring a typed response for each of them every class, as the story and the students responses will shape the DEEP whole class discussion. Besides that, there are two major essays in the semester based on textbook as well + the exams.",1
"If you want to pass, you will need to teach yourself. He is extremely smart, but too smart to be teaching lower level. He said our class was a disappointment. also, his study problems were easy and seemed to trick us on the test (Extremely hardunclear)",0
"Lets you grade yourself, so you earn what you want. Just put in the work and effort. He did some really neat science lessons with us that I'll be using in the future. He's into the ""formal operational"" thinking stuff when it comes to science which was interesting for me to see. Let's students figure it out, rather than just being told.",1
"She is smart, kind, and caring. However, the workload is insane and completely unreasonable. The material is boring and you are expected to treat this class as a full time job... double shifted with overtime. Also, Dr. Weston puts mor emphasis on APA formatting than actual content. As stated she's a nice lady but I will definitely not take again",1
she is just great!!,1
"This is a horrible teacher. She is very unclear about assignments, and hardly replies to emails. I emailed her asking for more clarity on our essay, she never replied. If she doesn't like your writing, she will let you know in the margins. She believes white men are terrible, very melodramatic, seems to be very religious, also against certain races",0
"Loses temper easily. Even if you have an excused absence, he will get annoyed and will not let you make up work. My friend told him weeks prior that she had a surgery and he said that was too early to tell THEN later told her if she doesn't take it on the day she was planning on leaving that she will get a letter grade off. Nice guy, rude prof.",0
"Saralina is pretty great. Very bubbly and energetic and makes a speech class a little more exciting. She is a tough grader and if you don't complete assignments or show up to class then you might have difficulty. Overall, she was pretty fun and I enjoyed how she brought the discussion of art related things into what we were learning.",1
"Professor Hess is really sweet/fun (has a MAJOR shoe fetish) Although I did well in her class, she's a bit of a scatter brain (unorganized & forgets alot; complains about having too many papers to read/grade. Overall, I wouldn't say I learned much in her class. Basically, if you get decent grades on compositons & exams, her class will be a breeze.",1
"Took Public Speaking Spring 15. Class was easy because I took Speech Comm in Fall 12. I somehow still got a B, did the math and it was because of the tests on book material we never specifically reviewed ever in class. If you're not shy in a classroom and can do some research for a speech, this class should be fine for you.",1
"Frau Adam was a fantastic professor. She cared about her students, and taught really well. Class was never boring. There's a LOT of homework, but it's necessary for success. The class moves very quickly which makes it hard to keep up, but that isn't her fault. Put the work in and you'll do great.",1
"Meadows is by far the worst professor I had at CMU. Her class is near impossible to pass, I study hard and do my PsychLogs and I still receive bad grades. She is rude to students and not helpful what so ever. I have not had a professor as bad as her ever at CMU. I do not recommend her  or her class!",0
"He's really down to earth, makes the class fun so you aren't checking out the clock every five minutes. If you love writing he will make your passion stronger, and if you don't he will make you interested anyway. The only thing is that I was always distracted by the thought of having sex with him because he's hot...just being honest.",1
Very nice and chill guy. He cares about his students. Gives a lot of extensions.,1
"I'll be honest here, I have never put in as much effort as I did with 116. I went to tutors, I went to the east wing, and numerous other places. I failed this class. Ontop of the confusing subject matter, he tends to ramble in class about barely related topics, such as the history of math. He is a nice guy, and is intelligen, but not a good teacher",0
"You will have homework due every day, but it is pretty easy and he usually gives most of the answers in class the day before. Goes over everything you need to know. The material is surprisingly easy if you pay attention. Tests are too long though. Most people run out of time. Too much reading and writing. Nice and funny guy though.",1
"-This teacher has hearing aids so speak loud and clear, if not he will NOT answer your questions nor look in your direction -If you know Spanish this class will be easy but if you do not know Spanish it maybe a struggle, I say team up with others in class and do all ONLINE work -Professor does not give any reviews for test-study book/online assign.",0
"The material is not clearly laid out for any of the assignments, she doesn't grade anything or give feedback until the week of finals. Her quizzes are hard, weekly assignments that are long. She also is just an ununderstanding professor, don't come to her with any issues she doesn't care",0
Brother Daniel Maria is a Franciscan gem. He is so passionate about what he teaches and wants his students to feel the same way. Class is reasonable and lets you determine how bad you want your grade; no busy work. Take him.,1
"Professor Ferrero is SO sweet. She's awkward but you can really tell she loves what she does. Her class is an easy A, but if you want to learn biology you will. Even if you don't need bio for your degree, don't start slacking just because the assignments are easy; there are a lot of in class activities so you have to show up.",1
"Let me clarify to the people who are thinking about taking this Professor class. Dont do it . His grading criteria is insanely impossible to pass, he openly encourages students to drop his course. That should speak to the character of this Professor, there are Professor at this institution that are horrible Professor Fallon is one of them.",0
"Jose Juarez is a very great teacher. You can tell he cares for his students, and he will help you in any way possible.",1
"THIS PROFESSOR IS HORRIBLE. I STRUGGLE WITH ESSAYS AND  AS I TOOK HIS ENGLISH 21 CLASS, I FELT LIKE I DID NOT LEARN NOT ONE THING. YES, I PASSED HIS CLASS BUT IT WAS A STRUGGLE. I HAD TO DO MY OWN RESEARCH ON HOW TO DO A PAPER. EVERYTIME I ASKED HIM FOR HELP HE WOULD COME UP WITH SOMETHING TOTALLY OUT OF THE SUBJECT.",0
Professor was super boring in my opinion. Only went to the first 2 or 3 lectures and went to every discussion and passed the class with an A+. A lot of reading for the class but I didnt read a single bit.,0
For a gen. ed course this was probably the hardest class I've taken at BU so far! She expects wayyyy too much out of her students when over half aren't majoring in ENVS! She doesn't give study guides you are just suppose to look over the notes and her exams are ALL SHORT ANSWER! I was happy when the class was over,0
Hes adorable and hilarious. he has great spirits and an overall incredible individual with an awesome skill at teaching!,1
"Not so clear (Russian accent), not very helpful in general or understanding of student needs.",0
"I have Dr. Palmer for S&P, and I really like him. His tests are all based off what's in the book, and he doesn't spend class time teaching the material. He mostly just goes over some experiments and talks about why they happen. Tests are difficult and about what's in the book. Read that and you should be fine.",1
"Professor is not the greatest. His lectures are based on average 4 powerpoint slides but lecture lasts about an hour. But if you go to review day and get what is going to be on the test, the test are pretty straightforward.",0
"He doesn't exactly know what he is doing I feel like.  He is an easy grader, even gives you partial credit on multiple choice.  so if you want to BS your way through a B, then this is a great class.  But everything is from the book, I didn't learn anything from his lectures.  He doesn't communicate what he wants to teach very well.  Hes a nice guy",0
"snoble a little bit,",0
"Her classes are extremely boring.  Although she does let you copy her slide shows from her website, you still have to show up for class... and all she does is read the slide show to you.  And she cant dress appropriately (stomach hanging out) but tells you to dress for your mentor teacher. I dont quite understand that. And group work? come on!",0
"Where do I start? She has no clear idea what she is teaching, her reflection quizzes doesn't help in my retention of the material that is covered(if its covered). She doesn't place all the assignments somewhere where it can be easily accessed and seen (almost costing me). And her grading system for group projects doesn't reflect fairness.",0
"Great Professor. She's young and relates things we learn in class to up to date scenarios that interest us. She gives you review sheets for her tests which is very useful. Her homework assignments don't take too long and are very useful when preparing for a test. Overall, one of the best professors Ive ever had. Highly recommended",1
"Tests were all symbolic, 'say you have capacitance= C1 and Inductance= I, what would be the current on Resistor R2', it gets old when you have to go through proofs on the tests",0
"Flipped class, where you watch a pre-recorded lecture before class and spend the entire class reinforcing in the form of a recap followed by a 3-5 person group packet. One person in the group gets graded, groups switch roughly after each exam. Terrific class. HW is on MML, and grades are posted quickly to MML as well. T/A present, which helps! ",1
"ok teacher. slight attitude problem and rushes through things and is kinda impatient. shows preference toward kids who already know a little spanish already. not too tough of a grader though, fair. heavy textbook usage too.",0
"I've been attending Leeward for 3 semester and he is, by far, my favorite teacher. He knows how to make you laugh so class goes by quickly and I found myself wanting to stay longer. And of course, his teaching is very clear to understand. Amazing teacher.",1
"Just took his CHE seminar last semester and wanted to let anyone know taking it, he will try and scare you but don't fall for it. First day of class, he gave ridiculously hard ""quizzes"" and 17 people dropped that day. More dropped along the way. In the end, EVERYBODY got an A or a B. Bs for the ones who barely showed up. Just stick with it. Easy A.",0
Just try your best to don't choose this instructor. Loved design classes until i choose him. Class is easy he makes it terrible. He is a nice person and a good engineer but not a instructor. Marek if you ever see this just give up. You been teaching for 15 years and i am still saying this. I would give you a 0 but website won't allow me.,0
"Resourceful, connected, and respected. His lectures are very practical and taking his class helped me focus my future career prospects. Available for feedback and pays attention to student needs and questions.",1
Really cool lady! I would definitely recommend taking her class. I bought the book and didn't ever use it because the powerpoint covers the quizzes. As long as you have the review answers you will pass the class.,1
Avoid at all costs.,0
Very confusing professor.,0
"She read from book and ranted about the material. Its graded mostly on test scores. No study guides!!!!!! I read the book from cover to cover & took notes. Received a ""B"". I'm not happy considering it was a ton of work. She expects you to memory recall any given detail out of the book that she chooses for the test. Don't take if you need ""A+"".",0
"If you have just a passing interest in history, you will love this class. A narrative lecture style is never confusing or overwhelming. The material is clear and concise. He likes 5 paragraph essay style papers, which is good and bad. Might be too easy if you can write. Highly recommended for anybody looking for intellectual stimulation and drama.",1
"Randy is the bomb as a sculpture teacher, inspires you to do your best. Is a very relaxed teacher that gives a few tests but not a ton. Randy gives you freedom to create your version of the projects and appreciates effort. Not everyone in the class is an ""artist"" or has the skill but he makes u feel u do.",1
This guy will give you a zero if he doesn't like what you write on case studies. Most professors will give you some points but no this guy he is either a zero or an A that is it. Don't try to speak to him about it he wont care.,0
I absolutely loved Sara. I was so lucky to take her during my first semester just before she left for sabbatical. Super kind to her students and was always super interested in what students had to say about the scripts at hand. A queen.,1
"AVOID THIS TEACHER! She creates her own tests and the answers are often wrong even when counted right by the textbook! When I asked her a simple question, she had to use Google to find the answer! This class has been one of the worst experiences I have ever had, and I hate having to worry about this so much. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!",0
I took discrete math online. Take notes and do homework because its the same on the test. I recommend him!,1
"Doesnt like to answer questions. When you ask, shell say look in syllabus. Syllabus is so disorganized that its not comprehensive. Nothing makes any sense. Even if you are a fantastic writer, shell have something negative to say. Makes you redo hw 15 times. Gives 3x the work bc she cant do things normally. Very backwards. Sink or swim.",0
"He is a great teacher. He knows what he is talking about and loves history. There are three papers and some reading. Not to bad, though.",1
"One of the best classes I've taken at UMD so far. Professor Nusraty knows a lot about Afghanistan and is great about answering any questions you have. Plus, he brings in multiple experts in the field of diplomacy, which is super cool. Not too much work, more focused on understanding of the issues. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone!",1
"He has some good lecture notes, and this is the only good thing about him. If you think you can learn Matlab, latex, or maple with a book by yourself, don't take the class. If you need someone to teach you, find someone else.",0
"Abdallah is amazing! Great teaching and examples, and he always encourages his students to succeed and does his best to do so. With such trying times, he keeps proving to be a great prof. It is obvious he is trying his best to help his students succeed while maintaining a reasonable amount of fairness and integrity.",1
"She's extremely entitled. She says she is 'strict' under the guise of just being relatively self-important. I say this because she doesn't listen enough to her own students & demeans them. In a speech class, where students have to speak even when they have social anxieties, why is a professional in the subject demoralizing and degrading them?",0
Hes very dry but funny. actually enjoyed class. If you show up you will pass,0
He is really nice and friendly. He gives everyone a fair grade. I had the class 4 times a week in the morning but it wasnt that bad. Gives homework and labs to help with grades. He is a very understanding teacher.,1
"Lauries class is very easy. You should definitely show up as the online quizzes are very very easy if you have notes. Questions are taken directly from what she says in class. No homework, just 4 (easy) essays and 5 (25 Qs) quizzes thats are all online. And no final!",1
she is the worst teacher I have ever had I hated her class and dreaded going to it. she is boring and is just ughhhh. DO NOT TAKE HER. avoid her at all costs,0
"super cool guy, laid back class. attendance isn't strict, neither is late work (as long as you turn in all projects by the end of the semester). gives a lot of feedback during grading, and overall just a fun teacher to have for art class.",1
Is not attentive to students. She does not answer emails. Grading is straight foward but assignments are beyond confusing. Textbook used is confusing as well. ,0
She is smart and knows her stuff. No doubt about that and she is a good person at heart but I wish she could at least see how it is for first time learners when it comes to micro. We don't have a PhD in that field and need more time then what was given to UNDERSTAND. I took anatomy and so much other required classes for nursing major. I couldn't de,0
"Don't take marketing with her. Night class sucks the way it is; she makes it worse. She reads directly off the powerpoint slides the whole time, but takes attendance for points so you have to go. You'll have a marketing plan that gives hardly any direction & takes hours of outside work & still fail. Her tests are nearly impossible, so good luck.",0
"Professor Flores is an activist, intellectual, mental health clinician, and a very pro-student professor-- unlike most at Davis.  I regret not having taken her courses earlier.  On a side note, Yvette, Sergio, and Angie are the best people in the Chicana/o Studies Dept.  Very inspiring individuals.",1
"Marino has been far the most unorganized professor. I have never been more confused in a course in my life. Waste of money, if you take his class beware you will have to learn everything on your own with no professional guidance. He always called out and embarrassed his students as well.",0
"The worst teacher ever, ifyou see your going to take a class that she's teachong... RUN AWAY! RUN AWAY!!!!!!!!!!",0
"Very smart guy, but not good at teaching. If you took Calc in high school, you'll get to really appreciate how much he makes relatively simple concepts sound like rocket science. He embarrasses students for asking questions and for some reason he really has something against community college. Hes funny sometimes, but thats about the only positive.",0
"He gets pretty upset at times, but as long as you're on his good side it's okay. I thought I deserved a higher grade, but didn't receive it due to a ""mix-up""",0
"Strange teaching style, but not impossible to pass his class.",1
"i definitely recommend this class...nelson is a great teacher and knows the material.  he makes the lectures really fun, and has really corny jokes.  the material is kinda hard but he tells you exactly what he is looking for. make sure you attend lectures",1
"He's a good teacher, he just never tells makes it clear what homework he wants done, just posts is online. And his grading criteria is an age old mystery.",1
"This class was honestly the best class I had ever taken at the U. Not only was the material interesting and engaging but Professor Nesvig delivered it in a great manner! So grateful to have taken this course, take him if you have a chance!",1
Dr. Konen is amusing and does not give out much homework. Always tries to keep class interesting with jokes. The powerpoint slides can get boring if the earth and science isnt your thing. Overall would take again.,1
"if im being honest, i went to only one class in person and skipped the rest. prof richmond wants her students to succeed, so she is straightforward with everything. the quizzes are very easy if you read some, and the tests arent bad either. all online. very easy A!",1
"I took professor Varghese and basically felt on my own the whole time... Even though I got a good B, his tests are nothing like his presentations, they come from the book. He reads the presentations word by word EVERY lecture, and there are no reviews or can tell you whay to expect on any of the 2 practicals. Study all your labs will be his reply..",0
"He's just awesome.. He makes lectures interesting to listen, and he has a lot of flexibilty on grading if he knows student is trying.",1
Prof. Parsons was a pretty cool teacher. I took his arts and crafts course and it is mostly drawing and painting. One of the biggest assignment of the class is a book that you draw/paint and then bind it yourself.  It's a cool class because you work with lots of new mediums. but be ready to spend around 80$ on supplies. but there is no textbook,1
The professor can be disorganized but she's very understanding. It's not hard to get an A as long as you do the labs and she drops the lowest quiz grade. There's a lot of reading but she summarizes them in lectures and she was lenient with handing in labs late. She's genuinely caring and her dog is really cute.,1
Hes super cool. Great funny teacher. Hes very chill especially with assignments. Wish i got to take his class in person but it was still fun online.,1
"""Fatbody"" If you pay attention you will do fine, but this guy is so unorganized and out to lunch it's unbeleivable. some of the stuff he says will just make you dumber, he likes to make up his own words too which is kind of funny.",0
Professor Knott gives good feedback but when she gets frustrated she lets it out on her students. She is a tough grader. I like her personality a lot and you can tell that she cares but I just wish she didn't grade like everyone was becoming an English major. She doesn't realize that people take this class because it's a requirement for an AA.,0
The essays assigned are almost impossible to get an A in. The essay prompts are also poorly written. His expectation on said essays is very different from just about everyone's previous writing styles (which he will deduct points for).,0
She is really nice and always willing to help!,1
"He does not explain things well in class. I don't have the clue of what to review after class. Many problems in the test are not explained well in class. As a non-CSD major, I have to say that, DO NOT take this class just for the biological science credit, choose other classes instead.",0
"This was one of the most difficult classes I have ever taken. His lectures are super engaging but he doesn't stop to review/clarify concepts that might have been forgotten. There are so many lecture quizzes and lab quizzes which can be both beneficial and harmful. His tests are super specific and vague, but it taught me where to focus my studying.",0
"Be ready to get outside help from tutors, SI, or other classmates from the beginning of the class. There are homework problems. Do them before class he lectures about them! This is a class that you have to stay on top of. He doesn't really explain the example problems in class.",0
"Brilliant theoretical math professor, but can't really teach lower level math. His accent makes following already shaky lectures very difficult. Asking questions is pointless, he doesn't understand you any better than you understand him. If you already know calculus or read the book, you can scratch by.",0
"Sister Gallini is fantastic! Very helpful and responsive. This course is the same no matter who your instructor is, it's an already prepared online class. There is groupwork and each member gets a turn taking the lead in the group. I had a conflict on the week that I was supposed to be the leader and she easily accomodated me.",1
absolutely do not take his class. this man should not even be employed. he plays favorites like its his job and will make the peoples lives he doesnt like a living hell. he acts like hes grading a harvard students paper. he grades so tough to the point where its ridiculous. he took off my introduce yourself discussion board. like what?,0
Completely aloof. Doesnt communicate at all. Doesnt respond to emails.,0
"She is very kind and loves to help. She offers extra office hours if the class seems to be struggling. Very caring teacher, her comments really help!",1
"Dr. Gelderloos is a wonderful lecturer and a respectable man. However, I can't recommend his class to people who are trying to maximize their courseload or who are working. He gives an outrageous amount of work, easily several times more than my other upper level classes. His classes are difficult because of this. Have free time? Yes, take him.",1
"Terrible. Unclear lectures, exams too long, no sense for basic things like class prereqs/posting homework solutions before exams, talks too much about how simple the concepts are/how everyone should get them (several times/lecture). Homework was lectures ahead of us conceptually more than once. And all this was *before* classes went online.",0
"Best English Teacher ever!! She will work with you and help you. She grades fairly and honestly. Sweetest person ever.!! Also, you will learn a lot from her. From her teaching style to how to write properly she's the best.",1
first impression was a strict b*^!h. turns out Roxy's pretty cool,1
Li Liu is a solid teacher. Her presentations in class and her assignments helped me learn the content of the course well. You're definitely going to need to do some work outside of class but not an extreme amount. She's a solid teacher if you're looking to learn about communication,1
"Knows her stuff as far as English goes, but makes a few too many assumptions about other things. If you have a passion for the intricacies of English, more power to you, but not everyone feels this way and often times this class that you'll fail for a couple absences is a waste of time that could be spent on the unclear papers she has you write.",0
"Patty definitely does love the subject she teaches, and is a very nice person.  However, her classes are very dull and boring, and usually cover material that never appears on tests.  Her marking is also really hard! I would avoid taking a class with her at all costs!",0
"Ive taken all of the calculus sequences and passed with an A in all of them. Hes a great lecturer, but often his lessons are not as structured as you may expect. He always told us that he lectures off the homework, meaning he will display the homework problems and base his lecture off how to solve that problem set. Hes a great and funny teacher.",1
I would NOT recommend taking his class. Maybe the first two days of class is good only. If you make it to class 4 minutes late you won't be able to get in. Which he has just arrived 2 minutes late. Tough grader. Doesn't give feedback on essays. Expects you to know your errors. No enthusiasm. Lectures feel like you'd rather be somewhere else.,0
"Worst english professor I have ever taken. Never goes over her expectations in the course, or what she is looking for. Weird deadlines, and just unrealistic expectations. Then at the end there is a wonderful essay during your final that she never even brings up. Don't worry about it though, it's not like it's your entire final grade or anything.",0
"Dr. Sweet-Cushman the lecturer and mentor is amazing. Dr. Sweet-Cushman the grader is unforgiving. In order to get above a B- you have to perfectly meet all requirements outlined on the rubric and then ""provide further analysis."" Your writing style becomes conditioned to quantity over quality. She likes when you relate topics to recent events.",1
"Story and Structure. I didn't like her much for this class. I felt like I didn't really learn anything. She was very unhelpful when I was having issues with a paper and told me it wasn't going to matter much, but then I got a D on the paper and it really brought down my grade.",0
"Thermo is hard. No doubt about it, and it's going to take a lot of work to do well, but it's possible. He's willing to help if you're willing to put in the work to try and figure out what you don't understand before coming up to him. Very rewarding class in the end, and the better you do here, the easier Kinetics will be.",1
"I took the same class as the disgruntled student below and I have no idea what they're talking about. Anne's class is straightforward and coherent: the lecture is relevant to the homework, which is relevant to the exam. She is a fair grader and offers additional help sessions and practice exams.",1
"He has a great personality, hes hilarious. But when it comes down to teaching, he just isnt good at it. It felt like I had to teach myself, he goes too fast in lectures and really isnt clear on things. Dont bother emailing him because he takes too long to answer them.",0
EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. Rude and unprofessional. If you don't already basically have a masters degree in physics he is going to make you feel stupid. Doesn't care about his students or their comprehension of the material.,0
"I really like her as a person but I didnt care for this class.  She likes to write all over her Lecture slides and all over the white board during lecture, she was all over the place and throwing out too much info. She would write stuff out that you didnt need to know. But she is more than happy to help you if you ask for it.",1
"Boring lectures. Long lectures. Lots of reading. He has some quirks, which makes him a little better. 3 papers, 1 project. 8 homework packets. Takes off your two worst homework grades at the end of semester. Present portions of your essay sitting down. Lots of discussions. Can be hard to follow. Regret taking this class, but got an A.",0
Great professor that is passionate about his work and wants you to learn the material,1
He is a nice guy and does put effort into this class; but he is very awkward and expects the large majority of the information to be learned in the textbook readings. He is very vague on what he wants and his essay test questions are no different. The entire class was just a very Awkward vibe.,0
Bets Math teacher ever.... He explains you over and over until you get it. I highly recommend him.,1
"Professor Parker is the greatest! She is super nice, easy to understand, and makes herself readily available. The class wasn't easy, but I would definitely take math with her again.",1
"Just a very bad teacher, very unhelpful and doesn't care for students. Tests are ridiculously difficult for no reason. He's assessible if you make an appointmet but offers you no help.",0
"She is a good professor. She meets us every week and answers questions carefully. But her exams are really really hard! She gets curve the grade. I read every slide carefully, and I went over the Review sheet all afternoon. But the exam has nothing to do with the review. This is an online class, and everyone I know in this class is complaining.",1
"Really funny, I thought Id hate chemistry, but with her teaching Ive gotten a lot better",1
"There is no grace period for lateness. Once you miss your name when he calls attendance, you're late, end of discussion. Relies heavily on the text. Readings must be done. Tests can be easy if you study. Pop quizzes.",0
"He said that the grade would be 50% midterm and 50% final, but ended up grading based on participation only. Doing the readings & ""optional"" writing assignments are helpful for participating, but often assigns too much hw and doesn't explain the content clearly, so it can be hard to participate.",0
"Great teacher. Very clear on the subject, and goes slow to allow all to follow. Answers questions and explains in great detail. The only way to fail this class is to put forth zero effort. His reviews are amazing, and very helpful. If you ever get lost, he is happy to help and get you back on track. ",1
"she's an over all good teacher. She helps you with work and gives corrections on tests if you need it. She uses differant color chalk to better distinguish problems and answers, helps anyone in the class that needs help. she speaks clearly and will go through most problems slowly if someone requests it. Not the best teacher but one of the top 10.",1
Would NOT recommend taking her classes. Lectures are all off slides and she does a very poor job of teaching an intro CS course. Will take off many points on homework assignments even when the code runs correctly just because its not written exactly the way she wants it. Dont take her if there is another professor teaching the same class.,0
"One of the worst profs I've ever had. She doesn't look at the students when she lectures or acknowledge your existence. Seems like she's reading off her slides but all she says about the artworks is that they are ""important"" because they ""changed things."" Pointless. The TA marked everything and I did really well in the course but she was awful.",0
"Not the worst professor, the accent can be a bit hard to understand at times, especially since lectures tend to move fast. I sometimes struggle to listen to what she is saying and write notes down. Sometimes I end up just doing one or the other simply because you have no time. Office hours with her are almost a must, they have helped me a lot",1
"Funny guy, but very hard to follow. A lot of homework, quizzes and 4 exams.. Have not learned anything from him, had to find everything on my own.",0
"Mr. I is a great coach, he truly cares about the students. He teaches tools that will make you successful in life. He is very professional and loves his job. He makes sure each student is comfortable in their environment, to deliver their speech.",1
"An exceptional teacher. I took her immunology course as a nonmatriculated student updating coursework for a second career. She inspired me and I have built upon what she taught; the stuff I learned from her proved truly foundational. I'm a veterinarian now. Among the undergrad profs who inspired me the most, she ranks among the very few at the top.",1
Prof. Chase was easily the best professor Ive had at MJC so far. His lectures are interesting whether youre into astronomy or not. I visited his office hours with a few questions once and he did a great job giving a one on one explanation to make sure I understood the material. The weekly quizzes are a breeze if you study the notes he gives!,1
"The amount of papers came in at about 1 a week but with three textbooks with multi-chapter reading, its easy to fall behind. And then when feedback is given its not as helpful as youd think. He knows what hes talking about but hes fully disconnected from a students schedule and ability to write a perfect paper, read everything and come in.",0
"Had her for Personal Fitness Rude, disrespectful. Mocks you when you work out if not up to her standards. It's a 1 credit class and she treats it like three credits. One of the worst teachers I've taken at this college. Think very hard if you're going to have her.",0
She's ok. I wish I didn't take this class.,0
"Does not explain his grading for the homework, which is 50% of the total grade, lectures are fairly well organized but also fairly boring.",0
"To sum it up, Vannozzi was the absolute worst professor or teacher that I have ever had. He expects you to pass everything in on time, or you will lose 50% of the grade, but it takes him more than a month to pass back homework. He is impossible to make meetings with, he is unclear in his lectures and just does not know how to teach. DO NOT TAKE",0
"i Highly reccomend this prof to anyone into music. guzzone is very knowledgeable, has alot of experience, is crystal clear, and is very good at keeping your attention. classes are never boring, he uses all sorts of media to keep your attention - music, movies, and combinations of the two.",1
"Professor Morrow is one of the best math teachers ever!  Do your homework, attend lectures, and ask for help!  His exams are straight out of the book so you can study the chapter tests and pass with ease.  He is more than willing to help you in any possible way he can.  Highly recommend!",1
"If you aren't a serious student, avoid Anne. PAY ATTENTION, she moves fast (carpal tunnel syndrome mid-semester). Doesn't believe in multiple choice so you better attend those generous study sessions. Don't like writing? Move along. She loves those long, grammatically perfect essays with pesky footnotes. Intimidating but a wealth of information.",1
very nice teacher,1
"Liebman is an artless teacher that imparts ZERO knowledge to her students. Only with this woman could the topic teeter from Cicero to Oprah, and stay at Oprah. For taking her you will have lost your money, time, and in the world some measure of faith.",0
"She's very opinionated and you might as well not waste your time disagreeing with her. ONLY take her if you are taking very easy classes because you'll need to dedicate an awful lot of time for her reading assignments, and you can't get away with not doing them. I did learn a lot but it wasn't worth the stress and workload.",0
Class was hard and teacher went off on random talks about her views. I wish I could say something good about the teacher but it was the worst experience in my college career.  If you want less stress and more time in your life than please dont take this teacher.,0
"Get ready for boot camp, because that's what you get. Non-stop work, she seems to flaunt how many students she has turned into the Deans for plagiarism. Very strict on everything, there is no room for anything but what she wants and when she wants it, and it is a lot.",0
"Has an accent but it is not hard to understand. Homework is assigned every week & you have 1 week to do it. His test are similar to the review handouts he places on his website, but do not ONLY use those to study, refer back to the HW too. HW is all on the interweb. After the first exam, things get a lot harder. Try to take a different professor.",0
"it is hard to understand her lectures, however her quizzes are super easy and help your grade. the exams consist of a lot of studying from the book since her lectures aren't the best. its doable, you just have to work for it. she's a nice lady and would respond to my emails. offers extra credit. final is online , I recommend her if you're not lazy",1
Good woman...bad course...bad teaching style,0
"You're going to have to rely on your textbook. She rambles  and goes off-topic during lectures, mentioning things she thinks are ""interesting"" but they're really unnecessary to know. We don't have any study guides or review in class for tests. She keeps wanting to make it more challenging for us without teaching us the basics first so we get lost.",0
"He just talks and talks, no textbook needed in this class but you will have no idea what is he talking about. There isn't any references in the book, since oh yeah we don't have a book! If you see him in his office, be prepare that it will take at least half an hour, even if you only have a quick question. He will not stop talking!",0
"This is one of the worst professors at Trevecca. He's a great guy outside of the classroom, but he's a joke. He requires you to attend many events OUTSIDE of class for multiple grades including the weekends. He doesn't even know the material he's teaching and will pick a fight when he's in a bad mood. He doesn't seem bad at first. Just wait.",0
"his class is horrible. He just uses textbook powerpoint and extremely hard tests. I thought marketing was be a bit easier, but this guy took to another level. You dont have to read the chapters 3 TIMES to pass, just go over the powerpoint slides on MindTap. Good luck if you have him!",0
"Literally made the course as hard as possible for NO reason at all. I beg everybody who reads this please please please do not take any class with this professor. Review sheets literally just say test will draw on information from lectures doesnt tell you what to study at all. Just save your time, money, and GPA and let anybody else teach you.",0
Overall she care about her students and she helped me understand more about college.,1
She seems to went from one extreme to the other. Last year I guess was great this year horrible. When you ask a question you are sent back to a slide. Her test are worded to confuse you. Even when she makes the mistake your grade is the one to suffer.  Unless you already know biology and need this as refresher would not suggest.,0
"!!!!!DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!! only one that fits in your schedule? Change your schedule. only one open? Wait until next semester. He puts about 50 extra words in between the answer you ask for, discourages questions, writes like a 4 year old, doesn't review, doesn't even teach what shows up on the test, and uses unknown methods. I hate this man",0
"if you like English it might be the good class for you, but trust me this teacher is Hard.  ",0
"I like your dedication because you are a supper helpful hero and an enthusiastic BUSINESS LAW 2301 ONLINE Professor at Richland College. I thank you and appreciated you so much, Professor RANDY WATERMAN . (L.V.N)Richland College Appreciation Week.",1
"Dr. Naresh is not bad but she is not great either. Typically, students get confused alot when she teaches. However, if you are already really good at math then it will be easier to understand her when she teaches. She cares but personally she does not explain concepts well because she expects you to know alot of things already and to catch on fast.",0
"Well what can I say , I honestly think he could use some lecture time . If you come to class just know that you are coming for the clicker points and that is it, there will be no lectures you are on your own in this class and the sample exam have nothing to do with the real exams given. Good luck ",0
"Super Hard grader. The pop quizzes are worth most of your final grade. At least telling students about the quizzes even one day beforehand will help. There was a pandemic going on, and I felt like the guidelines were so harsh considering the state of mind so many people were in. He doesn't think about the students and doesnt grade fairly. UGHHHH",0
His instructions are confusing.,0
"Horrible professor for PSY200. Not helpful, confusing, and boring. She isn't willing to give extra credit and her tests are impossible even if you can do the problems in class or homework. (She likes trick questions). Do yourself a favor and take someone else before you put yourself through this torture. I would of dropped the class if I could.",0
Mike is AMAZING both as a professor and a person. Lecture may not be mandatory but READ THE BOOK! The structure of class is lecture in the first hour and exercises/try-it-yourself is the second hour and it's really helpful. Exercise solutions are also posted.,1
"Presentstions are completely useless and a waste of time. Which you have one alone and one group but he is a really great guy, very smart and if you do what you have to do and study youll do great. He makes the information easily understood and LOVES discussions.",1
"He is more than clear, giving insight from real world situations and examples. If you pass the class, you will definitely have a solid understanding of the material. The tests cover the basics and you better practice plenty of problems or you will stumble. Overall, one of the best professors Ive had so far.",1
"The WORST professor I've ever taken classes with in my life. Not only does she NOT teach the material at all, she forces you to learn the class yourself through textbooks&makes significant typos on the exams. Worse with online classes, goes to breakout rooms every 2 seconds. Won't teach you the material.I would recommend you avoid her at all costs.",0
"This professor during a pandemic does not provide any extra credit that will actually move your grade up. There are only 3 exams that make up the majority of the grades and she does not curve or care. Overall the professor can't keep her personal life away from her professional work, which is a bad trait to have as a professor.",0
This class is really easy but she does not give out any grades higher than a 95. Usually you will get between an 85 and 90 on an essay no matter how much work you put into it. She is super flexibly and very nice. DO NOT GET THE TEXTBOOK OR ACCESS CODE it is not worth it. We used it once and it was not helpful and you can just say you forgot it.,1
Amazing class- material and professor- wise.,1
Dr. Meehan is one of the greatest professors I have ever had. I took History and Systems with her and she makes it extremely easy to do well as long as you carry your weight. She is understanding and if you are having a problem you just need to talk to her and she will help you. She makes it easy to pay attention and provides everything you need.,1
"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS WITH CAMP! If he is the only professor available, wait until next semester. He seems great and wonderful until after the last day of dropping the class before having to pay. On one writing I decided to try and be a good student and find the entire book of the section the reading came out of and he counted off, DONT TAKE HIM!!",0
"Professor Sherwood is the consumate professional; always willing to lend a helping hand when needed. Very responsive, and her subject knowledge is very high. I would gladly sit as one of her students in any class she teaches; she's very smart and a caring person with a great smile too! God bless you Ms. Audra! J",1
"Very interesting class, keeps the subjects very stimulating and pretty much hands you the exams beforehand so you can prepare for it...TF graded the papers a little harsh though...all in all if you're an IR major, it will seem pretty boring the first part of the semester seems irrelevant but the last quarter is the ""IR"" part of the course",1
I had a very bad experience with this class. He is very bad at lecturing. The lectures were useless because he just read the textbook word for word and barely did any practice questions that would actually help us on the quizzes. He also yelled at students everyday and was very rude to everyone. He was rude in emails and in class. Terrible prof,0
"He took way too long to grade things & never followed the syllabus. His class didn't seem to have any structure or purpose. He often arrived late. He has a tendency to come off as arrogant, rude, &condescending. I asked him roughly how many sources should we use for our paper. He said, ""I shouldn't have to tell a college student that."" Um what??",0
"Professor Lowi is an amazing professor. She really cares about her students and is very interested in their opinions. She is very learned about the Middle East and this is what makes her class so interesting. However, she assigns a LOT of readings and is a VERY hard grader.",1
"Those who can't practice, teach...BUT NOT GOOD @ THAT EITHER!!! She shrugs her shoulders when u need help, or refers u to vague study guide sheet. grades are midterm, final, project, and 5 HW's. However, the exams had questions on readings she claimed were OPTIONAL!!! Also had to completely remember an 11 part rubric by heart. 2 abs.=fail to her.",0
Dr. Sikora does not know how to teach Calculus. I have already taken Calculus in high school and the credit would not transfer to UB. He will not accept on tests the way the book explains or another equally right way. His lectures are repetitions of the reading and he is completely unorganized and hard to follow.,0
He is not very nice very insulting and makes rude comments,0
"Cannot convey ideas properly. If you ask her a question, chances are it won't be answered. Lectures and examples are not a good representation of what the class actually covers. Pray you have a good TA.",0
I can understand some of the other reviews but overall he's a pretty good professor. he gives extra credit opportunities and his curves are pretty good. The exams are okay and i would just study lecture notes.,1
This is an online class and almost everything is done on connect. The connects for the most part are easy. However the midterm and final are in person and completely ridiculous. Our midterm this semester was 12 multiple choice questions and our final was 16 multiple choice questions. No room for partial credit. Class is ridiculous.,0
"Dr. Palmer is super nice and sweet. The tests were all short answer/essay questions, but not too hard. For the first one he didn't tell us what he expected so it was a learning curve. Learn the vocab in the textbook for the quizzes! TONS of extra credit and don't miss lectures! They're on the test!!! Class is not bad, but kinda dry and a bit boring",1
This course is a complete waste of money and time. This guy has no idea what hes doing hes terrible. Professor Thompson does nothing more than read off The overhead projector its obvious he has no idea what the cost is about. Long boring lectures that have nothing to do with what youre going to be tested on sad so very sad. Take another class,0
"Honestly, one of the worst professors i have taken at UCF. She has such a sassy attitude with people its ridiculous... Waking up at 7:30 to sit through her lectures, which mind you last 3 hours is not an example of a good teacher, especially when they teach us that lecturing in front of a group of children is not the most effective method.",0
nice dude,1
HARD!! Dont do it. So hard. Thats honestly all. Hard.,0
She gives you a quiz over the chapter before you even go over it in class. This class is very hard and she tells you from the very beginning that if you don't study 20hrs. a week you wont pass. She is a fast reader and if  you don't get the notes down she doesn't really care. If this is your first Science class to take DO NOT TAKE HER! ,0
"She has absolutely no sympathy for anyone's problems. She cares only about herself and not her students. It's too bad she'll be teaching more next year, I feel bad for you people who have her in the future.",0
"What everyone else said.  Very hard, 5 hrs of homework a night.  A really good teacher willing to help you.",1
"Workload: 1-2 10 question multiple choice quizzes, 1 600-800 discussion post, and a 50-150 one question ""survey"" each week. We also had one 1200-1600 word essay but it was about our own cultural identity so very straight forward. Easy class to take in the summer since all assignments are due each Sunday. Interesting and relevant topic!",1
Not a fun class. Communication and grade posting was very poor.,0
I LOVE this prof! She has inspired an interest of anthropology! She is very interested in the material and very passionate about it. All readings were interesting. Attendance and participation are very important to her. Tests are pretty easy as long as you follow the study guide she gives you. Take this class. Very interesting!,1
"She assigns one hour documentaries for homework and 3 hour democratic debate. You get quizzed on student presentations on very tiny specific details. Instead of teaching, she shows video clips during class and prepare for it to show up on the quiz. The quizzes are easy except for when specifics questions are asked about video clips or presentations",0
"Metzl is an awesome professor! If you are looking for your R&E req., this class is great- interesting lectures/guest speakers. Some reading, but it's fairly easy. Take the honors section if you have the opportunity. Though I had no interest in women's studies before, this class used both history and current events, and made me care. GREAT class.",1
"Dr. Stephens is a great professor. An A in her class is definitely rare. As with a number of teachers, you would have to read outside of the text in addition to the text to get those few extra points. That being said, if you have read all the material in class and took good notes you can definitely get a B out of her class.",1
"He is not online class material. The professor grades hard, gives unhelpful critique, and is hardly present out of class. He gives no space for exploration or mistakes in an open-ended and nerve-wracking speech class. He fails to accommodate. He will grade you unfairly when the reality is that he cannot be bothered, and less so during COVID times.",0
"I took his 4466&4467, his teaching style is really suit for me. Especially the ppt, Simple and straight, practical and efficient. If you want to get a high grade, the key is to pass final, I got F in the middle but B-A in the final. Just notice that, deep understanding of his powerpoint. Thanks prof. Chen giving me another sight of finance.",1
"The professor is tough, but really knows her stuff. Always willing to take time outside of class to help. Great teacher.",1
He is one of the best professors. He will help you learn and is very easy going.,1
"She was so unorganized. You will learn little to nothing in her class. Papers got graded very late and not on time. Around exam time, there was no set schedule for when she missed her testing time and still did not grade papers.",0
She is my favorite professor so far! She is very understanding and really knows what she is talking about. She assigns the perfect amount of work to make sure you understand the content but isn't overbearing. I would rate her higher if I could.,1
"She is amazing. I agree with some of the negative comments because she does not like it when you disagree with her but besides that she is perfect. She is very knowledgeable and an entertaining professor. Once you understand what she likes, you will get an A no problem.",1
Really dedicated to making sure every student learns the material. Doesn't use powerpoint or hand outs but instead writes and goes through everything slowly on the white board to make sure every one understands. If you go to class and take advantage of all the resources she provides econ suddenly feels very manageable. Also gives extra credit,1
"I was excited to take this class, she has a lot of work experience and it shows in lecture. Her lectures are very boring, dry and granular. Not a very good communicator. Too strict on time limits on exams and has ripped them out of my hands several times. Putative, obtuse and very short on empathy. Not sure what her motivations are for teaching.",0
"She berates anyone who gives an incorrect answer to an excessively vague question and when no one answers she gets even more irritable, has confusing grading requirements, and holds students responsible for her own mistakes. If the whole class doesn't do well on a portion of an exam it's never her fault for poor teaching but ours for not listening.",0
"Dr. V is a good teacher but expects you to work very hard. Her tests are extremely hard and remember to study alot  for them. Attend her review sessions and complete the study guides. You will not receive an A if you don't put in the time. Online homework, quizzes and participation points are only other grades besides tests. Overall great teacher!!",1
"Good teacher.  Read his notes online and thenotes you take it class and you will do good :) Dont bother on buying a book, you won't open it once...",1
"Very enthusiastic, funny, well-informed, and pretty",1
Professional and sociable. He's great.,1
I did not enjoy taking her. She was confusing in her lectures and assigned way to much work. I never understood an assignment and always had to look up what she supposedly taught us. I do not recommend. ,0
"Cast is a very vague and inconsistant proffesor.  I stuggled with his class, but went to his office hours.  He was very rude to me and did not help me at all.  I was able to recieve a B in the class, but it was a struggle.  I would recommend a better professor, or at least one that's willing to help you if bio isn't your thing.",0
Beyond boring! she is so unorganized and that stresses you out so much. Worst class ever !,0
"This class will impact so much! You will come back to see her after you are done with it. She is an amazing teacher, and helps you become a great writer and a great disciple of Christ!",1
she is funny n smart n a sweetie,1
The most enthusiastic professor I've ever have; and he really knows his subject.,1
"Pretty Hard. Lectures aren't that helpful, but they're not useless either. Homeworks will take at least 1-2 hours. Tests are really hard and not enough time was given. Not many things are graded, so it's hard to end with a good grade. I messed up on the first few hws, which led me to fail the class. I wish there were another prof to retake it with.",0
Great teacher very kind and understanding unfortunately due to how this math is set up on computer i am not doing so great but i think if he would teach the class instead of the computer he would be amazing!,1
"Great class, very interestng, and Rothstein is very informative",1
"Doctor Weiner is a very tough teacher to have for such a tough class. More than half of my class dropped the class before it even hit half the semester. I had a huge issue with him and that's why I dropped. He screamed at me in front of the whole class and didn't even let me explain what happened. After that, he constantly brought it up.",0
This is the one class that literally helps me relax. I thought I'd hate it since it has nothing to do with my major but he completely changed my view. His lectures are simple but keeps your attention and his tests are easy as long as you pay attention. I loved everything about this class. The professor is always ready to help and he's very sweet.,1
Most boring professor at the university.  Totally unsympathetic to student concerns.,0
"This class requires you to work, but it was also the only class that I actually learned something in. If you care enough to get the grade you want, it's definitely attainable. Just make sure you read the textbook and do the homework and mini quizzes (in lab) correctly because they do add up. Also pay attention to details.",1
"He makes mistakes frequently during lecture. Both quizzes so far, I had to have re-graded as I saw mistakes in their grading. He goes throw material way to quickly. He uses acronyms with out explaining what they mean. I am going back for my 2nd bachelors, and this is by far the worst teacher I have ever had.",0
"This teacher was one of the worst teachers I've had in my experience in college. Honestly, this class discusses no political ideas that are contemporary in the slightest, and your opinion almost always gets denied. Your opinion is generally irrelevant to someone else's opinion, the papers are way too much and convoluted.",0
Lombardi is such a sweet lady. Her classes are really long and boring. But she doesn't mind if you don't pay attention as long as you show up. She gives study guides for the tests that are exactly the same as the test. Just look over the study guide a few times. Would take her class again. Easy A,1
I LOVE HER. She is amazing in class and is very organized. She is also a great adviser.,1
"She does not look at the students when she lectures. As a professor, she is not specific. She reads off of PowerPoint slides, and without them, there would not be much she can say to the class. I feel very drained in this class because she teaches in a very unenthusiastic manner. This is one of the worst classes I have ever taken in my life.",0
"Love this guy. Take any class he teaches, trust me you won't be sorry.",1
Falola's class is really boring. His accent makes him difficult to understand and most of the lectures seem to be the same thing said in different ways. His TAs do all the grading and are really annoying. Attendance is mandatory but everyone just scrolls through FB during class. Really hard to be motivated to do the readings. Would not recommend.,0
"Amazing! His personality is hilarious, and he wants the best for all his students. His exams are examples straight from the book, as long as you do the homework and examples it's an easy A/B. His lectures are basically the easiest examples from the book, but his exams are a fair reflection of the lectures.",1
I really enjoyed being in Professor Rubin's class. She has so much experience in the field and offers lots of knowledge. She is very caring in her own way and was supportive.,1
"Sigal's exams are very tough, don't take her class. Her husband (math prof David Earn) is really hot :)",0
He's an awesome professor. The course isn't a walk in the park and it's pretty term heavy but that's geology and he's always willing to help you with anything. He even emailed me articles to look at for a final paper for my SOC class. He really cares about making the material relevant to our lives. Definitely want him for GEO classes in my future!,1
"Took her for civic engagement. Great class, and I'm a business major. Not too hard, but you have to listen well in class and take good notes; no need to read the book! Civic engagement is a lot of fun, you get to volunteer at a hospital or other med institution.",1
hate this class. she made the experience of learning about children boring and in fact made me want to switch my major.,0
A teacher? I would say more like a textbook reader...  If you want to learn something do not take his class. He would read directly out of the textbook for an entire class period.  Easy A but he is one of the most unclear and boring teachers I have ever met. If you care about learning avoid at all costs!!!! Go buy the textbook and save your time!!!,0
"Mr. Henson is the fricking BEST! He is always willing to answer any question outside of class. He doesn't really give any homework, but you have to study hard for tests! And he offers EXTRA credit!",1
It is time that other Professor teaches something good in this Campus. I had him twice and I have not learned that much. He will do a very basic work. If you are trying to learn something you need to take another one.,0
"Mr. Prey was an amazing teacher and I loved taking his class. It was one of the more challenging classes I've taken, but I did learn a lot. He is very good at telling stories and making lectures interesting and I would take his class again in a heart beat.",1
He was nice at first but he clearly wants there to be a hierarchy of grades in his class. It's like he doesn't want to give out A's to people that log on for class every day and TRY. He's rude & queeny and sometimes he makes offensive & shady remarks. His grading is very nit picky and he loves giving you a borderline grade. Take with someone else!,0
"Dear Black Students, DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE. Unless you want to sit in a 3 hr night class and listen to your classmates demean us. If you can handle that then its a super easy A. But if youd like to keep your peace of mind. STEER CLEAR. Discusses black topics. Without the discussion. Great for your gpa, horrible for your mental stability.",0
"Dr. Mac makes classes fun. Hes a ""I don't give a crap"" teacher. That however can turn bad. His tests are SUPER HARD! It very easy to fail and fall behind in his class. The only extra credit is Socrates contest and that it. Don't ask him for any. ",1
"2/2 (Only to find out on the day of presenting that sharing our ideas was optional). And lastly, has ignored every single one of my emails. So for those who are in the film program and want a laid-back professor, then take his classes. But for those who want to learn and have a better experience, then youre better off picking someone else.",0
The professor is basically a live textbook (in a good way). If you don't like watching someone solve math problems though you can just read the textbook. Only part that really sucked was the TA. He's super harsh and mis-graded my homework several times.,1
Sure there's a lot of reading and the papers take forever to write. It could always be worse and how else would he be able to test students in this class? Have them read a bunch of research papers and give them a multiple choice questions? He's not a hard grader and is very professional and caring. Overall it's an easy A if you do the work,1
"*Sighs* I took this class because it was supposed to be fun and easier. This is the most ridiculous ""class"" I have ever taken. The quizzes and exams are literally impossible no matter how you prepare yourself. I could not believe my scores, I am an A student and this class will certainly affect my GPA. Stay away @ all costs!!",0
"Mary Layoun is a very nice person. Its nice that participation is 30% of grade but lectures are just painful. She will talk about ""trying to get people to talk about difficult topics"", then turn around and make offensive asides in lecture. TA's grade your 3 papers, and they are really strict. If you're not a lit major, then I wouldn't recommend. ",0
He's is a really nice guy but his class is way too hard. The quizzes are doable but his tests are impossible if you are not a naturally born history person. I was a 4.0 student in high school and ended up with a C in the class (my only C). Avoid his class if possible but if you must take his class DO ALL THE EXTRA CREDIT OPPORTUNITIES.,0
"Honestly, this is one of the best professors here in Cal State Long Beach. no idea why people are saying bad things about this professor. Yes, he makes the class difficult, really difficult. But his explanations are always accurate and concise. If you want to pass, you have to study before lecture; considering 229 is an abstract class. 326 is fun!",1
"He's easy just take him, nice guy too...",1
"Prof. Bucklin is loud, vulgar, can be offensive but also sometimes funny. The class is relatively easy if you show up but she has quizzes that are hard. She also gives assignments and then takes 3 months to give you one grade back. The class feels like a waste of time because I don't pay attention but I still have a decent grade",0
This course has been the most difficult class Ive ever taken However max is funny and caring prof even though he doesnt look it The labs in this course were BRUTAL and the midterm was equally bad(46% Ave after curve) the exams need to be more fair he should also consider gives us a heads up on what is explicitly gonna be tested.,0
"This professor is an excellent teacher. Her classes are always fun and information filled. The criticisms so far are completely unjustified. I had and excellent time learning from her, as she was very clear. Rough start, but flawless victory in the end. Her class is very informative with great use of time. She is new, but has a lot of potential!",1
"awful prof, im so glad my class with him is over and i never have to do another with him ever again, I've never had a prof as bad as him",0
"Unable to answer basic questions, and refuses to answer homework questions. Tests on things that weren't taught and encourages students to drop the course. Doesn't hand tests back and gives no feedback. Threatens to send anyone who questions him to the Dean. Literally told the class ""it's the professor's job to make you feel bad.""",0
She is ok I guess but gives different review than actual test,0
She is literally the sweetest! She really cares about her student's success and during quarantine she would so many times extend the due date for assignments! She gives good feed back and her lecture videos are very informational and clear. She gives a lot of chances for extra credit which is nice. I wish she taught SPAN 1103 as well:/,1
"Great teacher makes everyone feel comfortable when it comes to presenting, she helps you a lot and gives a lot of feedback the only way to dial her class is if you don't do anything at all.",1
We don't know 1/2 of our grades and never hands back assignments!  Last exam covered calculations and material we didn't even get taught how to do! How am I supposed to fill in a chart of calculations when we were not taught how to do them in class?  He is a joke and so disorganized.  Do not take this prof--run away--it is a semester of nightmares,0
Syllabus is very clear on what is due and when. He lists what he is grading you on in each assignment. Happy to answer any questions you have. Organized and straight forward. This class was very basic and easy to pass. Just show up and do the homework on time.,1
"Hertz was a mixed bag. He was easy on one hand as he literally lays out what's needed for his papers. But then again his grading criteria is very tedious. In terms of feedback, he really doesn't offer you that much info on what is necessarily wrong with your paper. He also goes off topic at points. Not bad, but if you could take someone else, do it",1
I had to retake this class and this professor made it very easy for the class to pass because he provides sample exams that are just like the exams. I regret not taking him the first time I took this class. He is better than any other.,1
She is amazing. She is so thorough in all her notes. She gets all the points across. Have to attend all her classes through. Missing a day will hurt you.,1
The class is hard. Read the book and don't get behind. His tests require a lot of writing and understanding of the material. He is the only E350 prof so you might as well do well the first time.,0
really good professor. enjoyed his class,1
If you are quiet in class you will be forced to an online class with mandatory C grades for all in class assignments. Ever heard of the saying the customer is always right? Cool in this case the teacher is God and youd do best to follow his commandments or else...,0
"I never really struggled with the content in this class, so I cant exactly say what a struggling student would experience with this prof. However, she seemed very willing to help her students. She always responded promptly to emails she sent, and she gave partial credit on exams/quizzes also. If you have an A or B, you can exempt the final.",1
"This class was way harder than expected. The exams are really hard even though you get a cheat sheet. Class attendance isn't part of your grade but if you skip you'll miss a bunch of in class assignments and quizzes. He says he doesn't care if you come to class but he really does. The homework is pretty time consuming, and doesn't relate to exams.",0
"Dr. Zbeida is one of my favorite professors! I took her for comp 1, and now am in her comp 2 class. She gives amazing feedback and really wants her students to improve and do their best. We had a couple of papers and lots of group assignments that were completion grades. This is a fairly easy class, but I recommend her for her dedication and help!",1
"I would also like to quickly note that he is not visually appealing and i do not know why previous students made that comment. He is a 50-some year old italian man with long stringy hair and some hard-core italian facial features and good style. He's not hideous, but he's not as hot as everyone on this page seems to think he is.",0
"Mr. Pentek is a great teacher, some think he comes off condensing but its just his dry humor. He is a caring teacher, but he wants to make sure you know the material. The material is very hard and he tries to go in depth as best as possible. He is one of the toughest teachers but hes worth it. FYI know the Wiggers Diagram like the back of your hand",1
"Assignments are terrible, book is horrible, exams are, complicated. This class was heavily reliant on lots and lots and lots of reading and researching. It doesn't seem like much thought went into the assignments. I hate to rate it this way because I chose this class because I only saw good things about her, but for whatever reason the coursesucked",0
"He is a very nice man. Helps with proofreading papers more than any other professor I've ever had. As long as you participate in class, always come to class, and meet with him to discuss and revise your papers (3), you should do well.",1
Readings are from 10-40 pages in a span of two days. Dr. A is great but this class is about colonialism/imperialism so you might not get the teaching you desire about feminism. I will say she is very understanding of her students & is there for them. I appreciate her watering down the final for us considering that were in a pandemic. Okay course.,1
"This class is relatively easy, but it is frustrating and annoying. The program used and format of the class is completely inefficient and not at all user-friendly.  Rankin is not helpful and cannot even do the activities herself many times. Her teaching is immature and ineffective. I would suggest finding a better professor for this class.",0
"Worst professor I've ever taken ever in my history of math professors. She is an introvert, which I did take into factor, but she cannot teach the subject whatsoever. Skims through the guided notes, if she doesn't like a part of the notes she skips it and her tests are worded so you cant understand them. Don't take unless you want to teach urself.",0
Not a very helpful professor... but not horrible. There certainly are worse professors. I feel neutral or indifferent toward the class and professor.,0
"She has an accent which can be a little tricky to understand. Goes over material very fast. Expects you to spend a ton of time outside of class to read and study. Occasional pop quizzes. Much of grade is from exams. I would highly suggest a different professor. She is however pretty caring, though that doesn't make up for how the class is taught.",0
"Wonderful teacher! She takes attendance, but you have 4 skips. There is homework every night, but takes less than 20 minutes to do. She gives a lot of partial credit, which really helps your grade. Tests are pretty easy as long as you study. She was very friendly and lectures were very active and not boring.",1
I love his class! Very into the discussions and actually knows what he is talking about. He is a great advisor too. I have his night class and I don't even mind it. Take him whenever you get the chance.,1
"I loved this class! I learned alot about the real world and the law. What he says is true, its experience talking. I'll tell you a secret. Mention food in class and he may proably dismiss early (depends if hes hungry enough).",1
"He is a wonderful Professor. I am not saying this because I passed but because he really takes the time to help you understand math. He shows different techniques to solving a problem in case you don't understand. He's awesome! Offers extra credit. Do the work, study and you'll pass. You can't expect to pass if you don't do the work.",1
"The only thing you need is the access code, didn't use the textbook. Attendance is not mandatory. I only went to class for a month and stopped. Everything is online aka, assignments and exams. If you go to class the day before and exam she'll tell you what's on the exam There is a research paper but it's for participation. Easy A. Would take again.",0
"love love love Labelle. Amazing professor. Lectures are inspirational and actually teach. Exams are straight forward, and study guides are provided. Will offer feedback on assignments. REALLY understands her subject research. Very smart professor and love attending her class. Definitely will take her in the future. ",1
"This class was awful! Professor Martin is not clear when speaking to the class, the whole semester no one knew what was going on. She is an extremely tough grader on essays and takes forever to give grades back. We are currently on our 3rd essay and barely got back our grades from our first essay. Lastly she does cancel class a lot.",0
He has no remorse. Doesn't teach anything. He just pre-records lectures and makes you watch them on your own time. Every class you have a quiz first thing and then he asks you if you have any questions on the new topic you were suppose to watch for the week. Simply you have to teach yourself calculus 2 while he watches you struggle.,0
"Of the four teachers I had this past semester when all my classes went online, she was easily the best at using zoom and canvas to put class stuff online so students could still access it and her. Def not an easy A but not unreasonable either. She was super flexible about deadlines and stuff because of the coronavirus outbreak which helped.",1
This has been the worst class ever. Spent countless hours studying and doing his homework. Do not do not take this class if you are not a music major! He loads you with sooooooooo much homework its just busy work and so hard to understand. I usually get As in all my course work and have never struggled in a class so bad.,0
"Tests are super hard, but if you go to class and she knows your name, she will help you out. She's always willing to meet outside of class and explain things to you. Her accent can be tough to understand, but she is SO EXCITED about teaching multi. Her knowledge of math is like way beyond multi, so sometimes she forgets how to explain things simply",1
"Class was a piece of cake. First midterm was the easiest, and second midterm & final were not that bad since there were no tricky problems & questions. Nice teacher, but does over explain things. She is cute though!",1
"Attendance is not mandatory, but it will be very difficult to pass if you don't go. He always makes himself available to students for help outside of office hours. It is important to him that you understand the basics. Everything stems from them.",1
"This was an amazing class. Taking notes is essential, but Mr. Wells makes it easy and interesting to pay attention to lectures.",1
"Janak Joshi is an okay professor. He lectures way too much on one problem. He does this often. There is a quiz in class every Thursday (if class is T/Th), and he usually will send an email a day or two before of what you have to study. There are 2 tests + a final in class. Homework is very reasonable, and you get plenty of time to complete it.",1
Nice guy but you won't hear from him. His class is self-paced for everything is due at the end. You have two weekly assignments then 3 tests. These assignments are one discussion then one just 2-3 paragraph response paper. His tests are open-note and not time limit for you have to write paragraphs. Very easy class where he wants you to enjoy it.,1
Very little correlation between lectures and exams. He is very bad iat explaining topics and overall a very bad teacher.,0
AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LITERALLY HEAVEN SENT. the caps isn't an error.,1
Awful grader. Even if you got every answer right she can still take points off  for millions of reasons. She made a lot of mistakes in class but she wants you to be accurate as a machine in the meantime. In order to get a perfect score you have to split hairs on every question even if it has nothing to do with math.,0
He is approachable.,0
"He lectures very fast and always ends up off subject. if you want to be able to read what he's writing on the board, sit in the front. If you can teach yourself, this is your class. If you do the homework you will understand everything but the test and quizzes are the only things he takes for grades so you have to do well on those.",0
"Really disorganized, although he tries really hard.",0
The class was boring if you dont like the course. He is boring. Class is mandatory. Gives you a week to turn everything in. Not that bad. Just boring. I passed with an A.,0
"Great Teacher! She loves to answer your questions, will help you as much as she can to understand. She does a review and gives you the chance to earn extra credit before each test. I'm not the best in math and always was the type to need extra help! Took class in the summer along with a support class. Answers calls/texts fast outside class hours.",1
We had 12 Quizzes and 7 Mid-Terms in the class. His lectures are him doing 1/2 of a problem and then your homework is to finish the problem and then another 10-11 problems. No way to study for quizzes. If you like teaching yourself on a subject that can't be found on youtube? This class is for you!,0
"Very intelligent, nice guy. However, this class was such a colossal waste of my time I wish I had never taken it from him. His disorganization cost my GPA and has left a bad taste in my mouth in regards to Ecology..",0
I don't recommend taking her class because she is not an organized person. She has no idea how to use canvas and never writes anything down so it's hard to know what the main points of the lectures are. But the worst part is she never goes over any material that is taught or readings so you have no idea what you are going to be tested on.,0
This professor is not good! She wants everyone to rate her the best on here. Like who does that she just isn't good at all. I wouldn't take her if I were you.,0
"Falola is a nice guy and his lectures are funny, but how you do in the class depends on your TA. I took him my freshman year and had a nice TA and got an easy A with no effort. This year I took him again and got a jerk TA who is giving me a low B. Lectures are off topic and you don't really need to pay attention to pass just read the textbook.",0
HOnestly I have taken manuy online classes and have a GOA of 3.74 before before I took this professors class. She is hard to please if you get a bad grade and you question her she will give you details but when you apply her notes to the next assignments she will just add more issues. This professor is seriously the worst professor ever. STAY AWAY!,0
Better than most of the high school teachers i had!,1
"He is so confusing the way he teaches class! A lot of reviews say he's scatterbrained; that is completely true. He assumes you know everything he talks about & unless you ask questions, he doesn't really address things you want to know. Assumes you know everything & relies on you reading to learn, he doesn't have lesson plans. I don't recommend.",0
"So sweet! Honestly too good for this world. A very curious professor, so do your best to participate in discussion. Approachable.",1
"Great teacher, helped me understand it all.",1
She is unable to talk and write at the same time and will often do the problem wrong completely. When she does speak she usually has her hand by her mouth or mumbles. Most of the time when you ask her a question she will stare at you with a blank face and then say something unrelated. The study guides don't relate to the tests whatsoever.,0
"Fran is one of the best teachers in the WORLLDD. I love her so much even though I am terrible at Chem and found the class to be challenging. Tip: her lectures are always more helpful than the book. Also best way to study for her exams are by doing practice problems (I learned this the hard way). Shes sooo CARINGGG almost like a mother :,)",1
"Excellent Professor. Lectures are solid and to the point. She entertains hypothetical and ""silly"" questions gracefully. DO THE READING! Otherwise you will be lost. Clausen won't make you look bad if you don't (others will) but you will get left behind. Your fault not hers. Definitly want her again for other classes!",1
"Feedback on papers was on punctuation mainly, not content. We were writing proof arguments and I never really got feedback on my arguments, if they were weak, strong, well worded, etc. Also, the video put out for each lesson just went over the links in the lesson and showing us those, no insights in how to approach the lesson.",0
"Dr. Hadavas is a great professor. His lectures are clear, and he is helpful if you are having trouble. Homework is a must! If you do not do the homework you will not make a good grade. The tests are very similar to the homework problems, so if you get the homework problems correct, chances are you will make an A on the exam. I would take him again!",1
"Professor Gill definitely makes you do more work than any other professor that offers this course. Offers some extra credit opportunities but the bottom line is that if you take her you have to struggle to get a B, where if you take anybody else you can coast by with an A. Only saying this from a STEM major standpoint and this course is required.",0
"I have taken this professor for ENC 1101 and 1102. I would do it again if I could. He is very interesting and clear about what he expects. If you have a problem or question, he makes himself available whether it's meeting during office hours or through email. I have a lot of respect for him and I am glad I took his class.",1
"Alyce was an amazing professor, especially when you are taking a course online.  She was caring and compassionate.  She gave great feedback and in lieu of test for our midterm, we did a group project.  Working collaboratively helped tremendously and really connected people in the class.  I highly reccommend her!!!",1
"8 weeks are usually loaded with tons of work but this one is pretty easy. 4 essays, no midterm or final. Lectures are boring but make it enjoyable for 3hrs. I would highly recommend taking her if you want an easy class in English.",1
Worse class ever!!! Thank GOD for the grad TA!! Stanton doesn't care about anything except using class as an experiment!! AVOID THIS CLASS!! Sooo much work!!,0
tough grader but worth it. as long as you pay attention use your book and do the work you'll do fine. DON'T BE LATE TO LAB EVER. very funny and HELPS you UNDERSTAND chemistry. great teacher overall,1
"Mr. MacCabe is a knowledgeable person and knows how to teach. He likes to teach and help his students understand well. The class is long, but he makes the students learning enjoyable. Students who do all homework will not worry about the exams. The exams don't impact much on the final grade.",1
Professor Nguyen was fantastic. He even gave you the discussion topic if you emailed him nicely.,1
Amazing teacher.She is smart and always helpful.,1
"Dr. Hale lets students discover things themselves by talking it out. He doesn't teach in order to preach his own opinions but to help students gain their own insights. He may not be an expert like some other professors on specific texts, but getting to actually discuss in class is possible because he keeps his comments to a minimum. He's kind, too.",1
really nice...well spoken  good sense of humor and sense of how to help his students. very approachable.,1
"I had no idea about astronomy before this class. I have come to find that my perspective on the universe and reality was incredibly flawed. This class was great and you will learn a bunch of cool stuff from a guy who really knows his sh**, he works for NASA for God sakes! He wears the coolest(nerdiest) shirts abd hes very approachable. Take it!",1
"Dr. Wingender is very fun! He is like everyone's grandfather. He has the best intentions, and teaches you things for the real world! He does call on you at random, so you must be focused. The tests are like the practice tests and come from information in the lectures, so you have to go to class. You will learn a lot for outside of college!",1
She is the hardest professor I have ever had. Friends at large universities ask me why this professor is so hard on us at a community college. I have asked her for help over e-mail and a couple times she did not bother to read what I asked and responded rudely without helping me with a personal question about an assignment.,0
"In this class I read an ""article"" of sorts and review a power point twice a week. The power point was super helpful and I probably wouldn't have done well without it. If you put in the work and turn things in on time you should get a good grade.",1
"Professor Shields is one of the most sweetest professors that I know. Hes a person that you could approach , you don't need a book for the course, and the documentary films are very interesting to watch. The only issue is had was staying up!",1
"Don't be scared off. She is harsh in her marking but if you ask for her help, she will be more than willing. Her words might feel a little sharp but all she wants is for students to be ready for the harder parts of ASL. Even with online learning, she had clear and easy lectures to follow (not long). She listens to student feedback, don't be afraid.",1
"I took Schultz for a ""D"" semester. By the 6th week of a 8 week course, she has only graded one paper out of 5. Also, she has knocked one week off the course making it 7 weeks (The final was due on the 12/6 and now is due 11/30). All of this would be fine if she gave more feed back, since she does not though, knowing your grade is a guessing game.",0
"He is one of the worst teachers at the school to take math with. He is not helpful at all the way he grades is tough. If you don't do it his way then he marks it wrong, even if you have the right answer . This was the only class i didn't pass this semester I got all B's in my other classes.",0
Professor Levine was the best professor I had so far in my college curriculum. There were 3 books assigned for us. To be honest you can just read the summary of those books online and you will be more than good. Very down to earth guy. No Hw just 3 exams. The exams are very similar to what he teaches in class.,1
"He is a pretty good teacher, especially for someone exclusively online",1
"He knows a lot about his subject and has interesting lectures. Old way of teaching, he lacks pedagogy. I got lost in a sea of information. The process of how to write an essay was confusing. If you are a visual learner like me you will be lost. There are no charts, drawings, pictures, audio or movements to support learning. Just disorganized text.",1
"Bronie is so sweet and she is always so jovial. She is great at lecturing and her tests are challenging but not impossible. I think she has less homework than most math 31 professors, but there is still a lot (not her fault though). Her final is fairly easy too. There is multiple extra credit possibilities, so do take advantage of that!",1
I took her 0314/1314 class this semester. Her teaching methods are hard to understand because she would teach the long way for problems. She teaches you 4-5 chapters every class period and then wed have a test the following week. She provides notes for the lecture and does go over the test review. Shes a nice lady but I would not take her again.,0
"If I had the option to describe this class in one word... it would be HORRIBLE. Tests are super hard, attendance is MANDATORY so if you miss three or more times, you're down to an 80% for attendance. She is not helpful and gives horrible lectures. I would NOT recommend her whatsoever. Save yourself and do NOT take the course with her",0
Really confusing.,1
really boring subject matter but he tries his best to make it interesting. extreamly easy to do well in class and if you do well you can write the final which is open book. he definelty deserves kudos for being at unb for this long!,1
"I do not look forward to class with her at all. Yes, she's nice, sweet, and the classic absent minded teacher. HOWEVER, that does not exclude her bland teaching meathods. I am constantly yawning in her class, and it's on a subject I like! She's nice to talk to when a paper's due, but sucked the fun out of the seminar.",0
RUN!! Super hard exams for non-accounting students. Only covers 1-2 exercises in the review similar to the 12-15 in the tests. the fact that is fully on-line makes it so much more difficult. Do all the homework and you'll barely pass the class with some minimal luck in the tests.,0
I thought I would hate this class (dry subject) but Stewart does a great job of making things clear and understandable. Easily the best I've had at WU and now I'll major!,1
"He isn't great at explaining things, he's a tough grader, yet does't give any structure to the assignment. I really hated his class, along with almost everyone who took him. His lectures are short, but they seem super long because of how boring they are. Would not recommend.",0
Professor Mock its a great passionate teacher of history. Good at helping students with what ever question. Takes his time and give plenty of examples.,1
"I've never had a more BORING instructor, let alone subject.  For an online student there's next to no interaction and reply and grading times are horrible.",0
"Such an amazing professor, hands down! She covers a lot of material but all of it is interesting. There are two papers, midterm and final. Gives extra credit! Take her and you will not regret it. Easy A!",1
His notes can be confusing. You have to read the book to help get an understanding of the topics. Can't use calculator on tests. Best to try to get a hold of his old tests to help study for the tests. He does curve on the grades.,0
I wish didn't have to take this class. I felt like I drew the same trees for most of the semester and it bored me to tears. I suck at art & I still wished we did something more challenging. Most of the projects are geared toward 3-d for 1/2 of the semester(??) He's nice but you do not leave feeling you learned anything.,0
"Avoid taking any class with him! I mean it. He left very mean comment on my project, and I got the lowest grade in the whole college span from nowhere because the contents are actually quite easy for me. Poor lecturer who assigns tedious and useless HW, taking his class wastes your time because you never know what those theories mean. ",0
"Stay away! writes on the board faster than you can write and finishes a problem before you while you are copying.  She gets aggravated when you dont grasp concepts.  Uses MathXL for all homeworks, but doesnt always teach everything that is on it.  She will make you want to cry.",0
"Dr. Feagin Is THE BEST professor at GHC. Her online class is a breeze, the tests are word for word what the study guide is, and she is always available to help her students. 10/10 would take again!",1
"This class was the hardest one I have ever taken, it was supposed to be easy but the way he does his lectures is confusing, I am an Architecture major student and for me all the words sounded like a foreign language, he gets distracted very easily with current topics and tht in my opinion killed the lecture. Not recomended if not Bussiness major.",0
"One of the worst professors I've ever had. The class has no organization and she doesn't actually teach. It's supposed to be a graduate-level literature class, but she knows nothing about literature. She just uses the class to push her own political ideologies on her students, and gets angry if your opinion differs from hers.",0
"this teacher thinks you check u email once a hour and when student made tiny mistake, she just give you a 0, the worse teacher i ever had.",0
"Great professor, grades fair and has great knowledge in her area. Prof Kim is also great and understanding on assignments. You will def learn alot in her class",1
He's really helpful if your willing to learn. If your not understanding what he's trying to teach he will figure out a way to help you understand it.,1
"Tests are unreasonably hard.  Her lectures are fast and unorganized, the only people who can follow them are people who have taken Calculus and are really good at math.  She doesn't really answer questions, she just says it's easy and we should know it.  Do the online homework before the exams!!!  She does give lots of extra credit.",0
"He's going to try to scare you like he's this tough professor in this not so easy to pass course but its all a front. He wants you to pass and as long as you put some sort of effort into the class and ask him questions from time to time, he WILL pass you. Talks about himself a lot but he's very caring and intelligent. You'll learn a lot.",1
Worst math prof I've had. Not clear in explaining the how to during lectures. Doesn't give enough time in class to work on new material and ask questions. Had to teach myself at home. Uses mathxl. YOU DONT KNOW YOUR GRADE THE ENTIRE SEMESTER AND HE WONT TELL YOU. He tells us how to calculate it but won't help or verify if it's correct.,0
"Such a terrible class. Never learned a thing. Memorized his study guides and did OK on his tests. He will not help you and will tell you to ask other studnets in the class. The only time you receive 100 on the ""drawings"" is when he is super busy. Other than that enjoy getting a 9.0 or and 8.5 on lab drawings.",0
I thought that this class was going to be very easy but some of the assignments we did were difficult. All of the assignments are done online and if your answer is slightly off you wont get any credit. I also didn't think she was very helpful especially during finals. An A is for sure achievable if you put in enough effort.,0
Blah. This class held so much promise yet it was totally uncaptivating and I hardly got anything out of it. I think 99.9% of the class was asleep at any given time. So many examples were presented for a single concept it was hard to keep them all straight. The seminar saved this class; it was a fair amount of work and useful.,0
"she is really good professor! she explains very easy, a lot of examples, fun class, mandatory attended. You have great time in class. ",1
I loved Professor Okada! Hes so kind and very nice to everyone. Ive attended every lecture and every homework and exam grade I got A. Some parts of his lecture is kinda tuff to understand but as long as you keep up with the homeworks you are fine! Professor Okada makes sure you understand as well always wiling to let questions asked in the open.,1
The instructor was out of touch with how online students work and did not provide clear guidance as to what was required and when it was required. There was a lack of responsiveness to issues and a tendency to blame his insufficiency and lack of communication on the students.,0
"prof. Hartman is one of the best professor I've ever met. He's really inspirational, gives a great feedback and always help you. Take a class with him: you will learn a lot, especially on how to think.",1
Whoa! Dis man be da best teacher i ever done have. Can't say nuff good tings bout dis good sir. He be forever my favorite. He is be a famous man too and not just to me's. I's evens passed his class so dat is a darn good ting also's.,1
"Never will understand his lectures. He is the worst prof tbh, never take his courses",0
This professor is TERRIBLE.  It's one of those classes where you have to teach yourself.  The class is unorganized & lectures are extremely boring.  Oh and don't plan on getting an A+ in this class....I had a 98% and he only gave me an A.  I emailed him about it and he said that he only gives out A+'s to students who get 100% or more in his class.,0
"My main problem I had with Sammy was his classes. Reads directly off the slides and if you can't write as fast as he talks, you'll just not have that information. He posts his notes no where because he doesn't want them ""stolen."" STUDY FOR THE TESTS! One bad grade on those it's hard to recover without acing the rest.",0
He's a super thorough professor! Lectures are intriguing as he always has fresh takes for each reading and points out details you probably missed while reading. Definitely do not skip and make sure you pay attention. He's a bit deadpan but funny when he wants to be,1
"Spearman is cynical, hilarious, and you can tell she genuinely loves teaching. Class discussions are great and funny. The only thing I didn't like about her is she never put a single grade into Moodle before the final, and when I emailed her asking what my grade was she never answered. Other than that, an interesting woman who knows her stuff.",1
"Amazing, cheerful and a professor who cares about you. She gives great feedback especially in your writing and makes the class fun. The script analysis class has at least 4 plays in a semester (not a lot really) plus papers for the play (fun to do if you actually listen) and she will help you if you struggle. Great grader. Well respected.",1
"If you disagree with him, you're wrong. If you have to take a philosophy class find a different professor. He's boring and loves the sound of his own voice.",0
Prof. Brandt asks a lot of questions that make you think and loves to have discussions with his students. He is also super helpful. He is really funny and sarcastic. Lots to read but he gives explanations for everything and helps you understand readings. Make sure you ask him to explain his notes on your papers cuz they're essential to your grade.,1
"He is the best!  You'll probably hate him in the beginning, but after the first half of chem110 he turns into such a nice guy!  I was having problems understanding some of the material in che111, and he actually offered to sit down with me and help me understand the material.  He saved my semester!  Sometimes he grades really hard though...",1
"All you have to do is pay attention, do your readings, and participate in discussion and you will be fine. He is always willing to help, and keeps class interesting. He thoroughly explains the assignments so that you can have a clear understanding. He's great.",1
"Very simple class. Only homework is online quizzes which are fairly easy. Grading is pretty much the tests. Ace a tests, get an A.",1
Take a class from her at your own risk.  She is very confusing and hard to learn from.  You will be learning everything on your own.  She is unwilling to help students.  Also her test are written in a very confusing style.  I would say try and find another instructor if you can.,0
"Suzan Tessier is a good online teacher. She sets a clear grading criteria for discussion posts and homework assignments. The amount of assignments she gives is not overwhelming (Meaning, you will still have a life). She is not a STRICT grader but being lazy with grammar or engagement with activities can affect your grade.",1
He is a very very tough grader. You need to figure out what he wants. Even if you ask him he will say the same thing over and over again until you basically give up and just do what you understood. Horrible at giving directions on papers. He never gives As. If you get a B+ in some of the papers you are lucky. DO NOT TAKE HIM. KILLS YOUR GPA.,0
"You'd suppose having a great experience meeting your professor just like the rest but she is Rude! If she is bothered by people coming to office i dont understand why hours are posted ... This is wrong because if there's something she could help in, it pushes you away",0
"he is the best teacher in SMU, I strongly recommand the best student to choose his class.",0
"Good teacher for an online class with the exception that she was often short in her emails and seemed to. It always read them correctly when she would reply with a completely irrelevant answer. However, she was very helpful and did repost quickly. Truly cares about students grades. Assigns alot of homework but it is easy and provides a lot of bonus",1
"Very smart man, but his teaching style wasn't for me. Very strict and assigns a lot of work. You can't miss more than 3 classes or you fail. He is very passionate about Spanish and will help you, but I did feel like he could be rude to some of the students in our class. I probably won't take him again if I can.",0
"My favorite professor so far. He was very helpful, and his class was fairly easy. There were I think 4 or 5 essays,  and as long as you try, you should get a good grade.",1
"very fun class! i enjoyed it! all you do is pay attention, take notes as you watch movies and you will pass guaranteed. Has 4 essays, presentation, 1 midterm, final. No hw! i recommend this class for anyone who enjoys films and need an easy A. Very nice prof and knows a lot about the subject. I actually learned a lot in this class.",1
"Mrs. Johnson is an excellent teacher! She expects you to behave like adults, but she is very reasonable and fair. Tests are not difficult if you show up and take notes. She makes the subject very interesting! Great class!",1
Terrible lecture class. Seemed like she was just putting a check in the box. Rushed through power points with no interest to go slow enough for note taking.,0
"This professor is a total jerk who is only interested in his own opinion. If you type a paper and he doesn't like your view then your grade will definitely suffer. If possible, take anyone else. He is the absolute worst prof. I went to him for clarification on a grade, and he gave no assistance. I am an A student who received a D!",0
The quizzes are really hard. This class was very stressful. Quizzes were 15 questions each and they'd take at least half a day to do finish. If youre in nursing i do NOT recommend her. If you have no choice then get a study group together help each other on the quizzes.,0
RUN FOR YOUR LIFE!!!,0
"Hard grader, hard as heck, very stubborn.",0
"Professor Calkins is an incredible teacher and she really cares about her students progress, but it can be overwhelming if you aren't prepared to ask for help. I went to office hours when I was struggling and she went out of her way to help. She assigns a lot of reading, but grades very fairly.",1
She was the best Biology teacher I have ever had. She had a way of really making things clear and interesting.,1
"PSY 220 IS about the psych of learning. In this class you learn that punishment is ineffective. Ironic. If you do not get every single thing right, youll have to redo the entire assignment. To get beyond a D, yes a D, every assignment expects perfection. A class literally about learning, this was the antithesis. 400 level work for a 200 class.",0
"She is an amazing teacher, her lectures are never boring, she takes her time explaining things and does not move on until everyone gets what she is teaching. She truly cares about her students and is the sweetest lady. She gives you everything you need before a test to get an A. I have taken 3 of her classes so far & ended with an A each time!",1
Professor Walker is a nice guy who cares about his students and tries to get to know you on a personal level. He tends to go off topic a lot and lose track of time a lot however. Most of the time class is spent talking about random things going on in the world today than actual learning. If you want an easy A this is the class to be in.,1
"She's an amazing OB teacher. Very good lectures, she was direct and went straight to the things we need to know. Very nice and easy to talk to. I'm so glad I took her this semester,  I would recommend her!",1
"I'm normally not the type to be negative. I'm a hard working student and do my best. This wasn't an English class, more like Political. All our papers were on politics. She would spend endless time ""sharing"" her opinion. She gave me and another a C when he didn't even finish the paper and I only had 2 errors in five pages. I do not suggest. Awful.",0
I took an online class with him and he made the course super easy and fun! The work was minimum and not at all difficult. I ended with an A. He is an incredible and forgiving teacher.,1
"This is graduate class to expect to keep up on reading, participate in discussions and write a few long papers. She is a wealth of knowledge and more than willing to help. Super organized and returns assignments promptly and with quality comments.",1
"He was very chill at first, said that he only uses 2 hours out of 3 hours maximum, and does not require textbooks. And I thought he was a good professor. After a few classes, I saw how lazy he was. He posts another prof's notes on blackboard and expects you to read it before class, and in class he barely teaches. He's very lazy.",0
It is really hard to understand him. He does't say seam allowances and other info while doing the demo. hard grader and you don't get to hear why you received that grade.,0
Professor Duncan is an inspiring teacher. Lectures are always interesting and interactive. I'd take this class 100 times over!,1
I always tell fellow science undergrads to take a class with Anne. Incredibly passionate and thoughtful teacher. Definitely would like to have her as a professor again.,1
"Dr. Schore is the most memorable professor I've had at Davis so far, he made organic chemistry interesting and even enjoyable. He's very clear in lecture and makes difficult concepts easy to grasp. Do not be fooled by the examples he does in class, the exams are much more challenging. Textbook problems are similar to his exams.",1
Ms. Caron Breckel is amazing you will not regret taking her.  Either online or class she is willing to help you with anything she can. The best advice I can say is choosing her for you class and  the exam are not difficult all you have to do is study.,1
"She's a super nice professor and the content is somewhat interesting. The only problem I had was that she treats an intro class like it is the only class you have and gives you a crazy amount of work. If you like philosophy and want a lot of readings and assignments, then this is the class for you.",0
John Shon makes financial accounting doable but be ready to to put in work,1
"Try not to take this class if possible. Her lectures are so irrelevant and she often isn't prepared. She canceled class 3x in 3 weeks & we were expected to learn everything on our own. I honestly don't know why I showed up to class. If you are a self teacher and don't want to show up to class, this might be for you. She's very nice but can't teach.",0
"I love psychology with a passion but this has been by far the worst class I have ever taken. She is a sweet women but my goodness! I never even knew what my grades were because nothing was graded till the end of the semester, by that point I couldn't fix my errors on the next assignments. This was also a very unorganized.",0
He was the best professor I had all semester! He was funny and will make fun of students (sometimes). He uses real life examples in his lectures and made his own online textbook! Notes are taken daily and quizzes are about every two weeks. You will have two major test. I would love to take another one of his classes!,1
"very kind professor, and genuinely cares about his students. Reading the textbook is mandatory",1
He is a nice guy but his class is difficult. You have quizzes from the book every week and he expects every student to participate in the discussion. You are graded for participation. Sometimes his grading was very hot and cold. He didn't ever have anything good to say about my discussion posts and left long messages as to what I didn't do right.,0
"bad lecturer Has long pauses in the middle of sentences then starts talking about new ideas Notes are available online, but they dont help much Required to memorize 50+ ids for both midterm and final a lot of writing needed for a class without a writ. req",0
"poor presentation skills, and very less techniques covered in this course, but you can get A easily.. if you want to do some practical projects and find a job related to what you learn from this course, you should rethink about it. Don't waste time on his course, better take online course to learn more.",0
"I LOVED Susan! She made everything right to the point and clear for every student. She went over every problem on homework students could not understand which helped tons, and she had helpful study guides. It was a tough class but she made it enjoyable and you can do it! Her grading process was VERY fair if you actually studied. ",1
SHE IS THE WORST PROFESSSSSSOR! A TOTAL YOU KNOW WHAT...AND I HEAR EVERYBODY IS TRYING TO GET HER FIRED...HOPE IT WORKS BECAUSE SHE IS TRULY HORRIBLE!,0
"I love this guy, he's adorable and explains the material really well. I didn't think I'd enjoy the content of the class too much but I learned alot and he's a great professor, definitely recommended",1
We only meet once a week because this class is mixed mode and we often cut class short. I haven't learned anything that I couldn't just read out of the textbook and he makes the class way too easy. He will do anything to not give you 100% on an assignment even if he contradicts himself. I'm pretty sure he doesnt know anyones name and class is small,0
"very bad at explaining the material that he presents in the slides and on the board.  Very monotone, and even sitting in the front row, you can almost fall asleep and the class seems like eternity.  If you can do the homeworks 100% then you will do very well on the exam.",0
"She is more of an English teacher than she is music. If you occasionally mistype something, I would not suggest this teacher. I tried reaching out but she rarely responded. When she did, she always had an attitude.",0
"She is VERY into the material she is teaching. Although I am not english major, I admire her zest for life. Good teacher!",1
"The only teacher I've ever had that assigned a paper as ""read the book and write about anything""... and then counts off for not writing about the right thing.  He also said the word ""what"" out of context over 70 times in a 50 min class",0
"Her participation grading - stupid. Claims the way she grades you for coming is rewarding but you buy an app and get legitimately graded. You could show up and try but get a 50 on the questions. Her quizzes - easy. Use google and powerpoints. Her ""business problems"" are rough. Isn't challenging. you wont get an A. Time consuming... Learned nothing.",0
"TAKE. Sets you up for success! As long as you attend class, you do not need the textbook or look at the powerpoints he posts because he goes over the material that WILL be on the exam. Easiest class yet and im a sophomore. He drops lowest quiz grade and he reuses exams and quizzes from each semester. It was a stress free semester with an easy A!",1
"Great teacher, very nice man to talk to and is very organized",1
"online class.Highly recommend her. Laid it all out from day one. You could work ahead. Very organized, easy to follow. Multiple assignments due each week sometimes two weeks but very doable. She answers all emails right away and is very understanding when something happens. Work was fun and educational. Very motivating comments. Loved it.",1
"If you're taking this class to fill a core, think again. Provost is a geniunely nice guy, now that we got that out of the way. Multiple questions assigned every class (Marked very hard), a 10 page paper (9 sources needed), and get ready to be serenaded by his voice considering all he does is lecture all class #yawn. This class is reading heavy!!!!!",0
"READING is a MUST! Don't wait til the last minute to cram stuff. No multiple choice tests, but essays, matchingidentification, maps, etc. Expect pop quizzes & short writing assignments. Read his instructions very carefully. No D2L slides, so take notes. Awesome teacher! Engaging. I learned a ton. I'd take another one of his classes in a heartbeat.",1
He thinks his students know the same things as he does! does a poor job explaining anything in detail. wouldn't take him again and his tests are hard!,0
"She is very caring and fun. Most of the grades are online. There are many in class writing assignments, but they are easy and shes an easy grader.",1
"Good prof, funny, but tends to favor the males more. Hard to approach at times, but will usually help.",1
"Mladics a great instructor. He is very clear about what you will have to do in the class and what you will be graded on. There are never any surprise questions on exams. He will lecture you for however long the class lasts, so it might get boring if you dont care for the subject. However, if you ever have any questions, he's always available",1
"Reynolds is amazing. His lectures are fantastic, and his class sparked my interest in social sciences. I would highly recommend his class.",1
"He was okay, seemed a little distracted at times, but he knew his stuff. He was mostly helpful in the office hours and his lectures were usually enjoyable.",1
"Great teacher. Very understandable, helpful, and fun. Made discussion much more bearable.",1
"Seriously,  he is the worst teacher ever. I'm not just echoing what everyone else has said about him but this man cannot teach. he doesn't know what he going to teach in the class bcoz he uses other professor's powerpoint and he doesn't know some biological chemical reactions.  he is rude, disrespectful, and doesn't care for anyone or anything.",0
"If you dont lik long lectures and have trouble sorting out trough lots of information, good luck. Like myself there where many people who had trouble in the class and even though it was apparent she never bothered to go back over things or review any kind of material.",0
"When you take this course, you have to pay an arm and a leg to access a website called Mindtap which is basically the entire class. If you don't do well on those, good luck to you. His lectures are a total waste of time and only go over the very basics of what we're learning, while all the math and in-depth concepts are 100% on you to learn.",0
"Best teacher! He's crystal clear, helpful and his classes are never boring. He has a lot of experience and really knows his stuff. I highly recommend him!",1
She is very unorganized and unclear.,0
"He absolutely cares about your long-term learning, not just a grade in one class. He takes time to work with you in your real circumstances. When he can see you're putting in real effort, he'll give you a good grade. And he's really good at structuring assignments to actually assess whether you're learning, not just whether you can cram.",1
"he took 10 points off just because I attached files one the back of the report not in between, not clear of what he wants, take a lot of points for no reason. if you write a nice detailed report he will mark you off. he took 5 points off my lab because I wrote the results and explained why ! I wish I didn't take him TOUGH GRADER",0
"For such a difficult class (ASL I) she makes it fun, interesting, and comprehensive. It's the best way to learn ASL. YOU HAVE TO SHOW UP... or you will have no idea what is happening. But it's not hard to want to come to class.",1
Mrs . Hayden was a great teacher.. All you have to do is show up do the work and pass. She does games to help students pass their test .She is even nice enough to give you a cellphone number and you can email her. She respond quickly. She is also understanding of any family emergencies. I would definitely recommend this class.,1
"One of the best teachers at Bates, would definately recommend to all....",1
"All she ever does is read off what the questions will be on the test and on the days she doesn't do that, she has groups right a paper using 5 vocab terms, and the papers can be the crappiest and she doesn't care. I didn't learn anything from her class and it was such a waste. I would never voluntarily take her again. Great class for slackers",0
Had Dr. Bland at USC. Shes really nice and personable. She will work with you on essays if you did poorly and gives you another chance. Go to class always and always do the homework. Great prof and cares about her students. Only down fall is essay instructions are always clear.,1
Great Teacher. Would take his class again.,1
"Horrible! One of the absolute worst professors I've had to take. He says the content is easy if you study... that's bogus. Doesn't do well explaining concepts, and don't even bother with him in office hours. He comes off as cold and calloused.  He CLEARLY doesn't like teaching. SERIOUSLY! GO ELSEWHERE AND TAKE IT!!!",0
"very clear to the point. she is extremely easy going and easy to talk too. MUST read chapters. if you let them pile up, you wont's the tests. Discussion questions every week, very easy. MUST study for midterm and final. besides that cool professor.",1
"One of my first classes at CSN. He's a funny and smart teacher, but you really have to work to learn. These aren't easy concepts to grasp and the lectures don't make it much easier. The bookstore was backlogged for his book, so try to order it before the week before school starts. It's unlikely you'll be accommodated for the bookstore's failings.",1
WORST professor I had at BSU. Had to leave a 3hr lecture 10 minutes early for work and she called me out in front of class. Not accepting of non traditional students. Emailed her privately about a pregnancy that I wouldve liked to keep private but she talked loudly about it immediately after class in front of everyone & asked if it was planned.,0
"Ms. Mahon is nothing but amazing. She is the instructor we all need to get through this difficult course. Shes knowledgeable, caring, strict, and still able to demonstrates empathy. Ms Mahon genuinely wants to see her students pass and she gives you everything you need to do so. She my top recommendation",1
"Professor Ray is such a harsh grader for no reason. If you want feedback good luck. The class was converted to online, and he made it 10x worse.",0
Midterm is worth 25% and Final is worth 25%,0
"She talks about current events and wants to push her political opinions in your face every class period. During a speech, if she doesn't agree with you, she will debate you. Only two speeches, and speech content receives far more critique than speech delivery. She wants to make herself look good and make you look bad if you don't agree with her.",0
"Mr. Strange is the best professor I have had so far. He loves life, enjoys what he teaches, and has some GREAT stories. But I warn you, if you are looking for an easy A this might not be the class to take. If you do take this class be prepared to go to class everyday and listen and take down notes. But overall this was a GREAT CLASS!!",1
"I took this online. I wish I was more prepared for the amount of reading & listening for this course, theres alot. Sadly, I wouldnt have added it to a course load w/ another 4 credit class(acc101 b/c it became too much for me. You MUST make take time to read & listen to his lectures to make this an easy class to pass. Myers is a good, smart guy.",1
"Her lectures were not helpful at all, she tends to ""talk with herself"" and ignore students' question. She is probably really smart so it was hard for her to lower to students' level.  Lots of her exam problems are from recommended book problems. I got an easy A by going to CLAS.",0
"Best professor on campus! Lectures may be a little bit boring, but you do learn a lot. Plus, the exams and papers are easy; minimal studying.",1
"Easy class if you pay attention. Nice guy, gives extra credit, class participation is important. Attendance is a must, and don't be late!  He will not accept late assignments-No Exceptions.",1
2 midterms. 1 final. He assigns a pop quiz every lecture to keep the class awake. Exams are based on the lecture examples. Don't be afraid to ask him for help. He's a cool guy with an awkward sense of humor that helped the lectures go by lol.  10/10 would recommend.,1
"He is one of the best math teachers Ive had. He goes out his way to make sure you understand whats going on. Hes a very brilliant professor. Hell even bring in snacks to class. Like cupcakes before spring break! If you have to take stats, I highly recommend him. He returns emails pretty quickly as well.",1
"This is the worst teacher I have ever had. He does not provide handouts, he is full of himself and if you ask questions he tells you to read the book. He is lazy in his teaching and does not care about his students, only about his new house in EDH. Needs to teach to be a teacher not a money collecting job holder.",0
"EASY AS IT GETS.  2 essays and one in class essay. He takes things late and gives extra time for assignments. Lectures are boring, and he can get distracted and disorganized but worth the easy grade. NO BOOK EITHER! He provides his personal book online for you.",1
"Professor White responds to my emails with questions with ""no problem."" and my inquiries as to why I got a grade and how I can do better with, ""keep doing the work and maybe that will help."" Don't expect her to communicate with you, she also sends these replies 5 days to a week later. Exams require lockdown browser. Some coursework on quizlet.",0
"I thought he was horrible, i also thought she was the worst and mean teacher ever there, she thought she knew everything but in reality she didnt know a thing. if you dont have to take i wouldnt take her if i were you.",0
"Only two assignments for this class, the midterm and the final that are both take home essay format. You are given the questions for both at the beginning of the semester so you can work at your own pace. Only downside is that is your only two grades for the semester so you have to make sure you do well in order to pass. Lectures are funny.",1
OK. I took this class because of the ratings of this professor.. BOY what a mistake! Weeks 2-10 you are required to write a 3 page essay EACH week plus discussions with 3 replies min 10 sentences... then you do a 7-8 page research paper at end. no tests..im not one to shy away from work but this is crazy!! dropping this class!!,0
Not good,0
I have to say that I disagree with the person below me. I went a few times to his office and got the You should have understood this in class vibe. Also if I could make one suggestion to him I would say to try a bit more to listen to students better bc he would often interrupt students questions and then explain the wrong thing.,0
Lots of work outside of lab.,0
"EOSC 310 used to be an easy science requirement course, but not any more. Now you have to use a poorly written, unclear book with difficult, confusing weekly quizzes. Longridge was not helpful in answering questions or clarifying anything.",0
He is a very hard teacher to understand. He does not give you a study guide for either the midterm or final and does not tell you what is on either. He just expects you to study everything he's told you in lecture and material you have read. I barely passed with a C and i am an A student. Take a different teacher if you can.,0
Sweet guy,1
I went to Dr. Brooks and told him he could teach the class in Chinese and I would understand it better.  This class is difficult and will challenge even the best student.  Dr. Brooks has a tremendous amount of real world experience executing significant derivative trades and incorporates this into his lectures.  This class is exceptional.,1
"lectures were confusing, one word powerpoints that had nothing to do with the midterm or final exam. I was on the verge of failing the course, but the essay is a grade saver IF you follow exactly what she wants and uses the right format. She is a nice lady, but for soc202, not the right prof. Just throw the whole course away, not a bird course.",0
Strictest teacher I've ever met. Her rules are insane for lab she will kick students out of lab for wearing ankle socks! She also never posts grades so it makes it hard to tell how well your doing in lab. She also doesn't teach how to do any of the calculations or go over parts of the lab before you do it so your left to your own devices.,0
Wish we had an choice on the professor for this class.  She wasn't very approachable.,0
"Nice lady, not a very good professor. For Asian Art she blows by things so fast and goes off on tangents so when you leave the class you're thinking, ""what just happened"". Do not take her writing intensive classes.",0
"This professor is hard. You need to read tons of readings and articles prior class otherwise you have no idea what is she talking about. Participation is extremely important, she makes marks on her attendance sheet every time you participate. Her exams are tricky and confusing. If you want to get an A, then don't take her.",0
"She is the worst Intro teacher at this school.  She requires so much work, and the tests are so hard.  She is so vague about what she teaches, and your left with having no clue on what to study for each test.  Take Wilson for intro to music, cause he teaches an intro class the way it should be taugh",0
"Beba is awesome :)  Sure, she talks about costumer design a lot - but she knows her stuff!  She has done a lot of interestesing things in her career which she shares.  More work in the 2nd half - be prepared to write and see plays!  A few minor reaction papers, too.  Overall enjoyable class!",1
"Very helpful Professor, he gives good feedback and is accessible outside class. He responded to my emails in 24 hrs or faster and he even went out of his way to skype me to resolve my question. He gives very clear explanations with very clear grading criteria. Excellent network administration class and excellent Professor. I highly recommend them",1
She tends to stomp on many students if she does not hear the answer that she wants to hear. She doesn't take in other peoples' opinion and expect everyone to agree with her.,0
"She is very liberal and will call you out in front of the whole class if you are conservative. Papers are very controversial. She makes you sit in alphabetical order and bringing materials is mandatory. Basically, you are repeating eighth grade. She makes you do peer review and it is not very helpful at all. I dislike her but it is an easy A.",0
This class isn't that hard of a class. Professor Lovelace does tend to ramble on about everything. So if you dont like a rambler then don't take this class. He's a very cool person!,0
"PROF. Ball is an excellent professor, he always makes jokes an make sure you understand everything before moving on to the next topic. I highly recommend him for this course.",1
"Decent professor, not too hard but not extremely easy. I liked the way she taught, but the department had control of what was on the test. Stupid, but still did well.",1
"This class was a bit radical for my taste.  If you're an activist or you participate a lot in class, she'll love you.  Didn't really pay attention for the latter 3/4 of the quarter, but I was able to study and still get an A.  The term paper is not bad at all (4-6 pages).  She interrupts students a lot in my opinion, but whatever.  She's nice.",1
Worst professor I've ever had. Had him for Pentateuch and gospels in the same semester. His opinion is always right and if you disagree he will laugh at you. His assignments are ridiculous and he doesn't explain them. I am an A student and I got C's in both classes. He assigns a ridiculous amount of work and acts like his classes are the only ones,0
"I took Professor Thompson's summer course of Micro and it was easily the hardest class that I have ever taken. Does NOT give out extra credit, claimed that he did and at the end of course, never gave it out. Tests were timed 1 minute per question. Lectures were unrelated to the material. I was unemployed during Thompson's class and still got a B.",0
She is very nice and she loves what she does BUT prfessrs should know how to convey what they're saying properly and half the time I ask her a question I have no idea what she is saying All of the prelab quizzes have had AT LEAST one question that wasn't in the lab and had to be online and isnt whats in the lab reading thats right its what she says,0
"Probably the worst class I've ever taken. Lab was awesome because I felt I learned a lot even though he gives A LOT of assignments designed to take over your life and negatively impact your grades in other classes. Never knew what was going on in lecture though and his exams are ridiculous, don't test knowledge, just ability to answer questions BLA",0
"Awesome feedback.  Took the course online in the MHIT program, couldn't have asked for a better experience.",1
"Do not take Spanish 101 (5 week course). I get its suppose to be a lot of work because its cramped but Id recommend if you have to take a language, save it for the reg semesters. teacher gives out an absolutely insane amount of work.. everything is in Spanish.. even expects you to write full convos in Spanish by the first week. No Beuno! Lol",0
I REALLY enjoyed Dr. Schulhoff. Class is easy with weekly online quizzes. Attendance is not mandatory but is counted toward your participation/in-class activities grade. Only two tests (midterm and final). This professor really does care about getting to know her students and tries to make the class material enjoyable and relevant for everyone.,1
Has an excuse for everything and does NOT give useful study tools! He even brought his daughter to class during a midterm which was very distracting. Would not recommend this prof. He is a nice guy though,0
I LOVE PROFESSOR CARINA!!! she's soo awesome she lets you be yourself all the time even in your essays. She only gives short assignments every week and gives some reading that ARE NOT BORING! and she gave a short report by the end of the semester and THAT' IT! participate and be yourself and do small work and that's it. She's really funny + awesome,1
Keval is a decent/mediocre professor. It should have been a fairly easy course but somehow she made it very difficult when it came to grading.,1
"Out of the 20+ graduate courses I have taken, this has been the worst class. A lot of (outdated) readings (especially for an instructor who insists materials for the course paper be no more than 5 years old). Minimal work for a grad course. Not challenging for a graduate course either. And who gives tests at the graduate level??",0
"Like others have mentioned, the material itself is easy, but she made it really hard by giving a ridiculous amount of homework, with mandatory attendence of lectures, tutorials, and weekly quizzes. This is not high school, and learning should be independent at unviersity. Students should have right to decide which learning style best suits them",0
"This class was WAY too hard for a GE. The lectures were boring, and we had a group project that was worth 29% of our grade. The project was anthropology oriented, which had nothing to do with what we were learning in the class. We also had 5 exams while other professors had none. If you have other options, take the class with someone else.",0
My favorite professor at Wayne. Gives great feedback and how to improve in the future. Cares about her students and gives the best opportunities to learn the material.,1
"If you care about just passing this course, try to get a hold of old exams and keep re-doing them over and over again. If you actually want to learn the content, the lectures are very heavy and he moves very fast. So try to spend 1 hr everyday studying the lectures and understanding everything. The homework is very difficult, so most people cheat",0
"Good guy, good teacher",1
"This professor was great! Do not take Spanish with anyone else! She believes that this is a class that should not drop your GPA. She makes the material very easy to remember and helps you learn a lot. She prepares you well for the tests, so you know exactly what you need to work on going into it. Highly recommend!",1
"professor rombo is horrible, lecture slides have no information on them so if you miss one class you wont know what was going on that day. gives 3 tests including the final. ridiculously hard grader when it came to projects and assignments, she wont tell you what she wants but then will fail you if you dont magically give her exactly what she wants",0
Spanish sucks and there is no reason to make us take high levels of foreign language. this prof made it bearable.,0
Amazing. She's super sweet and understanding. She likes for the class to participate. There is a lot of reading and some assignments and tests. But if you go to class and understand what she is talking about than you'll do just fine on the tests. She is a very helpful professor who cares.,1
"Professor Hegbloom has no respect or sympathy towards her students. She is rude and if you email her, don't expect a response until midnight. She does not provide you with any necessary requirements for assignments she requires and expects you to know the information without teaching a single thing. I do not recommend her to anyone. She's horrible.",0
"Easy A. Quizzes, weekly discussions, 1 and 2 page papers every other week, and a final exam. Veerrry easy grader. Don't need the book. Discussions are majority of grade. Second time taking Dr. Larson",1
"You do have to work for a good grade, but Mike is generally an especially relatable professor to students. If you are looking to knock out some science credit, a class with Prof. Konen may be a worthwhile option for you.",1
"I had Herring for Math 15 and she was pretty good. She assigned a lot of hw, which really helped with lectures and doing workbook problems. She lectures a lot, but always made sure to make it fun. Practice tests are very similar to the real tests. Nice professor.",1
Professor Hetrick lectures the entire class and not on what the topic of the assigned paper is. Very few people get an A and I consider myself a strong writer. Takes forever to grade papers and even longer to pass back for feedback. Only test is the final. Definitely would not recommend. ,0
Beeeeeeeesssssssstttttttttttttttttt teacher I ever met!,1
"His class is incredibly challenging,but his classes are incredibly interesting. He's a tough grader.",1
"All info is presented and you have 2 months before things are even due. No interaction until something is graded, and she grades on technicalities, not if you even understand the materials. She comes across really pretentious and condescending. Exam questions are based on YouTube videos. Honestly this class is hard to pass and I have a 4.0.",0
BEWARE of missing assignments. No late work accepted. I completely missed a due date on a paper (i didn't see anything was due) and he wouldn't accept any late work. Dropped my class average from a 94 to an 82. There went my 4.0 GPA! Other than that this class is easy.,0
"She is one of New Paltz finest.  Accounting is not the most enjoyable class, but she does her best.  Works with you for tests and always helpful fduring office hours.",1
There is a lot of homework in this class. I don't like that we learn most of this stuff on the computer then he teaches it afterwords. The thing I don't like is the test heavy part of the course.,0
"SO many errors on her tests. EVERY test we had there were at least two questions she had to go and ""consult"" with another instructor about. She is CONSTANTLY talking about irrelevant information (her son and her ""granddog""). Over half of lecture was spent talking about her family. You don't learn in her class!",0
"Daily clickers that make up a large portion of your grade so you have to go to class. Englund is very unhelpful outside the classroom and also hard to get a hold of. His tests are hard, get ahold of someone with his tests from last semester and study those and you should do fine. Very strict about cell phones and will kick people out.",0
"Participation definitely matters in this class but if you simply talk once or twice, she'll give you full credit. Peters is a tough grader but is very reasonable at the same time. She follows the syllabus very closely.",1
"yea, dr. laudan is barry's secret weapon!!.....boo ya!",1
"Great instructor. Course is easy if reading is done & effort is made. Consistent, fair, quick grader. Quick Communication. Participated in forum. Fair work load. Open book & untimed quizzes - MC & essay, power point, and paper. I learned a LOT! One of my favorite classes so far & interest was peaked. I would take another course with Prof. Browning.",1
"If you want to fail a course, go ahead and take a class with this instructor. He's unorganized, and his teaching motto is ""I write on board and you figure out"", um okay? Then why have an instructor? English isn't his 1st language so there's a MAJOR language barrier, if he doesn't understand your question he completely ignores you.",0
"URGH! If you are taking this course as a pre-req for nursing, DO NOT BOTHER WITH HIM! He is a mess. His teaching skills are all over the place, he's' very unorganized and HE IS RUDE AS HELL! He makes you buy the book & connect and doesn't even use either! I unfortunately had to drop the class because honestly I just couldn't stomach him anymore.",0
"For a three hour online class she assigned hours of homework every week, typically given only 4 days prior to the due date and made you stay for the full 3 hours online with only a 15 minute break. She gets very behind on grading and is hard to get ahold of by email. Because of this it is hard to receive feedback on how you are doing in the class.",0
"Overall I really enjoyed this class. It was very easy and she was really up front and honest. However, she did offer extra credit 2 times but then counted it as a regular paper. Not sure if she just got confused or what happened. I still received an a in her class though.",1
I took Spanish 102 with her and it was actually very enjoyable.  She doesn't start out too hard on students and its easy to get back up to speed with Spanish. She's very easy to understand and none of her assignments and exams are really difficult. She actually makes learning Spanish fun again. ,1
"You would expect a professor who teaches an online class to respond to her emails... Well at least that's what I expected. The course is designed poorly, but the exams aren't too hard. The labs didn't really make sense and were unorganized. Blackboard is copied and pasted from past years and there are a lot of spelling mistakes. Do not TAKE!!!!!!!!",0
"God awful professor, he cant answer a question straight forward for his life. Every time you ask him something he gives you more than his life story and then doesn't even answer the question. He is absolutely unorganized and every time he opened his mouth i cringed at the thought of what would come out. Would not recommend him to anyone. ever.",0
"Such a fun class! As long as you show up, it's really easy to pass.",1
She is the worst professor I ever had. She is very rude.,0
"I want to say that Shaokang knows two languages better than I ever will. That being said, being a native Chinese speaker, he does not have a thorough enough understanding of English to properly teach a class without most of the students getting lost along the way. There's also no textbook so good luck trying to teach yourself.",0
"He only assigns two tests and 4 essays, so you only have a few assignments all semester to make your grade. As long as you attend almost every class and put effort into your papers, you should pass. He also never cancels class and assigns a bunch of reading, but it isn't that bad. He is really helpful and a good professor though. I'd recommend him.",1
The people that left good reviews are just trying to make prospective student suffer just as they did. DO NOT TAKE ORALCOMM WITH SARALINA It is impossible to get an A in her class. She is unresponsive to emails and is very condescending.,0
"SHE IS A AWESOME TEACHER HAD HER FOR ANOTHER CLASS. HER MIDTERM AND FINAL ARE TAKE HOME. SHE MAKES CLASS FUN, NEVER A DULL MOMENT. I HAVE BEEN TELLING ALOT OF PEOPLE TO TAKE HER IF THEY CAN.",1
Told us all assignments are on hold during move to online which was a 2 week period and then did not change the course load. Actually made us go back and complete assignments that would have been due even though we were not in session for that time period. Can't give him a bad enough rating.,0
"intense teacher, she is very smart and makes class interesting.  she's helpful, she gives guides for how to go about difficult reading. the class is hard, prepare to do a lot of work, make sure to prepare for class, she likes it when students speak up.",1
HORRIBLE.,0
She lectures all class even when theres nothing to be lectured on. She makes everything seem easy enough when its not. When you ask questions she acts like she doesn't understand the question so you give up. I went the whole year with an A then the last essay she graded so hard my overall grade dropped to a C. horrible lady,0
Great instructor. Nice guy and I really liked the class,1
"I wrote over 25 papers for this class -- 3 papers a week on average for INTRO to Literature. His essays are incredibly vague and you will have to go to office hours for help since he does not make it clear what he wants. I recommend taking any other professor for this course. Show up to class, read the material, and work for your grade.",0
Online lectures and textbook did not provide enough information to complete assignments. Instructor not as accessible as needed.,0
took the online class. Lectures were LONG. I studied lectures thoroughly at first but didnt find the first study guide which killed me on the first test. then i stopped watching his lectures and just studied the final study guide and aced the final. could have gotten a B but didnt know there were listening assignments. Dropped me down two grades.,0
"You need to read a lot by yourself. His grading most on lecture quizzes, but just be careful. And lab quizzes are not hard.",0
"his lectures are funny, interesting, and sometimes very moving.  i was not looking forward to this class and i loved it.  considering his quizzes are simple translations and papers get proofread by other students AS WELL AS the prof. and TA you have to be an idiot to do badly.",1
"The class is more of an art criticism class. Most class periods were not painting. We listened to her slideshows for many class periods, and when it was time to paint she wouldn't let you start painting unless she liked the idea herself. Made me feel bad about myself as a painter. Pushes her agenda on you. Take if you like abstract art.",0
She was awesome! She gives lots of extra credit and I made a B on her first test with no studying! Just take notes (which are slides and she posts half on webct) and you should be fine. I don't know what these other guys are talking about.,1
"The class is a LOT of busy work, but it's definitely not hard. You just need to show up and do what she says, but be prepared to be treated like a little kid. Her class reminds me of kindergarten.",0
"I left a review earlier and had to come leave another one because throughout the semester he changed my mind. He's actually very decent, but had a rough semester because of leg injuries he had. He does care about students and their grades, and wants you to leave his class having learned something, which I did. I don't regret taking his class",1
"I can definitely see why people may not like him, but he has been one of my favorite professors here at Temple. Makes you work hard and earn your grade, but you get so much out of his class.",1
Dr. Meyer genuinely cares for his students and makes it clear and easy for students to pass! He let's you know exactly what he expects of you as a student. His lectures are engaging and beneficial for anyone going into counseling. I also had him for CSG421. Both classes were taught the same way. He is also flexible on deadlines and over-skipping.,1
"This professor is amazing, you will need a textbook for the worksheets she assigns as homework. Her lectures are really interesting, and she makes it easy to get a good grade. She only gives two essays the entire essay, this class is really easy and entertaining. I highly recommend this class.",1
"A little sporadic, but was always available for outside help... Even left his cell number on the syllabus so we could get in touch with him for questions.",1
"Even though you complete all the hws and goto every single class, you receive no grade if you don't participate. :/Most of the people in my class are extremely confused and DO NOT understand what he is saying. This professor makes everything difficult and confusing. Don't ever take his class...",0
"Very helpful, enjoyable to be in her class. She gave us 3 pre-exempt absences. Very thorough in class, always worried about your grades and helps you in office hours. She cares about your grades.",1
"THE MOST HORRIBLE CLASS EVER TOOK. He's really boring and doesn't help you on the quizzes, and makes you do a  useless group projects. He reads off the power points. He doesn't use  Canvas to grade the work, but it is through SAM.  Answers from the quizzes are not from the book so wouldn't recommend to read the book look it up from a different sour",0
"Lowers points in assignments if he disagrees with you, even if you did the assignment correctly. Tough grader and very confusing tests. Interesting topic but terrible professor.",0
Mr. Hawk is amazing. There are short (300 word) responses due each week but they are easy and you learn a lot! I have learned more in this one class than any other class before. Not much about English but lots about the world and society and just how to live a better life. He cares about his students. Take him if you have he chance!!!!!!!!!!,1
"So the class itself is not that hard, most of it is common sense. BUT she is horrible at reading and answering emails, She sends the same email to everyone thinking that they are talking about the same thing. It was supposed to be a two day online class but then she changes everything to one day. Discussion board she grades harshly as well.",0
Gives a bit of extra credit that's super easy. Totally willing to help you with your papers/ assignments. Very flexible and will let you make up if you miss something. Super easy to pass. 2 easy papers and a final. Literally the best teacher I have ever had. Taking her again for 1C!,1
"This woman is the devil.she gives no help. If u ask her what u did wrong her reply will be something ""like u don't listen or NO"".. All she dose is talk about herself. And expect you to know ever line of ever poem or story. I wrote a 8 page paper for her and she gave me a 58 on it and told me that was being generous. I asked what I do wrong her reply ""what didn't you do wrong now get out of my office"".. The lady is hart less.. Take her if you want a F-.",0
Long and repetitive lectures. Also won't answer questions about final paper through writing and pushes phone conferences. Would not recommend.,0
The class is hard and boring. He murmurs to himself and you cant hear what he's saying.,0
"She refuses to explain anything, to answer any question asked or help any student that approaches her. She showed up to the mid-term ten minutes late and didn't comp. the time, then later criticized the whole class for having poor time management skills. She never arrives prepared and has to leave the room half every class to print out materials.",0
"Mr. Mac is a very lively teacher and gives a lot of real life examples. Make sure you get as many points as you can from attendance, labs, homework, and tests because the final is pretty hard. On every test, you have the opportunity to get 12 extra  points of out 150 and attendance points WILL help your grade in the end.",1
its really helpful to practice the quizzes online and memorize the lab very well.,1
"Ms. Howson's style of teaching can be a little blunt and takes some getting used to. Once you do, though, it becomes very easy to get into the material.  Group assignments are pretty fun and not that stressful, but get ready to do lots of in-depth writing for this course especially.  Some readings may get a bit complex.  A great teacher overall.",1
"Professor Hinshaw is very nice and approachable, but I found his class boring and his teaching overrated.  He reads from his powerpoint slides, which makes it useless to go to class, since you can stay home and read them yourself.",1
He has a very thick accent and spends most of the class writing theorems and equations on the board without explaining what they do. Exams are way harder than the content seen in lectures and homeworks. Do not take his class if you are not ready to learn all the topics by yourself.,0
"Doug is an AMAZING teacher, by far my favorite I've had of any teacher at NMC. He is clear in assignments and very helpful with developing techniques, and getting more comfortable with mediums that you are not as comfortable with. Can't wait to take Drawing 2 with him! Highly recommend!",1
He sucks. He puts his religious beliefs on his test and just sucks a lot.,0
Great professor. Easy assignments. Tests are challenging - but overall a really easy class! Take this class!!!,1
"I could not stand this professor. Dashley was one of the worst math teachers I have ever had. She was just completely rude when a student would ask a question. By the end of the semester, no one wanted to participate because she was so degrading in her responses. Also, how she grades your homework is ridiculous...",0
"He knows everything, in every subject area--even other professors admit it. Can be pompous but his breadth of knowledge can spark enthusiasm and inspire students if they're willing. Witty, always keeps class interesting, and is understanding if you don't have a serious music background.",1
"Ouyang is nice, but a really difficult professor.  He reads straight off the slides, offers no real explanations, and the project work is insanely difficult.  If you take this course, pair yourself up with someone strong in accounting, especially if your new to the topic.",0
She'd erase something she put on the board 2 or 3 times. Doesn't understand the problems she puts on webassign and doesn't use the textbook. She didn't know how to answer students questions,0
"JAMS 505 with Rachel was great! Her lecture were interesting and she threw in some extra credit very often as long as you showed up. Her passion for research was very motivating. Although slightly disorganized, she will make sure you pass her class and is always ready to help you out. Will def be taking her again!",1
He gives a study guide for every test. Just listen to directions and use the resources and you will do fine. He cares about teaching and is is accessible to all students.,1
"Amazing professor! She really pushes you to your full potential. Although she doesn't always use her powerpoint during lecture, she keeps the lecture entertaining and makes the material easier to understand. As a clinical professor, she is fast paced and keeps you on your toes. She may keep you past lunch so make sure you bring a quick snack.",1
I literally suck at anything math but professor Silva made stats so easy to understand!! Definitely recommend taking his class.,1
"Good man, very nice, but shouldn't be teaching anymore. First quiz was very easy, midterm was very hard due to poorly worded questions. Second quiz should have been easy but like his previous exams there were mistakes riddled throughout. Average for the class rn is maybe around a 50 (you can see everyones grade).S/U-covid is saving my GPA luckily.",0
"Best Professor! She let's you know what you need to do to improve, and really makes you learn. I've never forgotten anything she has taught me, whereas with other classes, I kind of study for the test. Make sure to do the readings and keep up with the work and it'll be easy!",1
"Not a great professor, but definitely not terrible. Lecture is a bit hard to pay attention to (boring and slow) but he covers all the content fairly well.",1
"He made a 3 hour class very fun and interesting by splitting time between lectures and activities. Test are multiple choice, matching, and essay, not cumulative. No textbook, but he assigns articles to read that can get lengthy. 4-5 short essays & 1 group project throughout the semester. Overall, great teacher with lots of experience in the field.",1
She grades like it is a 400 level course and she never answers her email so don't bother trying to ask her for help through an email. Avoid getting her at all costs,0
Was the worst teacher I have ever had :( Was defensive when you asked for help... received no help! Had to get a tutor to pass the class.,0
"I took the 8-week online course and wow. If you don't pick up concepts quickly or if math does not come easy for you, I suggest taking the full semester or another professor. There were no lectures, just textbook and videos from the textbook/WebAssign. The amount of homework was almost comical, totaling close to 1000 math problems for 8 weeks.",0
"Very funny and caring teacher. Enjoyed having her as a professor and was very clear on what was expected in class. Very lecture heavy and are not given notes outside of class, so you need to attend class in order to pass. She drops lowest exam score, which includes non-cumulative final, so I didn't have to take the final which was a bonus!",1
She's very fair and Cengage was messing up the portion of the class by marking incorrect answers and the assignments every week are 1-2 pages and she grades them very easily. TestsQuizzes were easy online with exam 4 optional (final).  I respect her for her effort and she is a good person to get to know on an individual level! Easy AB course!,1
She is not at all clear on what she wants on assignments. When receiving your grade there are no comments on what to change and what was wrong with it!,0
"Terrible teacher. Gets off topic during lecture, and highly subjective grader. By the end of the semester the teacher did not input at least half of the grades i received in the course, only the final letter grade two weeks after taking the final.",0
horrible horrible professor... AVOID POINTLESS CLASS,0
"Great teacher! Very inspirational and fun! She's super-fast when you email or text her. She even does grade drops at the end. Tests and quizzes are pretty easy because you can use your book or notes at home. She helped me overcome my fears with fun and simple stuff in class. I got an A, so I recommend.",1
"I really enjoyed this class to start with, but I found that Martin made the content more confusing than it should have been. You can learn the same amount from going to two weeks of his lectures as you can from watching a 12 minute YouTube video on the subject. He gives no application type questions, everything is theoretical, and only grades tests",0
Lectures are not effective at all! I took all exams without following the lectures and I got an A-,0
"Did not enjoy class, talks about theory and derives equations rather than doing an example.  Tests are on applied problems, not theoretical.",0
Funny,1
"I feel like marketing could have been an interesting topic for me if I only had a different professor. He relies mainly on a marketing simulation group project to teach you the concepts, but I learned next to nothing from it. Not a great teacher, and I he is often quite rude as well.",0
"This was supposed to be about literary study and instead I got stuck with learning about love and hate and society which was weird. The books she chooses are dumb, she's a hard grader, she's very unorganized and I just didnt get what her point was.",0
As the others have said If you want to major in poetry take his class but if you are just taking the class because you have to for your GED or your major then don't. We were required to have five different books. He wants you to write in a similar matter as Aristotle and Plato. I took the W on my transcript rather than staying in his class.,0
"Super fun if you engage her, just participate in class and you will do fine.",1
"this guy,he thinks he's smart but I am so regreting taking his class.sucks that there is only one Organic Chemistry lecture for BSU...during lecture he talks alot but its useless...Its better off to study through online lectures from other universities. I studied with Yale online lecture and it helped me to pass this class.",0
"Get ready to read 60+ pages a week. Her lectures are boring and she has a horrible turn around for grading. She grades the papers easy, but she waits until after you have taken the final to grade your homework assignments, so if you weren't doing well on them you would have no idea and would be given no opportunity to improve. Don't take her.",0
He did let you replace a test grade,0
"Wonderful! All homework and quizzes on my accounting lab (like mymathlab) with easy ""help me solve this"" solutions. Miss Errico will help you do any HW probs you need help with. Two tests, you get very similar practice tests to practice on. There is one final paper, I got 100%, just do your research and follow instructions. Don't miss assignments.",1
Shes really rude to her students well at lest the ones who dont know anything about ASL . I did 3 DLAs truin them in on time and she did not give me credit for it . Really rude as well . Dont take her . The book is over 100 in addition you have to pay an other 25 + do the DLA,0
"He's a very nice polite man. It's too bad his lectures were very boring and sorta awkward at moments. I'm not sure I would take him to learn or have him as a mentor because he's very black & white & goes by what's given. Class was very easy though. He allowed a typed cheat sheet for exams, curves a lot, and kind of an easy grader. DON'T BUY BOOK!",1
Worst professor I have taken in 3 years at this university. His operating systems class uses an in development language called Rust with a buggy compiler and no real world application. His assignments deal with web servers and shells and emphasize learning this language rather than operating systems.,0
"Very sweet. Easy class, she makes it straight to the point and easy. Just review before test, you'll do good.",1
"She is nice enough but she grades hard and is not very willing to negotiate. Speaks in spanish most of the time, likes group activities, but is fairly hard to learn from. Does not correct students' pronunciations often. Learned more from substitutes (Steve Irwin and Ari Gutman).",1
"Not the best, doesn't keep the classes attention.",0
Prof. Shine is a good professor. Hes very knowledgeable and understanding. His lectures are difficult because most of the time he will go off topic then switch back to the topic. Its nice to have the option to redo your midterm until youre happy but its tough when you dont know whats going on. Lost interest quick due to confusion.,0
"The most understanding teacher at PSC. Although, there was no lectures for this class, he would help in anyway he could. I would recommend him to anyone.",1
Doesn't know what she wants to say to the class. Doesn't have any type of lecture plan. Teaches very slow and speaks very low.  ,0
If I had the chance to go back and tell myself not to take this course I absolutely would. She is the worst possible teacher you could get at this school. All students fail her exams and she gives no help because even she doesnt understand the material. Cant even answer questions in office hours because you are expected to know it already,0
"Very smart man, definitely has considerable knowledge in terms of sound reinforcement. However, his tests are unnecessarily difficult  and most of the questions on the test don't pertain the textbook, lectures, or study guides he hands out. I would not recommenced taking this class if you have no experience working with sounds systems.",0
"I took this class as a grad student & it was over the summer for six weeks, & it was a hybrid but it was a lot of work. She starts on time & ends on time. Dr. Kim has a certain way for all of her assignments. Just follow along & you will get a good grade, complete the work on time, & you actually look a lot & the book isn't a bad read.",1
"Great guy, but makes the course very tough. Gives you weekly homework which is not bad, but then the exams do not contain anything from the homework, they are just from his really long lecture notes. Not the most interesting class.",1
"Kind of disappointed by the rate my professor when I first enrolled for this class. This class wouldn't let anyone of us breathe. Each week we had a discussion, 2-3 activities, 4 hw assignments, 10 pages of modules to read, 2-3 hours worth of video notes to watch and fill in, 4-5 quizzes, 4 exams throughout the semester, and a project. GL.",0
Utterly incoherent. His lectures are a colossal waste of time - just review the slides on your own.,0
"I have taken two of his classes the first one was amazing, however the last one I took was horrible. His lectures are long and boring. He miss graded an entire classes  quizzes. He kept pushing off test and only made it half way through the material which was to be taught.",0
Lab with Prof Stevenson is the best! She is VERY clear about what she expects you to know for the test. She goes around and quizzes you during each unit which was super helpful. She always makes sure there is extra time the week before a test to review anything you want from the lesson. Use your time wisely in her class and you will be fine.,1
Never take! I ended up withdrawing from her class because of her grading. I received all 0's on major assignments for small errors like a spelling mistake. Absolutely horrible,0
"*online class* This class shouldn't be taken online. Her notes were hard to understand, any feedback from her is non-existent. Self-taught class.",0
"LOVED her!! She is the sweetest lady. I only took her for BIO lab 118 (for bio 112) but I loved every minute of it. I always found BIO to be so hard, but she made it fun and understandable. I was so sad to see that she wasn't teaching lab for 113! Take her if you can, she is super helpful and an overall good teacher.",1
"OK, I realize a lot of people do not like this class, but as someone who does not understand math at all, I thought Rayburn was extremely helpful especially during office hours. The class itself is not easy, but you get to use a notecard on tests and he gives extra credit. I thought he was actually a pretty good teacher.",1
Very easy class he explains everything in depth so its very easy to understand. going to class helps understand material tests are easy mainly common sense and the reviews provide answers. i would highly recommend,1
Professor Mattson is a great professor. He's really nice and helpful. Just make sure you do your blogposts on time and you'll be golden. I enjoyed his class and met awesome people.,1
"Not clear, unapproachable, isn't coherent. His tests aren't feasible. Tests are based off of his lecture notes if you can even call them lecture notes. Instead of being objective in the material he is teaching he likes to throw in how he sees the topic. This class isn't convenient for visual learners.",0
She is difficult. Only give 10 minutes only per quizzes and it's given every week for sure. She takes off points for the tiny things like if you don't put a degree symbol its like 2 points off. So ridiculous! She expects a lot of memorization. SHE DOES NOT LET YOU USE FORMULA CHARTS FOR THE EXAM! You would have to learn the formulas by memory :(,0
"She is a horrible professor, absolutely horrible. She tell you you're doing something wrong and will tell you how bad something is embarrass you in front of the class and not even help you to do better. She always brags about how much experience she has yet it doesn't show. I have never met a professor that almost every student has a problem with.",0
"I never want to take a drawing class at Bard again after this. The assignments were reminiscent of high school, and sometimes too vague and sometimes too restricting, but never in the middle.",0
Gives plenty of extra credit. no need for textbook. sends out reminder before test and assignment due dates. ,1
"There was one quiz, a paper, a mid-term and a final, so overall, not a lot of work, but your grade rests on only these things. Hard to pay attention because she is barely audible. I would have been more inspired/ learned more with another professor.",0
She was very nice and you can tell she cared about her students but the class was just too hard. I would compare my tests with students with other professors and the tests weren't nearly as hard.,0
"Sis. Derby is a very nice person but a very hard teacher. If you don't do things exactly like she would do them, you will be marked down. It can be very discouraging. This course is also very difficult and time consuming. There is so much information thrown at you that it's hard to keep up. Expect to spend at least 20+ hours a week on assignments.",1
"I made an A in this class simply because the exams were departmental, and they were much easier than the work we did in class. He is a really nice guy who is willing to help, but he is just not a good teacher. He made things so much harder than they had to be in class, and he confused me more than he helped.",0
"Professor MacArthur is a double edged sword. If you are a non-English major looking for an easy English class, he is your man. Just prepared to be bored to death. Bring work from other classes to do. However, if you are a serious English major, he is a waste of your money. You will learn nothing because he is busy rambling about irrelevant topics.",0
"Metzl is the man, and his class is both interesting and easy. His powerpoints were awesome, and there were two brief papers to write, on top of a semester long project and easy final exam. He's got a great sense of humor and really seemed like he cared. Highly recommend to MHS majors",1
She really doesn't care about anything or anyone except for her PUENTE program.,0
"Professor Heilman does an excellent job engaging with her class through lectures, both asking and answering pertinent questions. She provided excellent lectures that kept students engaged and interested. Tests were fair and marking wasn't too harsh.",1
"I had Gilmore for SOC110/120, and his 180AW is largely based around his teachings in those previous classes. Writing proposal as your final, along with a presentation to the class of your findings and work. It is a seminar class so you will need to speak in class. My advice, get to know the TA. They will be grading all of your work!(alex o is gr8)",1
"too much work, and assignments are not as inspiring as she believes",0
"Okay first off. Shes pretty cute. But other than that she grades really tough. Only makes one or two comments on papers and deducts 20 to 30 points. Dont even think about talking when shes lecturing, she actually puts your name down then decucts points from participation. She is also a very boring and slow speaker, but shes still hot!",0
She's a sweetheart and wants everyone to succeed. She will give you a review for quizzes and exams. She's usually always available and willing to help. She also does open labs and will help out with anything you need. She can get a little crazy sometimes but Karen is a gem.,1
Professor Thiel is one of the toughest graders ever and it is very hard to earn an A in this course. There is very little room for error in this course especially that it is an intro to philosophy class and he made this course way too hard. I earned an A but I had to work really hard and I recommend you do not take this class.,0
"Inspirational professor. I learned to appreciate math in his class. He posts helpful practice questions, is reliably available for help, and is a comfort when you have a problem. Great at sarcastic deadpan.",1
This is my first time taking a hybrid class and I liked it much more than I thought. You have to go to class for lectures that were mainly discussion  and the prof really makes them interesting. You do assignments online -  I liked the Mastery Training excersises a lot! The topics are really interesting and worth it.   Good class!,1
She is the single WORST prof I have ever had! She is scatterbrained and contradicts herself. She is rude when asking questions are asked and literally just rants about plants and climate change. Grading criteria for midterms is nonexistent and she expects you to be an expert on the subject even though her lectures are utterly useless. Good luck,0
Mike is a great professor who really cares about his students. This is his last semester at Volstate and easily one of my favorites.,1
Awesome teacher! Very inspired and knows a ridiculous amount. And he's totally hot!,1
Delivered his live lectures brilliantly despite the current situation. Go to office hours for assignment help. TAs for this course are the most helpful I have had so far. Try out all the previous years' exams if you want to ace the midterm and final. Course is not so challenging if you put effort into it. Highly recommend Pat for 2804.,1
"Great looking guy, enjoyed looking at him more than learning the material - no wonder I got a bad grade?",0
"I was really bummed when I didn't score high on my Compass test because it meant I had to take this course, but Ms. Cambic made class enjoyable. As long as you study the vocab, read the book assignments, and participate in class you'll for sure earn an A. She's the sweetest!",1
AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL. HOW ABOUT YOU  STOP BEING LAZY AND PREPARE FOR CLASS. THIS MAN HAS BEEN LECTURING FROM THE SAME TIRED NOTES FOR SEVERAL YEARS. WORTHLESS!!!!!,0
"The worst teacher I've had. If this is your first time taking a college class talk to your advisor and make sure you don't get her. Incredibly vague in her directions and gets upset when you ask for clarification, just citing the directions again. I went into this class with a passion for writing. Not so much anymore. Way too hard for English 101",0
Excellent professor. Definately one of the best I've ever had. Very organized and brilliant man. His tests are difficult but you learn so much from him. I would definately recomend him to anyone!,1
"I did take his class his class online during the whole COVID19 situation. Despite that, it wasn't enjoyable at all. He's hard to understand in both speaking and writing. Don't expect him to respond to emails at all. Makes too many mistakes in class. Tests are way too hard with little time to finish. You're better off looking for someone else.",0
Hands down the best math teacher I've ever had. I feared Math until I had Alisa's class. she explains things in a way that makes it easy for non math folks to understand. Her tests are hard but she prepares you for them really well. I would recommend her to anyone!,1
"Fabulous class! I learned so much from Prof. G, she is excellent at explaining difficult concepts and giving examples. Plan to take her for all classes I can.",1
LAW BUSI 2301.83448/93408 . DR. RANDY WATERMAN GIVES YALL VERY GOOD REVIEW B4 THE TEST DAYS. HE ALSO GIVES YALL LOTS OF EXTRA BONUSES CREDITS IF YALL FAILED THE EXAMS TO MAKE IT UP. THX PROF.,1
This is a french oral class and I am quite disappointed with it. Juliet is a very nice person but the oral class is not strictly formatted and there is hardly any french conversation and activities done between students to help improve their french. The course is quite boring and not worth taking. ,0
"He really cares about the point he's trying to make and he thinks everyone should care about it. I took him for African American history but he seemed like he knew what he was talking about and knew a little bit about the struggle. He talks a lot, but he gives you a chance to say your two cents. I like the music he chose and the pictures are good.",1
"This class met once a week.  There was a lot of material to cover in that time period.  While there was a lot of lecture, questions were always accepted, both before class and by email.  Office hours were also useful for getting clarification.  He let us use class time to organize study groups as well.  ",1
"Very  good professor.  Really knows his stuff and is willing to share his knowledge with the class.  Don't get too pressed about buying the book right away . May not even need it if you keep up with the slides.  Other than that, the class was pretty easy and just show up!",1
"If you take any of Professor O'Quinn's classes, make it the one class that you show up to consistently and LISTEN. Seriously. Listen to what he has to say. He's one of the most brilliant English profs I've ever had and can make even the driest subjects mind-blowing. If you show up with enthusiasm and pay attention, you will learn so much from him.",1
"This class wasn't bad, but it definitely cannot pass just by memorizing. You HAVE to understand the material and be able to apply it, there are many drugs and you need to stay on top of the course work.",1
"Of all the classes I have taken at CSUDH, this class was by far the hardest one ever.  I took a Saturday class thinking it would be an ""easy A"" but I never worked so hard!  So many assignments and the book at the end was such a chore to make.  He is very nice and very mellow and yes his slow way of speaking can put you to sleep but overall it was a",1
He is unable to actually teach anything without having the book to tell him the answer. He looks to the students for answers to the problems he is supposed to be teaching us! he is not organized at all and comes to class unprepared. Do not take his class!,0
"Dr. Singer is very difficult to follow, he makes mistake after mistake and is constantly making corrections on the board confusing us even more so. If asked a question, many times he becomes irritated and will repeat ""too many questions"" I will not take a class with him again. I would highly suggest checking into SCC for course equivalents.",0
She is really great at teaching. If you miss a few classes you need to get notes from someone in your class or you will be lost. She's very understanding and she will try to make sure you understand her lecture before moving foward with the lecture.,1
"Overall a great teacher. She offers so much extra credit its impossible not to get a good grade. The content itself is really hard, but she understands the struggles that we go through as students and is willing to talk.",1
"his bioethics class was great. interesting material, and if you're willing to participate great discussions. he is really enthusiastic, and you will get a lot out of his class if you put in a little effort. tough paper grader, but he's willing to provide as much help as you ask for.",1
She is a very nice and understanding professor but her class was so boring. It was so hard to get through but she uses tophat and asks questions for participation so you have to go to class. We had no exams just a lot of quizzes that were difficult. I am not interested in the topic but her lectures just dragged on and you also have to take a lab.,0
"Tripp is by far the easiest and most helpful teacher I've ever had. If you know what you're doing, you just show up and do your work and he wont bother you at all. If you need help, you just raise your hand and he's happy to help. If you aren't good at doing stuff on your own, then you wont learn though. He lets you do your work as you please.",1
Professor Marks was the best Spanish teacher I have had throughout high school and grad school. Very helpful. Very willing to answer questions. Very passionate about Spanish and well-versed. Easy to understand. Fair Grader. Wish I could take all my Spanish classes with him.,1
"The GOOD: 
 - He uses a points system for grading, and gives you points for attendance.
 - Some of his quizzes are group quizzes, which are easier to pass.
 - Gives out a lot of extra credit work
 The BAD:
 - very unorganized
 - A lot of essay assignments
 - Made our class purchase access to an online program called MyCompLab which we used ONLY ONC",0
Makes the lecture fun and interesting. Prepares you for exams and assists with Mikes Bikes. super laid back and here for your success. 10/10 would recommend!,1
"He's an amazing teacher, is impossible to fall asleep in his class. You'll love this subject because of this guy, but he is a hard grader. Awesome teacher.",1
Señor Newall cares about his students and this class shouldn't be hard if you're decent at Spanish and keep up with the readings and homework that every SPAN 210 class gets. He gives good lectures to supplement the homework and leaves a lot of his class for practicing grammar and conversation. Would take again.,1
Daigle's microeconomics class was very difficult for me. He's not a good lecturer. He mumbles a lot and doesn't want to explain things to you when you ask him about them. He is quite sexist also. His tests are very hard and even with a curve applied. I got a's and b's in every class but his.,0
"It's one of those classes where it's supposedly an easy class, but it just isn't. She makes the assignments much more difficult than they actually are, and the instructions are never clear. She's a nice person, she just isn't clear at all which makes her class difficult.",0
"Poole is one of the best uOttawa professors! She is very understanding and makes so much time for her students outside of class. She also teaches very well and thoroughly and truly understands what she's talking about. She gets a bad rap because she challenges her students, but I have taken 4 courses with her and I have learned so much from her.",1
"I really enjoyed Lalondes class and he makes it really fun to attend because he finds interesting videos or clips that help you understand the content better. This class was ALL tests and maybe a few other assignments, but the tests were also fair and had no surprises. He told you exactly what would be on the exam beforehand too",1
"This class consists of 2 papers, a midterm, and a final. The TAs graded the first paper super hard, but were much more lenient on the second. Midterm and final are really easy. Professor Kim is very clear during lecture. I recommend taking notes on your laptop instead of writing them down because he talks really fast!",1
"Had a hard time getting through the readings when i took his class, however looking back on it and re-reading some of the things we went over in that class. Dr. Allen really did open new horizons of thought. ",1
"Class description should have included walking through swamps infested with poison ivy, being eaten alive by mosquitoes, developing neck/back problems carrying around 30pd bags for hours, walking in the middle of thunderstorms, finger problems writing for 3-4 hours a day, quizzes where you have to memorize at least 30 species,one had 75. Have fun.",1
"One of the best professors I've had at LSU! Super passionate about his topic, which makes class enjoyable. He really loves what he does and is more than willing to talk to students outside of class. Do the readings and pay attention during the lectures.",1
"This class is hard because Tammie makes it hard. She penalizes students for being unprofessional, but if she makes the same mistake all she says is ""I'm sorry."" She struggles with controlling her attitude when she is unsatisfied. She will have you stressed out about ""to be"" and phrasal verbs rather than the assignments, but even they are stressful.",0
"He doesn't care for students! Didn't do any accommodations during pandemic ""because it's online class, we continue as planned"". Poor lectures, just reads slides and puts up recording. You have to teach everything yourself, tests are 5x harder than review, and no curve. Homework is mostly theory and statements, while exam is only problems. GPA Kill",0
"At the beginning of the WWI course he guarantees you an A if you follow his rules: read books, watch videos and attend class.  He doesn't use Blackboard, return emails quickly, or return homework with feedback.   You won't know how you are doing until he gives you your final grade.   2 exams, 1 homework assignment and 1 extra credit opportunity.",1
She always gives so many homework questions and she takes them up as part of your points with your quiz grades. There are quizzes at the beginning of almost every class and she only gives 10 minutes for them. She takes off points for the SMALLEST & STUPIDEST things. She will be the reason you'll fail the class or drop out if you're not on top of it,0
"Dr. Laflin doesn't really interact with the class, by more so her TA does, being Mr. Burkett. Burkett is wonderful and provides excellent feedback. You have weekly readings and projects (not hard at all though). No quizzes. 3 exams all semester. Do the work and you will get an A. Lots of extra credit as well.",1
This class is very difficult. 30 seconds to answer a question on lab exams so its basically you know it or you don't. She's really hard on the students and makes the excuse that if we want to go to the medical field you need to be able to do well under pressure. I would say this class messes with you mental health.,0
Dr. V is such a positive role model whom I myself look up too amongst many more other students. I have never met such a caring understanding loving person let alone a professor like Dr. V. I LOVE how she makes a person feel so comfortable and loved. I can only speak for myself and from my experience with Dr.V. I would definitely recommend her.,1
"Before i had this professor i didnt think it was possible to get a ""bad"" teacher.nope. this guy is really bad.If you must take him read the textbook his ""lectures"" seem to be based off of them. he goes through no examples just theory but his tests are about 50% quantitative so try problems in book for practice as well as obscure definitions.",0
Basically don't get on his bad side and you're fine. He's super easy to talk to and will help/explain anything you don't understand.,1
"Please avoid if u can. You will dread coming to the class, and then leave gaining no knowledge. Waste of time & money to say the least.",0
"Seems to be a really easy going instructor. If you read the textbook and his thoughts to ponder, you can pass this class with no problem. ",1
"she is giving us a test on thursday and a final on tuesday. pshh. what the crap is that. ha, i guyess it doesn't matter but i will cry anyways.",0
"No book needed, I purchased my coloring text book and never used it, instead I focused on the reviews youll see online throughout the course. Make flash cards and STUDY STUDY STUDY! Those flash cards and you will make As on all of them.",1
"Most of us were intimidated on the first day until we got to know her. This instructor was amazing, you had to work for your grade but you learned a lot. Feedback was very helpful.",1
Did things to cover all you would need to know but if you aren't a woman then he doesn't seem to pay attention to you as much for answering questions or suggestions.,1
This class was alot of fun. He makes the lectures fun to listen to and easy join. Tell lots of stories that relate to the topic at hand. He's there to teach not too grade so showing up and participating are a sure way to pass yhe class with an A or B.,1
Definetly not reccommended. Very vague in what he wants and rarely offers any valuable input for improvement. How you do well in his class is beyond me. Not all approachable and very rarely interesting. Would avoid at all costs,0
"By far Professor Lee is one of the best teachers I've ever had. His class is fun, challenging, and never ever boring! He really cares about teaching and is always helpful to students. His class is well-planned and he teaches in ways that make me really enjoy going to his class... All in all, I would recommend his class to anyone.",1
"Super amazing guy, someone you will learn a bunch from!",1
"He assigns 5 papers, each about 3-5 pages, a final project (5 pages max), and 4 exams. The papers were alright and I'm sure he didn't even read them, just automatic 100, so I don't know why he makes us do the work. The exams are multiple choice but you have to read the book, even if you do they're really specific and only gave us 1:20 for 50 questi",0
He is a very nice guy. The class is relatively easy. They expect you to learn it on the essential calculus application though. The material is not really taught in any of the math classes. They more just expect you to learn it yourself. Nice guy though and is definitely willing to help if you ask.,1
SHE IS TERRRRIBLE!!!!!I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND TAKING HER FOR ENGLISH..EVER!,0
"Unclear instructions given for projects. She is unwilling to help if you are having difficulty understanding. She taught a color theory class without using color, she would only verbally describe projects. She did not enforce any deadlines, so most students did not have their work done for critiques and she would critique unfinished projects.",0
"The class is largely based on a group project (interviews). Tests are very easy! He does not assign any homework outside of the group project material. Really nice guy, tries his best to help everyone to pass!",1
"Vannier is a cool dude, but makes you work for your grade. 3 exams total, all pretty hard but gives you a serious amount of extra credit (like around 40 points) so makes it pretty fair. Takes attendance by having you do worksheets during class so don't skip a lot. Our homework was online quizzes, time consuming but easy (a lot of answers online)",1
"Worst teacher Ive ever take in my life. Strict on grading, no matter how hard you try he will always find some problem to lower your grade. WORST TEACHER EVER",0
BEST PROFESSOR OF MY FRESHMAN YEAR. He is so funny and really cares if his students are understanding what he teaches. He is clearly very passionate about economics and presents the concepts in an extremely clear and digestible way. No homework if you take notes on the lectures and open notes for all assessments. 10/10 would recommend no question.,1
"Pat is actually a really smart teacher, when you're taking his course you will feel it cause you'll not be able to understand what's going on at the most time (maybe because I'm not smart enough). The midterm worthed a big percentage, and there're totally different things in his assignments. Anyway, happy to say goodbye :)",0
"Worst teacher ever, if you want to fail take him. But if you want to succeed and get a good grade stay away.",0
Robyn Proud is an AMAZING professor here at SUNY Oswego.  As an education major she is a must have!  I had her as a 3 hour night class professor and she made the class time fly by.  She in engaging and really cares about all her students.  She has effective teaching experience and is always willing to share with her class.  ,1
"she's nice but not very lenient. you must show up to class and do work on time or tough luck. the lectures weren't too long, there are quizzes every new topic with a few questions but they were not extremely hard. the final was about 20-25 questions as the normal test length for this class and she gives partial credit. take her class",1
Right now i just took het midterm which i know i failed and i have to find a way to drop this class. Guys im not saying shes a bad person or something shes nice as a person but shes very hard if u want A its not gonna be easy there are other professors who teach socy 240 very easy so i suggest dont take her ,0
Awful professor very push along kind of guy not very interested in a student personal success as opposed to maintaining his goofy persona. If you are a serious dancer take another professors class...,0
"This class was extremely confusing to me. I asked for help couple of times but only gained more confusion. Bases your grade on the class avg. so grading is not too bad. However, I wish I did not take this class. Just be alert if you are going to take it!",0
Cares more then any teacher I've ever met.,1
"He is absolutely brilliant and expects such brilliance in return. His assignments are challenging and though his marking is difficult, it is fair considering what you are able to take away from his lectures. The effort he asks of you as a student will benefit you in all other English classes. You will walk away from his class feeling accomplished.",1
If you read the books you will pass. ,1
"Julien for eon 102 was a waste of time. First and only live class was a disaster of random questions and him having no lecture plan. after the first week it was very unclear on what mindtap readings and assignments were to be done. Besides that first lecture he did not teach, only assignments and short videos which weren't super helpful.",0
"tests are way harder than they should be for a gen ed. makes you work with pre-assigned groups multiple times a year, which can be good or bad depending on your group.",0
Professor Fan is an amazing professor! She repeats herself a lot but it's to make sure that you understand what she's teaching and it's LIKELY that the things she repeats are going to be on the exams. HW is easy. She offers study guides so do them! Offers 4% of extra credit. Not a tough grader when it comes to the case study.,1
"I don't think Scanlon is as bad as everyone says he is. Fair grader and if you put work into the course you will do fine. Attendance is ""mandatory"" but he only takes it every few lectures. I didn't have to go gung-ho last year in this class, but still managed to get an A.",1
"This class is so difficult that sometimes not even the Professor gets it; even though he wrote the book. It has nothing to do with philosophy, it has nothing to do with anything. He basically gives you a sentence, & wants you to break it down. IT'S NOT EASY, BELIEVE ME. You have to attend class; HW on Tue., Short Quiz on Thur. Big Quiz on Friday",0
very very helpful. gives every phone number possible out to students and u can reach her at anytime. gives you notes and goes over them in class. lots of hw but its so worth it. i learned so much from that class. she expects a-lot from her students but shes great,1
"If you are taking SOWK4650 to fill a requirement for the social work program, I would suggest picking another class. This professor was condescending and very unclear about what they wanted to see for assignments. I do not feel that I learned much of anything in this class.",0
"He is nice and sometimes makes funny remarks. He teaches lectures (over 100 people) with Powerpoints and brings guests speakers along. The Powerpoints are not really specific and don't contain much information but the info on the slides are the same as in the textbook. As long as you read the textbook, all the information should be there.",1
"Prof. Rafferty is a good wake up call for an 8 am class. She's funny, extremely nice and helpful, and makes learning fun. I've found a great kindred spirit to come to for questions about any kind of physics, and she's really lenient with some grades. She's always willing to help, and I would absolutely recommend taking her for PHYS101.",1
"Takes off for spelling mistakes if you don't close your a's. Otherwise, he'll think you spelled Indiu instead of India..",0
"He was the best professor I have ever had! He's very funny, and he always successfully engages his students. He's very understanding if you need extensions or extra clarification. Lectures aren't necessary to attend, but he is the best lecturer the University has to offer. I will take anything offered by him in the future! I recommend this class! ",1
Professor Konya graded way too harshly and doesn't seem to care if a huge percentage of his class is failing or has to withdraw to not get an F. He takes off so many points for tiny things. I definitely advise against ever taking his classes!,0
"She did not giv clear instructions, and she graded whether she like you or not. In the syllabus she stated that it did not matter how you did grade wise on your papers and test it was all up to here",0
She is Awful! She told our class that we could not ask questions during class because she had to many slides to go through. She mows through 150 slides on average a day. Rediclous,0
"Dr. Ingram is a good man, that I will not argue. However, his lectures can be hard to follow and contain a strong bais in favor of his own political views. If you disagree with those views in your essays, you may not do as well as others.",0
"This is the worst teacher ever.  He not only puts the program to shame, he also puts the fire service to shame. Makes many mistakes. Has multiple incorrect answers on tests. Doesn't give feedback and so on. If you are looking to become a firefighter, please do not take him.",0
"Awful. Didn't grade anything and gave tons of lengthy weekly assignments.. at the end of the semester I had 4 recorded grades. 95 95 87 74 I ended up with a B.. I did over 20 assignments (essays, projects, quizzes) I have no idea how my grade was calculated.",0
"Professor Silva is one of the best professors I have ever had. I have taken this class before, and failed so i was terrified to take it again. Mr. Silva made a difficult subject very manageable and I actually enjoyed coming to his classes. He is funny and always willing to help his students. There is a lot of homework but it helps you understand!",1
"Tests are longer, harder and prof's expectations to students are higher.",0
"She is a tough grader, but very fair, helpful and entertaining.  She gives out written study guides, before each test, that divulge her exact game-plan; then she gives an optional review session; and then she lets you use a personal note-card CHEAT SHEET during the test.  Put in a little work and she more than meets you half way.  I love her.",1
"Extremely knowledgeable of networking, and patient to all the various levels that come through his class. We did hands on while learning concepts, and then he built on, step by step, in a very organized way. His approach is much clearer than cisco material. Genuinely wants students to learn and do well in class, and later in job.",1
"Prof. Bartl doesn't waste his student's time or money. I'm usually bored with my other online courses, but the readings in this class were interesting.",1
Jim has a lot of experience and wisdom to offer. It was difficult for me to keep track of assignments this semester and it would be helpful if he used blackboard. Group activities weren't really taken seriously and took up a big block of the semester. It was hard for me to care about the assignments and class in part because of the groups.,1
"This lady has no idea how to teach. She makes you put an absurd amount of work into her class and expects everyone to just know things without her telling us or to figure it out ourselves. Shes not the worst, but she wasnt my cup of tea",0
"I love Dr. Haspel. I had him for three classes while he taught at CCCC. ENG 111, ENG 112, and Critical Thinking. He genuinely cares about his students, and goes out of his way to make sure his students are enjoying what they learn. He also goes out of his way to make sure his students succeed.",1
"I was lucky that the majority of the class was online. She ""taught"" in class but all of the homework, quizzes and tests were online. I only went to class once a week because we had a lab. If it were't for the class being online I would have failed miserably. I do not recommend her unless you want to teach yourself.",0
"Pell is a nice person and is helpful and easy to reach via email, however she is the hardest prof, AVOID IF YOU CAN.  2 sets of homework due every sunday at midnight and they can be really long.  I strongly recommend you find a study group to help with the homework because they are alot different from what you do in class.  EXAMS ARE HARD",0
"Ms. Pena is a great professor. She's a little on the young side but she connects well with her students. She gives you the option to buy either the online or physical book. You have one group presentation but it's fun because you get to choose your subject. Make sure to play close attention to everything, especially the pop quizzes. Final was easy.",1
"She is really great, shes fun, really smart and teaches a lot but doesnt give much work. Expect to get let out about half an hour early, shes super laid back and it wasnt a huge deal if you missed a couple classes she always posted the notes. Like i said almost no work just study for mid terms and finals. Really enjoyed her class.",1
"This was his first semester at PSU Abi, and I really enjoyed his class. I thought it would be an easy Natural Sciences cred. You do have to work for it, and study, but its worth it. I believe we only had 3 exams, maybe 4, don't remember, and he helped you get ready for him. Aside from that, he's also super funny and easy to talk to. Cool guy",1
"Very helpful and always accessible. Always gives good and positive feedback.  If you have a passion for Math, you will definitely enjoy every single class with him",1
"A bit dense, but cool examples really simplify the theories. Instructor gives very detailed feedback on assignments which allowed me to improve a lot!",1
What a dick.,0
Weeks will go by before you get your graded work back & then w/no clear guidance as to what you did wrong/how to fix it. Syllabus not clear (but in a late graded paper she stated she will not READ anything with more than 200 words). She set up a MTG & didn't even show up on time. She is rude and extremely short when speaking to you. I rate her F+,0
What I love most about Mr. Seals is that he makes sure you understands and grasp the problems. I wouldn't take anyone else!,1
"Amazing professor! Really cool guy who's available any time you wanna speak with him via phone or email. His lectures are great, especially if you're into religious studies. Entertaining and interesting during lecture too! No tests for this class, only quizzes and papers, so additional plus if you dislike tests. Fantastic instructor! Thanks Dr.L!",1
"He was not clear on what he wanted done, therefore the majority of the class including myself kept getting bad grades. Then when you would try to get a hold of him he would not respond in a timely manner nor answer our phone calls. Do not take this class with this professor unless you want to fail.",0
"This man is the best PE teacher ever. You can hardly show up to class and you will get an A. He is very helpful, he will work with you to improve your skills. Nice, funny, and caring. Take him if you have the chance. He is the best!",1
"I took this class online and the requirements for the course were incredibly clear from day one. Four assignments due a week, for each chapter, none of which were horribly difficult. Read the chapter, do the assignments, and you should be fine. Professor responds to emails promptly provided the answer hasn't already been answered prior. Easy class.",1
"I dont know about these ratings but, she required online text which was highly expensive and ridiculous and weekly quizzes. Pointless to go class but yet she takes role. Mostly for under division students. Overall, very bubbly personality",0
"If you come in to this class thinking its going to be an easy A, then you won't like it. But its college and there comes a time when you classes won't be so easy. Do the work, come to class, participate, and you do fine. She talks a lot, but its to benefit her students. Overall i think anyone is capable of passing, and do well in this class.",1
She is a good at accounting but not necessarily teaching but she can be rude sometimes especially if you're late or aren't showing up. I would not take again.,1
"This was by far my favorite class. I took this class as a Freshman and I loved it. He is super nice guy and definitely knows what he is doing. He is always willing to stop what he is doing and help someone.  He goes over problems EXACTLY like they appear on the tests. Pay attention, take notes, ask questions.",1
"Chandra is the worst professor I have ever had at umb. Physics is a difficult subject to begin with and 90% of the class are not physics majors yet his expectations for us are ridiculously high. 2 midterm and a final, midterms consist of 2 questions, so if you get one question wrong you fail. Endless amounts of homework not even related to lecture.",0
She taught me in FRSL 102. She was really considerate. She went over the quizzes and can8. Expect lots of homework and time dedication to the course. Amazing professor tho!,1
She is one of the sweetest teachers in the nursing department at MATC. She has a lot of experience and knowledge. Her discussions are helpful and she does reviews before the exam that focus on key points. You have to be prepared for class and have to read. I would take her again. ,1
"I received an ""A"", but the course was still terrible. He changed around assignment dates and his exams were utterly confusing. To illustrate this point, the 'Questions for the Instructor"" discussion thread had over 200 posts by the end of the semester because all 25 students had no idea what Dr. K. was expecting on his exams. Frustrating. ",0
"Dr. Bailey has been my favorite professor thus far. Really funny, super helpful, and easy-going.",1
"This prof  is for sure the best I've had in the Police foundations diploma.  She is approachable, frienldy, and seriously cares about students.  She has very clear boundaries and you will do well if you work within them.  Her police experience makes it fun to learn in her class.  I would take again for sure.",1
"I took his class because I had no other option. This professor does not help you at all and expects you to do things by yourself. He does not teach any programming expects how to calculate sum of two numbers and basic stuff. He makes alot of mistakes and says, "" I am not like other profs whk prepare their lectures at home. I do everyrhing here.""",0
"If this is the guy I'm thinking of, he's a boring dolt who was always complaining about **** college student puking on his lawn.  He used to hand out candy though.  That was the only high point of the class.",0
Terrible attitude toward students. Unprofessional. Severely unorganized. I would avoid this professor completely.,0
Not recommended at all.,0
I was told by Mike that I should consider changing my major and he was insanely harsh in his grading. He never encouraged me or worked with me and everything I did was wrong. Ive had 3000+ level classes that were easier.,0
"Dale is extremely educated. If you want to learn how to interpret, take his visual linguistics analysis of interpreting class.  However, oh dale, too much time talking about himself, looking at his facebook page, calling his friends during class so they can tell us stories about him...etc.  On topic he is great, it just didnt happen that often.",1
He is the worst teacher.,0
"His a good professor really funny, pretty chill and will help you develop your projects,really good feedback and is there for you to ask questions. Cares about your work he wants to see improvement and thought, and will call out if people are slacking. Feels a little useless to come to class sometimes but overall, great teacher, funny, good class",1
"Gives you outdated power points,  doesn't allow pics of current ones, Goes through them fast & hard to catch up. She puts things on test that she doesn't go over/ makes them difficult on purpose,Makes you do pointless labs that are confusing & unhelpful to the subject. Miss one test & it is literally impossible to catch up again. WORST TEACHER EVER",0
"He is such a smart guy. He is very well-spoken. A lot of ppl in my class didn't like the class because his teaching style are power points and pictures, and he just talks. But i thought it was such an interesting class! You analyze advertising, logos, signs, architecture. Very interesting. I took him again fro Art and History. same teaching style.",1
He loves the sound of his own voice. Take another professor if you really wanna learn stats,0
"Easy A. Group presentations that are very simple. Follow her speech outlines and you will pass. Not that nerve-wrecking when you realize everyone around you is presenting and self conscious too. Tests are pretty easy if you look over the book once, other than that didn't use it. Super sweet lady. I recommend this as a Comm GE.",1
"prof gilbert is awesome at what he does. not only is the topic interesting to begin with, but he makes it come to life.. he really knows what he's talking about. more importantly, what he talks about really makes you think. and isn't that what higher education is all about? but be prepared to do some MAD writing for the exams!totally worth it tho!",1
"Worst professor in modern history. Teaching is just not for her. She made up an imaginary periodic table for exams, she doesnt care at all. Im begging every student do not take her classes if you want to learn and pass. She is just awful. I wished I read the comments before taking her class. Absolutely do not waste your time and money with her.",0
"Dr. H is a great professor and super easy going! This class is very lecture-heavy and a lot of reading but she makes it pretty interesting. Be aware that if you take Anth 360 you'll have to do 15 hours of applied projects, but these weren't bad.",1
"I highly suggest to not take Dr. Bush pre-calc online course! Unless you are okay to teach yourself about this course with ""0"" lecture. The only way I could learn something was by doing the homework. Nothing more than that was ever offered. Theres 2 exams and no extra credit! Actually there was 5 points* thanks Wendy! but srly, do not take her!!!",0
I wouldn't recommend him if you aren't naturally good at math. Nobody attends class because going isn't very beneficial (I also had him at 8 am). I taught myself all the material and ended up doing pretty well. Go to class every Friday and study and you should be fine. Be prepared to teach yourself though.,0
"Eric is a nice enough guy but he makes all of the students go up to the white board and do problems. Not only is this juvenile, almost mid school like, he does not give us time to write things down in our notes, because we are ALWAYS up at the board. He also, constantly makes technical errors constantly.",0
"Professor Peters was an amazing professor for intro to psychology. Her class was not the easiest course, but it was by no means extremely difficult. For every exam, she is clear on what content is going to be on it. If you are unsure of anything, she always responds to emails to clarify. She is a very genuine and caring professor. TAKE HER!!",1
"I ENROLLED IN THIS CLASS 6/29/2011 FOR SUMMER B SESSION. I READ REVIEWS WRITTEN BUT DECIDED TO TAKE A CHANCE. BOY I WISH I HAD LISTENED I STAYED IN CLASS FOR TEN MINUTES AND HURRIED TO DROP. PROFESSOR WAS ALL OVER THE PLACE, FAST SPEED AYOU COULD NOT UNDERSTAND ONE WORD SHE WAS SAYING... HOW DO EDISON EXPECT YOU TO LEARN LIKE THIS!! DONT TAKE HER!",0
"Class is mandatory, if you miss class you do not receive your points for showing up so make sure you sign the attendance sheet upon class even if late sign it!! She has a bad attitude and asking a question(s) is pointless. Quizzes are kind of tough! Final project is worth whole grade, and its a group project!",0
"She was very good at teaching Cryptography. I had her for five courses during my Kettering career and I never had the problems that others seem to have. She's very nice and she always does a good job at teaching algorithms. I had absolutely no problem learning cryptography from her, she made the algorithms very clear.",1
"When I first arrived here I took her class and did not pass. She expects a lot of reading and a lot of participating. Although I got a NP, her class was very interesting to me because it had to do a lot with the Latin culture! Honestly don't take her class if you have the chance.   ",0
"I loved her!  She really makes people comfortable, high energy, and you do improve.  I hated giving speeches prior to this, but by the end I was a lot more comfortable.  Some people don't like her much cause she can be a little hippy, but its really not enough to become annoying.  She's very easy to talk to, and one of my favorite teachers!",1
"I had Sander for Bio 108 lab. Extremely tough grader and not clear on material. She is not very clear on feedback. While she is a very nice person (I liked her personally but not professionally) I would not have her as a lab instructor again. On a positive note, she was very willing to help during non-test labs.",0
"I really liked him.  He was much better then a lot of the other 201 teachers.  He gets pumped about accouting which is cool if you like that sort of thing and he really is such a nice guy.  The tests aren't bad, you need to keep up with the homework but I feel like thats true with 201 no matter what.  I got a 3.7 and didn't work all that hard.",1
"Steve is amazing. He takes a legitimate interest in his students and he's super passionate about Classics. He sincerely wants his students to succeed, and if you put effort into any of his classes he will make sure you pass, but in all honesty he doesn't make his classes hard at all. He's awesome; I recommend him for every class you can take.",1
"She is horrible. I would not take this professor even if it means waiting a quarter or two for the right professor. She is rude, unhelpful, answers students in a pretentious manner, and seems like she could care less for the students. I genuinely do not like her. ",0
"The material on the exams are not based on understanding, but on stupid memorization.  He also injects his political and religious views into a chemistry class--no small feat.  He is extremely arrogant.",0
"Terrible teacher! He made everyone in the class hate math. Worse teacher ever, if you have the chance to choose do NOT take him. He thinks he is funny, and his jokes suck.",0
"Miller is great. He is very dedicated to his profession and a fun teacher. Very open to students ideas and I actually learned a lot about different styles of poetry, I disagree with all of the negative comments this is probably the only class that does not put me to sleep. TAKE THIS CLASS.",1
"Her first test in bio 101 is just to make kids drop her class its extremely hard, her lab is insane and she makes the midterm harder than the other lab teachers, She is never in her office during office hours, get ready to study if you take her class, take maxwell instead..... Dr. Hinton is really nice and funny but her tests are insane.",0
"Take this professor if you wan't to become any form of a writer or poet. If that is not you, avoid this guy's class. He does not care for any reason or excuse you may have for missing a class or doing something in a way he doesn't want done. I was one of 3 kids who passed with a C or better out of a class that began w 30-40 students. Good luck",0
"This class was no joke. He does not lecture and you are expected to read and know the material before class. There are four exams and a final, all of which were very difficult. It is possible to get an A but you have to really work for it. Go to SI, ask questions, study with your classmates, and DO ALL HW AND MOCK EXAMS! Do this and you'll pass :)",1
"Took her for Psy2012 she's super nice! If you hate people with an accent do not take her... lol she has a really bad accent but i really enjoyed her class! I took her 6 week class and unless your good at writing essays do not take the 6 week with her, its way too fast! but overall  her class was pretty easy.. notes are extremely important!",1
"Nice guy but horrible teaching method. I had to drop the class because I fell way behind. Hes alwars confused, and its hard to follow along because he is really boring. He does try to lighten up the class by going off topic here and there.",0
DO NOT TAKE HIM!! I took the 8 week online class and asked for help with the Excel project and got no response. I emailed him 4 times and got a response that did not explain anything. Way more than just the usual computer stuff. I get all A's in my classes but will be lucky to get a C.,0
"Triggs was brand new to TCC and did her best to work with us and adjusted due dates around theory. The hospital experience was not great but she did what she could to make it work for everyone. I learned a lot from her and hope TCC will keep her on staff full time. She's fairly laid back and funny, def recommend. Has a lot of stories to share.",1
He is not helpful and the exams are very hard and often do not apply to things that we do in class.,0
"There is busy work, but not difficult at all. Keep up on your assignments and submit ON TIME. Easy A. The textbook was ""mandatory"" but I never opened it.",1
"If you don't come from a reading heavy or history background her class can be really tough, since you could be assigned 100+ pages per class. Her lectures were clear and even when they went off track were still relevant and interesting to the course. I thought she was a great lecturer, but be prepared to work hard for a good grade.",1
"Took this course online. I missed the test twice because of misreading the syllabus both times she reopened it for me. Four test, post a discussion once a week and one project.  I would highly recommend taking this class online.  Easy A and good exercises and information in Medical Terminology.  Couldnt have been happier with this class!",1
"GM is an even tempered folksy adjunct whose lectures are a walk through the textbook examples. Minimal mandatory homework & detailed preview of what to expect on tests means no surprises. He is available for help before & after class, in math lab, or by home phone. He does his best to accommodate late additions. I don?t know how this gets better.",1
"What she teaches in class is interesting, however she sometimes she does put you on the spot. Her tests have NO relation to what is taught in class. Seems to have little direction in her lectures (no wonder she hates power points).",0
"Do not take this class. 40+ pages to read, 3 tests, 3 quizzes, a 30 minute video and discussion board EVERY WEEK. This was the hardest class I have ever taken and it doesn't get easier. He's a nice guy, but a harsh grader. I am a strong writer and managed a borderline A in the class. This is a GPA killer unless you are dedicated!",0
I had professor Mathis for poetry and I had a solid B the whole semester(because only grade were the daily worksheets ) until our first test 12 weeks into the semester she grades unrealistic on the paper I got an F because I didnt meet the page requirement. When I went back to redo it I was literally 2 sentences away getting an A in rare,0
"Dr. Cooper is a new and young professor. He is normally a physics guy so he probably wasn't too happy to have to teach calc. There are two 20 point tests with 6 questions each. 2 easy, 2 medium, 2 hard (usually). If you worked hard in calc in HS you should be fine. I did no work and got a B. Big curve bc of low averages and extra credit at the end.",1
"While his lectures were excellent and he knows his study, Mr Schlortt seemed vague and inconsistent in his feedback on papers and took off points from every minuscule mistake imaginable. His quizzes and ""cartoon analyses"" are extremely rushed in class (he hangs over you if you haven't finished in 5 or 10 minutes) and rigorously graded.",0
"He is easy. You will pass, but he is EXTREMELY rude. If you are in the class to actually learn, forget it. He will tell you the answer and if you ask why, he will say don't worry about it. If you just want to pass with an A or B, take his class. If you actually want to learn, don't.",0
Her class is extremely interesting.  I have learned so much from her.,1
"You are expected to learn hundreds of pages worth of music history in one week then you are tested. She never once taught. We learned from youtube videos. You are required to go to 5, yes FIVE, musical events and write a paper over each. There was also listening sections where you had to recognize tedious things about songs. WORST PROF EVER.",0
"The lectures drag on forever, and even if you can keep paying attention throughout, they won't help much with the homework or tests anyway. She clearly understands the material very well, but is either not good at explaining it or doesn't bother to fully explain it. Her accent is also very hard to understand, but you get used to that after a while.",0
This man is very sweet but very out of touch. Online teaching is definitely not his format of choice. He rambles a lot and I found myself doing better by not attending lectures.,0
"This is my first time reviewing a professor here, but Prof. Paul's class was one of the best experiences I have had at APU. If you EVER have the chance to take a class from him, DO IT. You will not regret it. So much musical knowledge gained this past semester. He's not too difficult, but you learn SO MUCH.",1
Marlow is a very good english teacher but hes hard as hell!!  He expects the best out of you and expects you to have your work on time.  You have four major papers and the first two are fairly easy.  The last two are research papers and they get somewhat hard esp the last one.  He will have you ready for your next three years of college. Great guy!,1
"GOD! Forget about this professor! They say he is smart, but....Please, please, please do a favor to yourself and DO NOT DARE to take him. Never available and never replies to e-mails!",0
"For the love of all things, don't take this class with him...",0
"I have only been taking his class for 2 weeks, so I may be biased but here is my opinion. I dont like this professor very much because hes not very helpful when you want answers to how your assignments are recorded or graded on McGraw and many times, I felt confused with his answers. Im doing my best to do well in his class, but he doesnt care.",0
Not a good teacher at all,0
"Dr. Kennedy is an ok prof.  He is often not clear with expectations on exams and gets angry if you leave class for your next one in ten minutes when he is not finished, even if class has technically ended 4 minutes ago. Sometimes can come off a bit sarcastic as well. Lab is good with him though.",0
"He is pretty entertaining when he teaches, and really into what he teaches. Pretty funny and super cute.",1
"pleasant person, but bad teacher - i get that she wants to be the interactive type but she really, really just needs to get through the material and lecture sometimes. you can do the reading but you'll never know what you thought was wrong because she just doesn't cover all the material in a consistent manner if at all, then boom, it's on the test",0
Dr. Beckman is by far the most engaged professor that I have ever studied under in regards to passion for the curriculum and also the students he teaches.,1
Alvarez is an excellent professor that is genuinely more interested in your learning than your ability to turn in a paper. Her topics are extremely interesting and I'd recommend taking a class with her. ,1
"The professor knows his stuff, its just a hard class because not everyone is in the same level some topics you might talk more about then others depending on how the class is. He does give an excessive amount of homework about 50 or 60 problems a week. If you get the homework the test would be a breeze because thats what he uses to make the test.",1
"I took Professor Ford's MUS110 class just to earn the credit. I'm not a super big fan of music and I didn't think that this class would be that hard. For an elective class, there is honestly way too much work. You also have to be careful about deadlines or you'll miss assignments completely. It wasn't the worst class, but I wouldn't take it again.",0
bates is freaking hilarious. great teacher and have learned a lot.,1
"She's extremely dry, but a good professor because of her knowledge of the material.  She can be tough but like all accountants, has no sense of humor or personality.  ",1
"I learnt a lot from this professor. Gives assignments and home works which helps you to learn. Passionate about teaching and cares if students grasped all the concepts. His exams are challenging but if you listen to his class, learn from his notes and homework assignments you will do well.",1
Don't take online. Mandatory 2 hour chats that are hard to get in to and hard to find time for. 4 weekly quizzes. Plus a discussion weekly. 4 papers. He also gave out an extra credit filed trop assignment less than 24 hours ahead of time making it impossible to make time for.,0
He is the toughest grader I have ever taken. He gives a lot of homework and is really tough on the specific details required in your answer. He is the hardest teacher I have taken. There is a lot of drawings and answering questions.,0
GREAT professor. Explains how to adjust in a very clear and concise manner.,1
If you're looking to make money shooting weddings...then he knows what he's talking about. Anything else...I'd go to someone else for advice.,1
"Easy but boring class. Just sit in the front, laugh at his jokes and act interested and you'll pass. Hes a really sweet guy, though he tends to go on and on about Ghana. His lessons can seem a little scattered but he always gives study guides. No reason to get less than a B.",1
"Demanding, but the very best in regard to getting an education in English.",1
"Her teaching style did not match my learning style and when I started working, I realized that I had a lot of holes in education. She would have is read articles with a class discussion that didn't always correlate with each other. Those discussions and reading weren't really reflected on the essay test questions.",0
Not a huge fan of her. She is very uninterested when you approach her with specific questions or are in need of help. Her midterm was nearly impossible. I studied all the lectures/notes I took in class and readings for hours and hours & still did not know 80% of the questions on the exam. She assigns SUCH long readings and there are always quizzes,0
"I would not recommend her for online. There are only 2-3 assignments you have to complete, so you are completely relying on the lectures for when you get to the tests. She also talks very soft which makes watching her lectures online almost impossible. She grades very strictly as well.",0
"He goes over his notes very fast and most of the time you can't read what they say, but he explains every thing that is on the board and is a pretty good teacher.",1
Super chill! Took his hybrid class which was worth it. The usual writing class their are assignments due  and brad makes it easy to understand. In class and out of class you will do reading journals total of 6 and paper assignments that you have to be uploaded to turntin and peer reviewed . He doesn't demand a lot beside those. Do the work & A++.,1
"Martin does NOT follow the syllabus at all. She stopped following it the second week of classes. She cancels class often and does not grade papers on time. It took her way too long to grade three major papers and prompts aren't clear. For the self reflective essay assignment, she didn't assign it until a week before the end of the semester.",0
"Dr. Witelski is an awesome professor, and a great guy. He's always there to answer emails/questions in office hours. His class is extremely hard, but you can see the common thread of the class from beginning to end. The course is well designed and well kept, and I learned a ton in it.",1
"This course earned my first C in my 3 year college career.  Teacher would make us do hw and take tests before ever teaching the subject, which she thought was a hot new teaching method, so the only reason to take the class was for the weekly quizzes, because after that you would not learn anything new. Reading the book was the only way to learn.",0
"Outstanding instructor. Knows her stuff, and very dedicated to the success of her students.  ",1
Quizes and Homework are totally different from whatever he taught in class. I litterally only leanred from textbook and the Internet. Not recommending him for this course.,0
He is bilingual and often very hard to understand. He gets himself confused a lot. Must show up every Friday for a quiz or a mandatory activity. The quizzes look just like the packets that you have to print out. He is very nice and always willing to help students when they get confused. You get a cheat sheet for every quiz and two for the final.,0
"Easy if youve seen basic physics before, but beware this is a modelling class, so lots of drawings, and the class is very slow",1
"Howell expects a lot of work for a one unit course. He isn't very helpful and gets fairly hostile when irritated. Most of your grade is from lab reports, which are quite long (expect to spend several hours per week writing these up) and minor mistakes will lose you a lot of points. The tests are easy but don't make up much of your grade.",0
Professor explains the concepts clearly and his projects provide the students with a chance to explore all the concepts and algorithms. Learnt a lot in this course. Homeworks and Projects help you understand the concepts clearly and also allow you to experiment with different ideas. Excellent Professor would love to take other courses under him.,1
Dr. Thompson is a fantastic professor. His lectures are very clear. He has individual meetings with students after exams so you always have an idea of where you stand grade-wise which is rare for science courses. The material is incredibly hard. He makes his own problem sets and that's the most useful study material.,1
"Well, she's a smart individual and you can tell that she's a good chemist. However teaching is not for her, it doesn't mean if you're good at something that you're automatically good at teaching it, probably research is her play ground but NOT teaching. Get ready to be your own tutor!!",0
"There is literally an assignment due every class day, from essays to paragraphs to literally anything you can think of. Honestly entirely too much work. If you have a class that needs extra attention DO NOT take this class.",0
the information was easy to understand and apply but the test just seemed complete 180° from the quizzes and homework,0
Easily the worst professor I have EVER had here in my time at Temple. Completely arrogant in many regards. Sees the world in his perspective and if you do not agree with him your wrong.  Worst books I have ever had to read for a class. DO NOT TAKE!!!!!,0
"Seems like a nice guy, but good lord, he can't explain things to save his life, and when TA's would try and explain concepts to students that he hadn't conveyed well, he would actually get them in trouble because he was the course chair. Terribly run class, do not recommend him to anybody.",0
"sounds like someone who did not pass the course last Spring semester got on and tried to repeatedly slam him. He did not even teach the Fall, 2016!",1
"One of the most intelligent professors I've ever had, however, I would not recommend taking him. He plays favorites and if you are not one of them, expect a final grade that doesn't  match your work. Does not offer any help and expects you to accept his interpretations as truth- anything else is incorrect. Don't take him if you can help it.",0
I think this was only her second year teaching ECO100Y1. Her lectures dragged on and her powerpoint slides are directly from the textbook. Her tests are extremely difficult as the tutorial exercises and in-class examples do not prepare you. It also takes forever to get marks back and after 1 month she releases them on New Years Eve.,0
"The course covers a lot a material, so you have to go to class and spend a lot of time reviewing the PowerPoints. The teacher is organized, which helps. Plus, exams are straightforward.",1
Missing grades until the day final grades were due. Unclear grading scales. Required an expensive McGraw Connect when she did not use the software. Unclear deadlines. Stacked assignments. Dropped a student without notice. Doesn't answer emails in any resemblance of a timely matter. Her class was a full time job.,0
"She's tough, rude, and doesn't know how to use a quiet voice. If you did something wrong, the whole class about to know what you did. She also scolds you like you're in elementary school. Get ready to read, and get harsh criticism. She also doesn't always tell you everything that you need to know, or only tells you once. Don't take class with her.",0
Homework has some tough questions that are made harder than they need to be due to the prof only giving one or two examples per topic. He's quite friendly in his office though and can explain things a lot better so definitely utilise those hours.,0
if you're planning on taking this class i'd suggest you find someone else. Ridiculous amount of homework with unrealistic due dates. His lectures are you filling in the blanks and not helpful you're left with more questions than answers. if you ask for help he tells you to go back and read again. take someone else!!!,0
"Every week you have a reading and a response paper (Usually summarizing the reading), the occasional class discussions, he has one or two lectures recorded every week on the reading and theories discussed that week (They are very clear and contain a lot of information). He has a Zoom call to review before tests. GREAT PROFESSOR!!",1
Not so sure if the class (Moral choices) is just easy. We just do discussions and presentations. Homework once a week. Only midterm and final. Open book only for midterm. Just talk and discuss for most of the class. Can be boring and sleepy sometimes but discussions are so fun. Phones are totally restricted in his class***,1
"Great teacher, be prepared to study. She explains things very well but you will have to devote a great deal of time to studying. Her class prepared me very well for other biology classes.",1
Mike is one of my favorites professors in umich. He cares about students and willing to help outside of class. This course really needs hard work especially do a lot of practice questions. When you stuck ask for help right away. Go to the help room! Mike is an amazing professor. Take it with him! Less pain!,1
Great instructor!,1
"Every lecture is like trying to decipher a code. The worst teacher that I have had, always unorganized and unclear. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS",0
"She is way too harsh a grader. She gives assignments for projects and papers, but does not give you any structure for them, just ""do this"". Then she tells you that you did the assignment wrong. I would not recommend her.",0
Not only in college but my entire life hes the worst teacher Ive ever had by far. He sets the class up like a videogame so no one knew what was going on most of the semester. You have to teach yourself through videos. He requires you to get an 80% or better to pass a test or its a 0 and you retake it. If you don't play his games you get nowhere.,0
"Amazing professor. Loves what he teaches. Very approachable. Adds passion to the class and gets to know his students. He loves when you participate though. 3 tests, but super super easy and 3 practicals and other busy work for class. Highly recommend this class and professor.",1
too much assignment and boring . I don't recommend ,0
"This class was a podium for him to spit his political views out. We actually got told that fantasy football is a construct to keep the white man in power over the black man. Don't be fooled by the name of the class, this has very little to do with sports themselves. The second half of this class is an attack on corporate America and how to ""resist""",0
"This was a very interesting class, and I would strongly recommend it for the material you learn...but damn is it needlessly hard. I took this class to fulfill a gen ed requirement to graduate, and I had to sink all of my time just to pull out a B. I learned a lot, but it would help if he at least tried to have the tests follow his lectures.",1
"Death by PowerPoint! Does not care!, Does not teach!, gives vague questions!, doesn't give any feedback! Well you know what they say, if you can't do you teach. Except that makes for a poor teacher!",0
"He can't teach properly. Unnecessarily obfuscates the material.  Doesn't answer questions properly, not helpful in office hour.  His teaching style and method is hugely flawed.",0
"i loved this class. you cannot take this class thinking its easy because if you do not like art, it wont be. i had him for saturdays and we did a lot but of course we only saw him once a week so we had to get a lot done. I guarantee you will find a great improvement in your drawing and painting skills. do not leave things for last minute. trust me.",1
"Mac is honestly one of the best professors I have had in my time at Clark. He is passionate about his job and wants students to succeed. You grade consists of HW, article summaries, and 4 papers. You can work with a partner on all of these. While he was an easy grader, I really learned a lot about topics I was interested in. Amazing class!",1
Don is hilarious. Keeps the class entertained and engaged through his humor and quality lectures.,1
His class is very difficult and was very frustrating. He assigns no homework or review. The only graded assignments are 4 essays and the final. You almost never receive feedback on assignments so it is impossible to know what you did wrong and how to improve at writing. Class started with 32 students. By finals only 7 showed up.,0
"Favorite class at Clark. Super interesting, but there is a lot of reading and you need to study. If you're good with that, then you will be just fine. He curves his exams (or quizzes? can't remember) at the end. This helps your grade a lot. I had a B- the whole quarter and when he curved quizzes/tests & put in our presentation & final, I got an A.",1
"Unreasonable professor. Never gives a clear explanation of what she's looking for in written answers to assignments, so she never gives out A's. If you miss one specific phrase she's looking for you'll miss out on half the points.",0
Very rough professor. Not very understanding to personal issues that may impact class. Do not take,0
"I enjoyed the class and the material, I learned a lot but I worked really hard and didn't do as well as would have liked. The reason is the tests are ridiculously hard, asks very obscure questions, and there is a huge amount of material to study with little direction. Also she said she would curve up the grades for the mid-term but she didn't.",0
"I took her for Multicultural Issues and she was a very good teacher. I would take her over anyone else. Her classes are very short and simple and if you paid attention the tests are easy. Best teacher in the sociology department, i'm surprised more people dont take her",1
"This class is extremely easy. All the homework is online and you can do it as many times as you would like. The actual class time is a lot of youtube and reading the vocabulary words in the specific chapter, so not very helpful. You really have to teach yourself. Tests and quizzes are extremely easy.",0
"(eye roll) this guy is the pits. I took accounting in high school, so I was able to teach  myself plus tutoring. There is no point in going to class, so I stopped going after a while and just did the online homework assignments every week. The tests are easy if you do and understand the homework. Teaches accounting through a terrible online book.",0
"Assignments were easy overall. However, at the end of the semester, he changed his grade breakdown from what the syllabus originally said. His grading was really inconsistent and many students received grades lower than they actually earned. I would avoid this professor for this class.",0
"I took Professor DeLuna for Summer I and Summer II for GOVT2305 and GOVT2306 Online. You definitely need to book. 4 quizzes with 75 questions each, only 75 min. per quiz. I could have benefited from a little more time on the quizzes. No retakes on quizzes or make up work; do not miss a quiz or you will not pass (summer course).",1
Great Professor !! You will learn a lot of interesting things in his classes. Take all of them lol,1
"Dr. Ptak does a great job at getting you to think about the lesson in new and interesting ways - and he's a great, approachable, and caring person too. Class was fun and engaging, and I really learned to think more carefully and analytically about my thought process. That said, I wish the class was more organized and that he graded faster.",1
"This is literally just the best professor I have ever had in my life. There's no exaggeration and I would never say that unless it is actually true. He changed my view of life and helped a lot in giving me directions. I am beyond grateful to him. THE BEST. Makes everyone participate with a camera on. Trust me, taking him is your best choice.",1
Persuaded me to drop the class even though I was clear in fundamentals and had internship experience in solidworks. Very rude if doubts are asked more than twice. Gets easily annoyed. Never guides you towards your career. Monotonous and easily lulls you to sleep. Seems like he has no interest and enthusiasm in passing the knowledge and educating.,0
"She was a very energetic, helpful, and fair teacher.  Some students on here complain about too many surprise quizzes, but they weren't surprises. They are really easy and are every week and there is a lot of extra credit.  Are you gonna believe me or the person who meant ""can not even pronounce certain spanish words incorrectly."" as an insult",1
He is very fair and will help you if you fall behind. He cares about students who care about their work. He is very knowledgeable with software as he worked with a firm that helped create Adbe Photoshop when it came out in the 1990's. Its important to explain your Graphic design work in his classes.,1
During a pandemic she decided that she would have 5- 8 pre recorded lectures/week on top of live class on Thursdays. I have no time to watch all of the lectures on top of my five other classes. An extreme amount of lecture videos/material for a 3 credit course.,0
"Very nice prof, enjoyed his class but very detail-oriented! Also theres a lot of uncertainty in this course with a 30% lab final and 40% lecture final both scheduled in the final period so basically 70% of your mark is decided in the end.. But I enjoyed it and learned some interesting stuff. Also, its important to go to class.",1
"He is a really good professor. He teaches the basic skills needed based on the section and all those skills are easily used on the exams/quizzes. If you have any questions, ask. Overall he is a really good professor that made the class interesting. Ask questions or get help if needed. Pay attention, and do your homework to easily pass.",1
"fair teacher, but she's hard to understand with her accent, and her study guides are poorly done. In class her slides are barely done and she often talks about other things. The course in general didn't make much sense. we had a sub (dr. day) for two classes and learned more with him than I ever did with her",0
"She made computer hacking boring.  She has no idea how to teach, nor does she herself understand the course material.  She made this so awful I have decided to change direction and avoid the reset of the LAN classes",0
"Neglects to tell students about huge concepts until the review classes before the test.  Doesn't do anything but read from the slides. NO time in-class for students to do example problems and discuss, which is NECESSARY to understand math. Acts surprised and condescending when students aren't getting it.  DO NOT TAKE FINANCE WITH HIM.",0
"Hangue park is the worst prof there is to teach ECEN 215. He is new to teaching and was so nervous for the first lecture. He tried solving a question for 30 min and tried 3 ways to solve the question and couldnt figure out how to solve it. He's terrible at explaining things. Take Mina Rahimian or John Tyler for this. Park is nice, just is confused.",0
"I took this class online. The weekly learning modules were easy to access and assignments were easy to complete. I emailed her a few times about questions on an assignment and she would reply within a day or so. However, she is a tough grader and specific in what she's looking for in assignments. Sadly no extra credit. Overall easy going class.",1
"I took his class over 20 years ago.  It was a Pre-Calc class, so everything in it was what we should have learned before.  That didn't stop him from going over our heads, though.  He even berated the whole class after an exam by saying ""Maybe you are just stupid.""  I really thought it was me but reading all these reviews makes me feel vindicated.",0
"He is a nice guy and the class is a typical English class. However, he took forever to grade and I wish he gave harsher feedback. During conferences, he would dance around what he wanted to say and after he graded it, I realized what he really meant.",1
I had 30 people in my class. 4 people passed and we all got C's. I had a private tutor twice a week and sat at the communal math table all day. I worked as hard as possible but still barely passed. Do NOT take math with him! wait until you can have a different professor.,0
"Worst professor/class experience I have had at UCSC thus far. Unnecessarily mean and an absolute B. Horrendous experience, wouldn't recommend her to anyone. DO NOT TAKE HER CLASSES. Takes her frustrations out on her students and not one person I've talked to who has had her had anything good to say. Pretty much a 100%  ""hated it"" consensus.",0
"He always complained about our class's integration skills. He assured me since I aced the 3rd midterm I'd pass the final, but then put gotcha questions and exception to the rule questions on the final. Doesn't not help you work to keep any scholarships, etc. Aced MATH 106, 107, & 208 with ease, but his teaching style hinders any chance at an A.",0
Awful! If youre a visual learner this class will be extremely difficult. She uses launchpad & reef & theyre extremely expensive. If you dont buy them youll obviously wont pass! Her study guides are useless & she had no set office hours & its very hard to reach her. Do yourself a favor & dont take her,0
"He is strict with deadlines, grammar and structure. However, if you keep up with his pace it should be relatively easy to get an A. He does have a clear way of guiding the students on the papers, and he's very accessible in case you have questions.",1
"Professor Dillon is a wonderful person. She's really caring, and passionate about her subject. The only problem is she is the most unorganized person ever. All her directions are very abstract, thrown-together sentences that hardly make sense. Her syllabus is painful to read, and essay prompts are a headache. She also is not very open minded.",0
"He has the ability to be the best professor, but his attitude towards students and his rudeness already makes some of the hardest classes, harder. He is nasty in how he responds, refuses to help, and treats you like a moron, yet you don't get any other options.",0
"I would not recomend anyone to take her class. She always cancelled class. She graded all our work in like one day, right before grades were due. She's not difficult, her work is manageable but she isn't clear with instruction , I turned everything in and somehow I got a D? I surely don't understand her grading system.",0
"Lectures pretty much follow the book, but he makes it interesting. He also has on-line lectures if you miss class. Points are given for attendance and extra credit.",1
"Unorganized, always late, vague, and boring. I thought the class was going to be fun, but she somehow made it miserable & unbearable. She doesnt communicate her point clearly in class or on the tests. You may think ""well thats just one persons opinion of her"", but a lot of the class felt this way so avoid this lady at all costs...you will thank me!",0
she is an excellent professor. her class is almost entirely discussion based and she will clarify any and every question you have about something you read. she accepts everyones opinions and really wants to get to know her students. just read for class and participate and you will do well. she appreciates participation a lot! definitely take her!!,1
"By far the most dedicated prof in Asper. She loves accounting (yes I know..) and because of this she is very enthusiastic about teaching. Asper doesn't even deserve a prof of her caliber; she takes the time to change the curriculum to keep up to date with standards and expects students to explain answers, not just regurgitate. Best prof. Period.",1
"There tended to be confusion on the grading scale often. Rogers course was simply laid out, PowerPoint then group quiz. There was a research paper at the end of the course. She is a difficult women to get ahold of. On the plus side, she is incredibly good natured- she jokes and allows for discussion within the class.",1
From time to time his lectures can get a little dry but he'll tell you upfront. He is very aware of his students and their attitudes towards his class. If you're honest with him and genuinely want help he is awesome! He always had us laughing and the info stuck. Very recommendable if you're willing to put in a little time. ,1
"Im taking this class now and I hate that she takes so long to grade your essays , you cant apply the feedback to your next paper! She grades the papers pretty tough too. Hard to maintain an A due to that . And she she doesnt have extra credit for you to try to make up for a bad paper. Id never take her again !",0
"Hist 226 was my most interesting class this semester. Talbert is a great lecturer with substantial content. There are six, 1000 word papers, 2 quizzes, a midterm and final. Seems like alot of work, but isn't bad. I loved my TA (Tatum), not easy grader but definitely fair (I've heard one was bad). Attendance is taken every lecture. Would recommend.",1
Awesome!  Had her for 2 classes now & love the flipped classroom method.  Fair grader and always returns stuff the next class.  My favorite in the chem dept!,1
Good prof. Makes learning a second language very comfortable. Never makes anyone feel stupid about making a mistake. Good sense of humor. Excellent class.,1
She assigns a lot of work but its really easy. She's very silly in class and will tell you straight up that she's ADD. If you make an A you dont have to take the final.,1
"Not a bad teacher. Her tests are difficult, and much harder than she explains the problems to be. Homework is easy, basically try until you get it right. She will not take your crap at all and will try to make ACCT easy.. which is difficult for anyone to do. Dropped my GPA a bit even though I did great on hw just bad on tests. Fun teacher.",1
"I loved his class! From the beginning, he had the entire semester planned out start to finish. He was always sure to give great feedback, and was always nice to talk to as well. He provides many useful links on his website, such as various resources I otherwise wouldnt have known about on campus. Creative way to make English a fun class to attend!",1
"He sat on his computer the whole class and when you asked for help, and didnt understand the way he explained it, he just got annoyed. He told me that if I was too stupid to learn it in high school, he couldnt teach it to me now. It was a really upsetting experience.",0
Online Class. On assignments some material is not in the video or in the reading so difficult to answer. He gave out wrong conversions in an assignment and took points off for students using it stating we should of caught his mistake. His video's audio is terrible as well. Does not post grades until day before final! No Feedback! Quizzes are hard!,0
"Yvonne is the absolute worst professor in the Art Department. She doesn't trust that you are honest or dedicated, even if you show up and work hard in every class. Her assignment instructions are not instructions at all and her feedback is completely nonsensical. She will try to make your work fit her style instead of clearly outlining expectations",0
"Christopher Armstrong is one of the worst professors I have ever had. I have no respect for him and intentionally look for soc classes without him as the prof. A prof has never made me feel so dumb and incapable of myself and my abilities. I passed the class, but it was a terrible experience. I felt I could not come to him w questions. Avoid him.",0
"She is nice, but not a good teacher. Doesn't go through material very well and not organized. He class almost seems pointless. She expects more from you than what she teaches, and so very easy to get confused. Especially on tests and papers.",0
Professor Hersh makes things extremely unclear. It is impossible to know exactly what she wants from you unless you ask (the syllabus is impossible to comprehend) and even then the guidelines are hard to understand. Several essays and three assignments in which you must watch movies at home and answer study guide questions. Nothing is on canvas. The syllabus is more strict than she is. I've never done more unnecessary reading in my life.,0
"Soh at times is a nice person, but I would not recommend her as a professor for LITED 3115. The class itself is already so much work, but she takes forever to return your work and she'll ask you to completely change your lesson plans the day of teaching them. She doesn't answer your emails and when she does it's not a kind reply. Not worth it.",0
Extremely disorganized class. The content is difficult and she makes it more so. The TAs open lab hours are the only way I can try to understand the content or the assignments. Lectures are taken from previous quarters so dont make any sense. Very hostile whenever I tried to clarify things with her. Essays and quizzes every week.,0
"Professor Field is honest, caring, helpful, knowledgeable, passionate and incredibly smart. I respected him from the minute I walked into his classroom and still do! I looked forward to coming to his class each week and I feel so lucky to have met him. He is among one of the most quality professors at Rutgers.",1
Professor Nuneville really cares about her students and wants them to pass. All you really have to do is come to class. There are a lot of guest speakers but its better than just staring at your teacher talking the whole time.,1
"Amazing, sweet teacher! She uses real-life experiences to help us gain an understanding of what we are learning. She is very open to what the students have to say and loves discussing the material. There is only one group project but you discuss the material in groups in class. Take home quizzes. Open book final. Easy A! Just participate and enjoy!",1
There is 1 test (the midterm) and 1 project for the entire yearbut its a group project. The project turned out to be a 50+ page document between 4 people. He said that he was expecting around 100 pages. I did a majority of the project and made sure he knew that. I walked away with a B- and my group members who did nothing all got C+'s. DO NOT TAKE,0
"While Jen herself is nice, her quizzes don't line up with what is covered and are worth 25%. She gives 15 minutes for 10 question quizzes. She often says not to worry about things and then puts them on the quiz. She picks small phrases from the text instead of main concepts. Effort and putting in the work do not really correspond to grades.",0
This was an 8 week online course the teacher never e-mailed me back. After 8 weeks I was never given any feedback and nothing was graded. He has not posted my grade. He was not available by phone or in his office either. My classmates said they received no feedback or e-mails. To summarize I would not suggest taken an online course with Mr. Smith.,0
By far one of my favorite teachers at SMU! She is so sweet and truly cares so much about each and every one of her students. I've had her for 3 different classes. She is very understanding and she really appreciates it when students work hard!,1
"This guy doesn't cAre about the students, he doesn't have a heart and he will fail you if you don't pass his horrible class. Waste time, waste money he doesNt teach at all. He just read the slides. Don't take him if you wouldn't like to lose your money.",0
"Excellent professor. Best and most interesting first year professor by far. Lectures are debate intensive, interesting and extremely entertaining. Notes and paying attention in class are critical! Well worth it, for the jokes, and the knowledge!",1
He is not tough grading speeches. The only thing that will bring down your grade is TIME! Your final speech is worth the most so make sure you work on it before the week of.,1
A very frustrating professor. The mandatory-attendance lectures were the same as his videos online. The lectures did very little to help with homework and quizzes. Some assignments referenced topics which had never been covered and were never covered again. The quizzes had very little in common with the homework.,0
This class is interesting if you're an erudite because It's basically self-taught. Doesn't respond to emails or doesn't read them correctly. It's sad because it's a great topic but there was no passion for even showing people how awesome it is.,0
Notes are unclear as well as her lectures are pointless. Avoid.,0
"Professor Herz is great! He gives the impression of being very experienced despite being a fairly new professor, and he has a lot of knowledge to offer. He is a very friendly and helpful guy and a great person to have a conversation with. In class, he really values participation, and will help you as much as you need in order to get a good grade.",1
"I don't know what the other rating was saying, but homework is NOT optional. He emails me everything when I turned in an assignment saying how bad I did, and offers no suggestions. I don't even understand how it can be wrong when it's perspective questions. This isn't just me, it's everybody else in the class. He does not teach AT ALL.",0
I love kildea as a person and so so as a professor. he tends to get off topic and it screws you over come midterm and final time. his group project also made me want to shoot myself but i get why he assigned it,1
"Great professor, tough on the outside but wants all his students to be successful, he makes sure you have all the material needed to get a A on all exams. If you put in the effort you will do well.",1
"He's new. He's a fair teacher. He doesn't grade terribly hard. The work is not easy, but I would take a class with him again.",1
Took for Spring 2016 . Good teacher. Recommend. Gets kind of moody at times. Expect a lot of reading. One chapter a week with homework of a question or two. Easy Quizzes everyday when you come in usually about what you read. Group projects!! She's sweet and very mellow. A lot of presentations and one paper of 7-8 pages. Easy A class if you read,1
"Provides vague instructions. When asked to clarify, he said he couldn't waste time on my questions.  A few times he changed the focus/ parameters of an assignment, but the updated requirements were buried in his response to another student's DB post. His feedback is  a generic form; unhelpful, & mixed in a copy of the assignment instructions",0
"Sabolski is one of my favorite professors. He is a great lecturer, passionate about the material and overall great guy.",1
Vague explanation of how he grades the journal which is a major part of your grade. The class seemed more for students to fail than succeed.  Would not recommend taking this class unless you have to.,0
Took his online class and what he expects from you is extremely confusing and difficult. His tests are ridiculous (45 questions in 35 mins) and 3 essays in 75 mins (plus identifications) I suggest dropping his class immediately if you have the luck to get him.,0
This class was the hardest thing I have done in my life. This class made me very sad and depressed when I thought about it. Definitely prepared me for chem 2 but not sure it was worth the stress.,0
Exams are online and answers are in the power points which she posts on blackboard. Lab days are fun and lecture days are pretty boring. She's hot so didn't mind lecture days too much lol,1
"Professor Yemut is really cool, nice about the class. Can be hard to understand due to his accent but overall I understood everything and took a lot out of the class. Can be funny sometimes with the examples and is really easily approachable.",1
"This is the best and most clear teacher I have ever had! He was extremely helpful and would always stay after class to answer any and all questions. Come prepared and ready to learn because he likes to get the class involved and will ask questions. If you actually read the book and actively participate, you will get an A in the class for sure.",1
"Had her last semester for CS145 as my first coding experience. Thought her lectures structured well and gave the tools to do the homework, quizzes, and tests. Her grading criteria was super clear since she gave you exactly what the expected result was supposed to be. Always asked us questions in class for us to answer. Accessible by email easily.",1
"Dr. Holtzblatt was very funny and kept the class entertaining through the term. There are no pluses and minuses in the class so beware of this. The material is not that hard, but there is a lot of homework and most of your grade comes from the test 85%, which are semi easy. He is the best accounting teacher I have taken so far at CSU.",1
Actually said maybe statistics just isnt your thing after i went to his office hours to question the amount of points he took off for small math errors.,0
"Be very wary.  I would never encourage anyone to study privately with Terry.  Ther are much, much better trumpet teachers in Boston.  His information is limited.  He is not the kind of ""all-inclusive"" teacher that should hold a position at a major university.",0
Neely has an arrogant and condescending tone on the message board (it's an online class).His tone has an impatient edge much of the time. The description of the class states that you don't need knowledge of music but it's ridiculously advanced material and the tests illustrate that. It seems he teaches to elevate himself rather than his students.,0
"Professor Mantell is sweet, but there is too much information on the powerpoints. Grading for Lab is super easy. She does provide a study for each test. I highly recommend takin BIO before taking this class.",1
Great teacher.  I took her spring 2010.  She is the teacher that I compare all my professors too.  She sets you up for success.  Truly the greatest professor I have ever had.,1
I found this online class to be tough as well as the professor.   There is a lot of reading to do plus video lectures and a virtual child to raise.   There are also quizzes every week which are not easy even though they are open book.   I found the professor not to be very understanding either.,0
"Easy class. You learn more with AutoCAD the more you play with it. He'll give you some shortcuts on the keyboard that you might want to remember. There isn't much for him to teach, but he gets to the important things. Make sure to  work on the assignments outside of class if you want to turn them in on time.",1
"Best professor at UNT!  Challenging course and a lot of work, but she is always available and helpful.  When I interviewed for jobs, pretty much everything came back to her course.  I used my course project as an example of my work and people were impressed.",1
She was a good professor. Definitely want to pay attention and take notes. Missed two classes and bombed one of my exams. Simple math with moderate concepts.,1
"Very cool guy, and very knowledgeable!",1
"Don't ask questions unless you like looking stupid in public and being mocked.  His examples in class are all explained in the text making attendance pointless, but he grades on it.   The online homework bites, and his hints don't help.",0
"Definetely not a bad teacher. She is always available if you need help. There is a lot of reading material required for the class. For each book groups are chosen to spend an hour long class discussing it in great depth. Requires a decent amount of writing and essay assignments. All in all, she is a really nice teacher.",1
Terrible instructor. No teaching ability.  Complains constantly.  Does not know how to use basic technology. Rude and unhelpful.,0
He looks like Nicholas Cage....and i hate that guy...overall this teacher is not good if you want to learn about cinema..but if you want to learn about Greg's collection of horrible movies than take this class.,0
So easy to work with,1
"TAKE HER CLASS!!! Easy class, great professor, take notes it will help you a lot, only 4 papers to write, no exams/tests. Would take her class again, class was fun and not boring and she is really sweet and cares about students passing.",1
"You will learn more about colonization from reading Bartolome de las Casas' ""Brief Account of the Devastation of the Indies,"" than you will from this entire class. He spends about 90% of the time justifying the European colonizers and how it wasn't that bad. Only refers to native/aboriginal/indigenous people as ""Indians."" Calls slaves ""workers.""",0
"Kello is a nice guy, but he is clearly way more focused on his research than on his teaching. He barely prepares his lectures and his assignments are thrown together last minute and are extremely vague, almost unintelligible. The class was obviously an afterthought for him, and he is not experienced enough to wing it.",0
"I have mid 80's in all my engineering and math classes this semester, and mid 60 in his econ class. The exams make no sense, and the grading scheme is bizarre. His lectures are painful and repetitive, and he only covers simple topics. He uses slides provided by the textbook publisher. Worst professor I've had in 5 years.",0
"Very nice guy, but not very helpful. The other two portfolio professors Sean and Maria are much more productive with class time, and actually give helpful critique.",0
AWESOME TEACHER! Alex was a very fun and outgoing teacher but still taught the material. She provides you with everything you need to do well in her class. Just do the work she tells you to do and make sure to fill out and study the study guides! Highly recommend!!!,1
"Great guy and great class, helpful and funny!  One of the only classes I actually got something out of",1
"Very, very hard on grading.  Humiliating to some students.  Do not take writing with this instructor.  I recommend M. Hampton for all writing courses at MHCC!",0
This guy likes to talk a lot about his personal life and likes to retell boring anecdotes repeatedly every single lecture. Apart from being a strict guy he is extremely rude. If you are trying to get your GED done do not take him unless your really into poetry. Also be prepared to waste money on useless books. This man also takes attendance serious,0
"Without a doubt, the absolute worst instructor I have ever had. She speaks super fast (and won't slow down when asked), she is rude and arrogant. Your lucky if you get a 70% on her tests. She expects you to answer questions exactly how she describes them (even when she is incorrect). She is a really nice woman but a terrible teacher.",0
HORRIBLE! Do not take her class. Did everything she expected on papers and still get horrible grades. This class ruined my GPA. Tests are very difficult and when you meet with her for help she just basically tells you that she cant help you.,0
"Very lecture heavy. Group research project where you are designing & implementing your own study, graded very hard & did not take the assignment lightly for something that was made up & we are not actual researchers. Very strict with class time.",1
"Not only was he hard to understand and the homework/Accounting CD thing useless, according to his grading scale I should have gotten and A but he gave me a B. I tried emailing him/calling him MULTIPLE times (I'm a transfer), but he never responded. The material is easy but the professor is useless.",0
Amazing teacher.  Every class is interesting; a great lecturer and discussion starter.  You do need to pay close attention in class if you want to do well on the tests.  He's a tough but fair grader and lets you know how you can improve.  Very friendly.,1
Just do all the homework.,1
"I loved Mr. Pearson. He was blunt and to the point, and his comments, though often not flattering, were never a personal attack. He remains one of my favorite teachers from AMDA, and the benchmark for what i look for when i need someone to teach me something difficult. I think it was because he made his expectations very clear.",1
"He's so extra. If you can put up with him and his unnecessary attitude, it's pretty much an easy A.",0
You have to do the homework and show up on time this semester half my class dropped because it was too many papers like too many he should at least put it on the syllabus before because it would be better and gets mad that we couldnt take words from the class discussion for the mc notes he is a character mainly speak and you better be right,0
"Sister Howell is nice, but a bad teacher.  Everyone in the class is on their phones/bored to death because she just reads from the powerpoints.  For a 2 credit elective, this required way too much work.  Homework wasn't bad, but expect her to grade very specific/harsh on random things.  Tests were longer/more intense then necessary.  ",0
"He is extremely rude, and does not show any intent of having the students best interests. He does not answer questions in any helpful manor. He even snapped at students during the semester, raised his voice multiple times, and is generally an unwelcoming professor. He was the only one available so I had no choice unfortunately.",0
"No textbook! Let me just say, this guy doesn't have a negative bone in his body. (At least in a classroom environment) He is light-hearted, energetic, and truly cares. He presents problems in a way that actually has use in real life. I always dreaded conversions, however, we tackled the subject within the first week! Bro. Relieved my math anxiety!!",1
"Osoba likes to call on you in class even if your hand isnt up. Hes supper nice and a little to energetic for my liking. Gives optional problems sets, do them. Exams are difficult, no multiple choice and all open ended, lots of memorization",1
Most amazing professor I have ever had. His lectures are great. Teaches with passion. The 3 hour class flew by. I highly recommend him,1
Don't bother to take the online class.  You will receive little to no specific or constructive feedback on assignments.  You will do tons of useless busy work.  She will have you write rough drafts that she will not bother to grade or provide feedback on before the final draft of the paper is due. She is one of the worst teachers I have ever had.,0
You use wileyplus instead of blackboard. It costs extra and honestly is pretty confusing. He barely remembered to post anything on time. Honestly for as little as he did to teach us I think he should have gave us all As. Dont plan to learn anything in his class. Not good for students who do not want to teach themselves the material.,0
I don't even know where to begin. She thinks she's a Messiah of math and don't even know ho to teach and gives too much homework to and its about 250 math problems per week. Please don't take her any math classes NO EVEN JOKING.,0
"Vincent is the best instructor that I have had at Baker. He gives great feedback plus additional information and links to help understand the material. He loves to teach and it shows. I highly recommend taking a course with him, you will not be disappointed.",1
"4 people in our class of 32 passed Professor Konya's Calculus 1 class. I understand that this is not an easy subject, but when 8% of the class receives passing grades it is no longer about how the students are failing to understand the concepts, but rather about how the teacher is failing to teach.",0
"I agree with the previous review -- Miller is NOT hard, you just have to do the work.  He's willing to help you whenever you need it and he cares about his students.  He does NOT, however, spoon feed it to you.  You have to be willing to do some critical thinking.  He really cares that his students learn to THINK.",1
"Very time restricted exams online, has habit of not unlocking assignments on time",0
"Right now she is it for A&P lectures so you have no choice. Her teaching style is very hard to follow, doesn't make it easier to understand.  Her testquizes are hard.  Feel like she is trying to trick you. If you have to take her use other supplementary material to help you pass this class. You will have to spend ALOT of time studying.",0
"This professor did not make Canvas announcements or update the syllabus when important date changes were made (including test dates and assignment due dates!!!). He also decided to cancel class without making an announcement. Talking to him is difficult, asking questions doesn't work, his exam review doesn't truly prepare you. Teach yourself.",0
"Very nice guy and easy to understand but he himself I feel is lacking in knowledge on the material. As a child psychologist I don't think he is a good fit to teach Stats. A lot of homework was assigned for very little credit and you have to teach yourself a lot of the material. Sweet man, but not the best choice for the subject.",1
Dr.Houston grades unfairly and she is not helpful,0
I took his abnormal psychology class and loved it! He is very talkative and really teaches with zest. We sat in the front row so we could hear better and ask questions.,1
"Super nice and caring, very approachable. Quite a bit of group work, often overlaps which can get overwhelming. He's a vague with his project instructions. 1 midterm, no final, 1 group presentation, 1 group paper, 1 group bargaining exercise, 15 discussion board posts/accompanying reflection paper. Do the reading/watch the videos and you're good.",1
"I took her for stats and while I do not think she was good at teaching it, she truly cares about the students. She should be teaching clinical, she is a coauthor! She is sweet and goes out of her way to help students. She even apologized when the material got difficult and she couldn't explain it better. I love this woman.",1
"I absolutely love Professor Mason. His knowledge of British Literature is incredible and he teaches it in a way that is interesting and retainable. He's funny, witty, and will help you learn!",1
"Dr. King is a great professor! Though at first his module seemed a bit disorganized, he eventually pulled everything together.  He is extremely helpful in office hours and will talk to you about just about anything. Also, he has a great personality that makes him fun to listen to and he almost always has a tie that relates to the class!",1
"she is very bad, class is very boring. Too many works have to do, at least 2 journal every week.class writing everyday. DON'T TAKE HER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",0
Great class! He expects alot from students and grades very hard. But that made me just want to work harder. Great classroom discussions. Loved the book.,1
"The most insulting aspect of this class was the fact she using cross-word puzzles.  My God, I thought I was back in elementary school again.   This is not a college-level instuctor and I will never take another class with her.  The Department of history has the best professor on campus and the worst.  Very sad.",0
"good prof. watch his lectures read the textbook and youll pass, quizes are shortly times so you will have to work fast!! the rest was pretty solid .",1
Very corny professor but fairly easy course.  Pay attention and take notes and you should have no problem getting a good grade.,1
Great professor. Very intelligent and easy to understand. The best advice is to READ THE BOOK!! All of her tests come straight out of the book and not from lecture. Tests are very difficult but the class is fun overall.,1
"He offers feedback on journal entries and short writing assignments. I dont know why I took this class, I hate writing essays. Also dont take him if youre in a different country but if youre east coast youre chilling. Idk why he made it mandatory to attend class but I just had my camera off and slept. Glad its finally over good freaking bye",1
"Dr. Druffel is the nicest professor at UCI.  She genuinely wants her students to do well & provides multiple opportunities to gain points. The course material is a little dry, but that's not her fault! She tries to make it as interesting as possible, and as long as you come to class and do the homework, you will do well in her class.",1
Rad dude!,1
She is GREAT GREAT GREAT!!!!!!!!!,1
She is an easy grader. Amazing lectures.,1
"Participate, seek assistance when needed and your time in this class will be worth it; dont participate and you will rate Matt and the class awful. But who's fault is that? Everyone I spoke to learned something more than they knew about public speaking. That was my goal, I'm pleased with the results, thank you Professor Rosenberg",1
"Dr. Evans is definitely a toughie, but the classes he teaches are very interesting and he knows so much about his subject. His tests can be brutal if you don't give yourself enough time to study for them, and his feedback on the tests is usually illegible because of his handwriting. But besides that, he has taught me so much & I've enjoyed classes.",1
"I'm going to be very honest, he is not a very good teacher. He bases your essay from best to worst in the class. The whole class he spends talking about god knows what and worst he does not keep up with the schedule or assignments. I ended the class with a B but still wasn't satisfied with his teaching or how he graded the assignments.",0
Have not had much experience with this prof yet but she DOES NOT REPLY TO EMAILS AT ALL. I have emailed 3 times in the past week after missing the first class with no response to my questions. Office hours are only by appointment so there is no easy way to get in contact with her AT ALL.,0
"I had Mrs. McCormick for pharm and she was very unclear. She's a sweet person with a sense of humor, but this is not her subject. You definitely have to study the powerpoints and use the book for reference - she does take questions from the book that she didn't stress in class. Even if pharm isn't your subject, if you study well you can get a B.",0
She thoroughly went over everything that she knew you would encounter in your homework. Always gave numerous examples to clarify the subject. Anytime you had a question she was more then happy to answer it and even explain it in a way that you would understand it. She really is passionate about what she teaches! I highly recommend her class!,1
This professor is so hard if you do not know spanish and to top it off he is a prefectionist. If you miss an accent or mispell somethings its wrong. He is boring and his class is to hard.,0
Very understanding!! Actually tries to help his students,1
"If speaking isn't your thing, he's the perfect professor. He is really easy on grading and format for speeches. Impromptu speeches make it so you need to show up to class and he subtract a lot of points for not being there for others speeches. The people who didn't get As are the people who missed multiple speeches. If you try you'll get an A",1
"She is very reasonable, she grades her papers easy I received an A on every single paper I wrote in her class. We did done online homework not sure she checks it we also use the books for notes and hw which are pretty simple but her test are very challenging I always received 60 or 70's on the test but I passed the class with a B. I recommend her",1
Dr. Schmitz is incredibly helpful and knows what she is teaching. I highly recommend taking a class with her! I would definitely hope to get her as a professor again,1
"Ne prenez jamais Lawrence Olivier. Incompréhensible, CONFUS, il est perdu comme ca ce peux pas. Les textes qui nous donne sont incomplet, parfois en vieux français, il ne donne pas d'explication, fait juste lire les textes en classe... Bonne chance pour vos travaux, vous ne savez pas comment faire? Lui non plus.",0
"She knows her info, but it's a confusing topic to begin with so you just get more confused. Typewrite everything she says! Ppts are kinda disorganized. Txtbk is not mandatory but good reference. She's the only one who teaches this class (only winter qtrs). Quizzes, midterms, final are multiple choice and short answer (need to be specific)! ",0
"HARD CLASS!!! His lectures are really interesting but totally different from his test. The book didn't help either. GO TO EVERY CLASS, even though it is not mandatory. He is a great teacher and helpful, but with the difficulty of his test, I would just avoid the class all together. I'm an A student, but this class totally destroyed my GPA :(",1
"Sue, SUCKS!!!!! DO NOT TAKE HER! If you want to learn anything take a different teacher. You'll sit in class and waist time, you don't learn anything from her and she is the lead instructor for the class. The other teachers (co-instructors) were good but they don't teach as much. She is very vague on what she says you should know.  BAD TEACHER >_<",0
"Went into the class thinking it would be really enjoyable, but I was wrong. He grades extremely harshly and is extremely abrasive. Not a nice dude and don't even try fighting for your points back because that wont happen.",0
Average exam scores are always below 60%. Heavy homework. Doesn't explain things very much. This course requires intelligence of your own. I wouldn't take this course if it weren't for the graduation requirement.,0
Had Him for Modern Social Problems (2111). Enjoyed the class and was SUPER easy if you read the book and took notes. One of the classes where you'd need to enjoy the subject to take it and be interested; I imagine that most who gave bad ratings to him were people  who didn't enjoy Sociology and just took it for requirements,1
"Hollis is really hilarious. He keeps his lectures interesting, and he knows what he's talking about. His sense of humor is on point. He is very helpful and he's one of those professors who is adorably excited by his subject. His class isn't easy, but he's awesome!  ",1
"I had Tucker of 101, 102, and Brit Lit. She's an average teacher. Kinda mean but just go to class and pay attention. Her tests are kinda hard. She's very liberal. Kinda boring sometimes.",1
"So it's my first semester at UAA. I take Ross's class online. The prof seems nice-but he doesn't interact with you at all. Outside of BlackBoard, he doesn't talk. If you take his class online, be prepared to read the textbook and take notes. DO THE ONLINE QUIZZES. DO THEM. They WILL save your butt on the tests (which compose your entire grade btw).",0
worst professor ever,1
"Such an easy class!!! Wow, if you take this professor, you definitely won't regret it. No homework, you can find the answers online for the 3 quizzes he gives, and that's pretty much it! No midterm or final, only 1 group assignment which is easy too. You can sign the attendance and just leave later class. Definitely a good pick not gonna lie.",1
"She never explains her project expectations, frequently uses profanity in class, and is heavy on favouritism. She grades difficult to make her classes seem more intense than they actually are. Surprised if she runs her 2 hour lecture for longer than 45 minutes. An easy way to get a good grade is to just go along with her jokes.",0
"the worst class I've taken in college. Professor Lee was not only harsh but extremely critical and mean, and would publicly shame students in the classroom. The directions were VERY unclear, assignments were never given correct due dates and there was no feedback ever except for harsh criticism. This class interfered with my health & psyche",0
Very boring classes that while not required are pretty much required from in class assignments.  The semester starts as a lot of review as well.  I found her grading to be very poor as well.  For the project she would not account for early errors when grading the rest.  She also wasn't clear on formatting and took off points for that.,0
"DO. THE. HOMEWORK. The homework is ""optional"", but if you do not do and master the homework, you will not do well in this class. Those optional questions for 1.3? On test 1, study them the MOST. Do not feel bad about taking this class twice.",1
Hard grader no mercy of second chances to pass,0
"Worst teacher/professor I've ever had. She's a scatterbrain who loses work, gives inaccurate grades, plays favorites, and is always in a bad mood. She gives free grades out to students who help her with yearbook during class and gives grades based on if she likes you or not. I literally learned not one thing from taking her English Comp class.",0
Just dont do it to yourself.,0
She never responded to any emails. If you skip more than 2 or 3 classes your grade will suffer immensely. Not very understanding about technological issues or absences. She doesn't accept Dr's notes either. Pointless class with only busy work.,0
He is literally my favorite professor here! He is very understanding and lenient and willing to work with you! He is very passionate and facilitated amazing discussions that make you think deeply and critically about things you may have never even thought about! Definitely take a class with him at UR!,1
"Prof Yang cares about her students and wants them to do good. I appreciate that she gives a lot of opportunities to raise your grade, but ultimately you receive a greater workload. It was reassuring that even if I flunked an assignment, my grade would not entirely suffer. An A grade is definitely achievable (I was 0.3 away).",1
"Wonderful instructor. Very friendly, and her assignments are simple (they require that you think, of course, but they are in no way difficult) and direct. Her lecture style (which we have only a little of being that this is largely a discussion class) is clear and well articulated. My favourite LSU instructor so far.",1
"Good class to take for gov credit. Three papers and three tests make up a very large percent of your grade. LOTS of reading, do not fall behind or else you'll be cramming it all the night before the test. Lecture is required, most of the test material comes from it. Lectures are interesting if not a bit slow. Study guides are provided before tests.",1
"Weekly forum posts, 4 responses; weekly 2-3 page writing assignment; final writing assignment 5-7 pages; reading is the norm; not much actual teaching/original work; APA citation, stickler on that. no quizzes, no final exam; nice professor; drudgery class",1
"Let me just say, That Gregg is probably the worst Cinema teacher I have taken. The other cinema professors are better then this clown. Last time I check having an opinion on a film that you don't agree with. Shouldn't lower your grade. Infact, I have not met any professor who takes points a way for not having the same ideas like others for filming.",0
I am so shocked at all the negative reviews but I respect everyone's opinion and their experience is not similar to mine. Professor Karen is a gem and she's always available for her students. The class was fun and I enjoyed it too! If you don't like to participate in discussion boards and follow APA guidelines you will get in trouble.,1
Brown a really nice guy and he does a lot better at teaching Orgo 2 then 1. If you read the book before class you'll really understand his lectures. A 60 is a C in his class and he curves more then professor i've ever known (i've had 18pt curves before). He's an okay teacher and you can definitely do well if you try really hard.,1
He is a teacher that acts like you already know how to complete this math. I spent most of the class lost. During lectures he talks so damn fast and again acts like we know everything that he's doing.,0
"I like the way he teaches but he is pretty hard and semi-strict, however I learned a lot and I would take him again",1
I learned a lot in this class. He takes extra steps to clarify assignments for the class. He always had a very good answer for every question asked during the class.  Great feedback on papers. Excellent class. Excellent prof.,1
Professor Sheehan is simply a very dull teacher. This was probably the most boring class I have ever taken during my college career and I would not recommend it if your looking for a good interactive geologic experience. I really enjoy geology yet this class was brutal to sit through the lectures(Online format). Very easy A though.,0
"Blanton is the harshest grader ever. Since he used to proof read for an insurance company for decades, he takes off point for any little thing on an essay or summary. For example, he takes off five points for leaving too much space between your name, the date and class subject on an essay. THOSE DAYS ARE OVER, BLANTON. STOP BEING SO RIDICULOUS!",0
"Good teacher but gives a ridiculous amount of homework. Try 5-10 assignments a week; oh & there are 5 papers. Additionally, many of the assignments seem like busy work that she doesn't even grade based on effort/quality. If you do poorly on an essay or miss an assignment, it wont matter bc there are so many assignments to balance out low scores.",0
"Rob is extremely lenient, understanding, and easygoing and unlike a typical professor he treats you with realistic expectations and knows that ""life happens"" sometimes and is realistic and not unforgiving. Only downfall is talking in front of the class and multiple group projects! No textbook either - he provides it! I took multiple classes w/him.",1
I can not stand this lady. Michelle is very rude she wanted an assignment completed but does not explain exactly what she wants. It was painful being in her class. I felt like all I did was cram everything I read and did not learn anything. She gives so much work and the readings were unnecessary. It took her days to respond to my emails. Skip her!,0
"Prof. Weber is the definition of laziness. No lesson plan, he teaches out of the book. He makes up problems that backfire in the middle of lecture. (frustrating) He assigns most of odd problems, but class notes are not enough to encounter the difficult problems. You must teach your self and speed lots of hours in the math success center.",0
Awesome teacher!! Took her for all comps & world lit!! ,1
Hands down would never take again. Literally the worst math teacher I have had. I spent more time researching how to actually solve math problems than I did learning what was actually taught. There's also videos in the course that may be either on point or completely not what the homework is about. No Communication at all,0
"The BEST class I've seen translate to online learning this semester! Rotating schedule for discussion posts/reply, sync/async Google Doc classes and Zoom chats for discussion too. The variety helps keeps it spiced up and interact with material in different ways. Genuinely compassionate, gets the Zoom University struggle, and loves what she teaches!",1
"Professor Martin is a very nice lady. Besides that, there is not many other positive ways to describe her as a teacher. She is VERY disorganized and unclear in everything she talks about. We have three classes left and she wants us to do some informative essay, group project, and reflective analytical essay over assignments we have yet to get back.",0
"Good teacher, can be quite harsh on marking participation.  You really need to say something each class.  Extremely harsh on absence: 2 unexcused • 2 grade drop! Take notes from the powerpoints because she doesnt post online and wont let you see them again.",1
"Dr. Brown is a charismatic guy but  not an easy professor. Needed to memorize a lot of info that wasn't all on the slides so you really had to pay attention (speaks at low volume). Not many tests so there's a lot on each one - expects very specific dates, locations, multiple examples (all short answer). Too in depth for an intro level class.",1
"You will work for your grade in his class, but you will be appreciative for it afterwards. I've had him for two classes, both of which were tough, but I came out truly knowing the material. Gives solid feedback on the homework - which there is a lot of, but I actually liked it! TAKE HIM!",1
"Dr. Childs was great!  She knows her stuff.  I would read the text and be confused and then go to class and she would make everything clear.  While I didn't like the Aplia homework, her tests were way better!",1
perfect,1
"I was recommended by other people to take this class, and that was the worst mistake ever, this professor doesn't introduce topics he goes over a topic once and thats it, maybe touching back on it before the test but again only once. He isn't clear, the hw isn't helpful, he never goes over hw so you don't know if you did it right, bad class.",0
"The professor is kind, and that is it. She teaches an interesting subject, but she is a very boring teacher. She didnt live up to her make up policy. Also, I already study psychology on my own time and soon realized she was halfway teaching information. Do not take this professor if you want to truly learn psychology.",0
"Shef is a bit unorganized and scatter brained, but he is a decent professor.  He requires A TON of work but its craft, can't except anything less from Craft.  He's there for his students and very helpful if YOU ask for it.  Super tough grader on his papers so be prepared.",0
"she is one of the worst teachers I ever had. She makes lots of mistakes during lecture, and most of her mistakes fixed by students, she is a tough grader, she will take off 6-8 points because you made a small mistake but its fine for her to make mistakes. she just copy her notes, she don't explain anything, you gotta figure it out by yourself.",0
1 word- BORING! It was honestly the worst class i've had so far.,0
"This class was honestly a pretty easy A, especially once I realized the tests were mostly made up of the online quizzes that were homework assignments. He posts his lectures online and provides study guides. McDevit is a cool guy and actually made me enjoy and understand biology for once in my life.",1
"She is my favorite professor at Meredith, hands down!  She is funny, engaging, and smart as a whip-- she knows her stuff! I've taken her for Counseling, Abnormal, and Personality and I wish I could take her more!  She is wonderful to talk to and her class is very straightforward.  One thing I will say is that she reuses stuff, but it's very good.",1
Stay away! She is useless!,0
"you basically need to study on your own, lectures are super boring and no quizzes to boost up marks. He is also very picky and a tough grader when it comes to wording for the written part of his exams. If this is your first time taking the course, you should probably get someone else to really explain the information since bio is generally hard",0
"Very disappointed. Ridiculous amount of work for the level of content covered. Labs worth 1% of total bio grade but could be 8-10 hours of work each week when done right. The 4 tests were cruelly short (45min) with short response that required more than could be done in the timeframe, 60% averages. Even if you are a good student, avoid this lab.",0
"Many dislike Serocki, but I actually enjoyed his humor and overall character. However, his lectures are power point based. He doesn't read slides word for word, but he just skims them stream of consciousness style because he knows everything. Numerical examples are few and far between. HW optional. Not the worst tax class you can take I think.",0
"I don't recommend taking her online course. There was quite a bit of reading, but that is to be expected. Ridiculous time limits on exams/quizzes, NO feedback, and turn around time for grades (semester is over and I still haven't received grades for 2 papers- be prepared to wait 8-10 weeks). DON'T. DO. IT.",0
"HORRIBLE! I could not wait to take Spanish but after her class, there is NO WAY that I am taking Spanish 2. This woman cannot teach. Talks a lot yet says nothing. If you aren't willing to eat,breathe and sleep spanish 24 hrs a day,then don't take Fletcher's class. This is THE ONLY CLASS you will have time for.Don't do it.Take Sign Language instead.",0
"I got an A in this course, but I don't feel like I learned anything.  The professor seemed nice on the surface.  However, he was a huge scatterbrain and his lectures often went on long rants about minor details.  Take this class if you have to, otherwise please don't.  Most of my classmates did awful in this course, he has a specific grading style.",0
"DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS! Very confusing and all over the place kind of teaching. His teaching is to give you 2 different textbooks and watch you tube video lectures-which he states not to pay too much attention to! Tests-essays on 450 pages of info but no specifics The ""reviews"" for the quiz/test are paragraphs and can't relate to the texts.",0
"Honestly Professor Schap is actually really enjoyable and can be funny in lecture. However, his material is very challenging and he grades tough. Every class will go 5 minutes over so be prepared for that if you have a class after. Additionally reading the text and doing the problem sets are a must to do well in the course.",0
"Should not be a professor. He does not ramble on for 2 12 hours, he RANTS. Is not a fair grader at all when it comes to the case study that barely are a part of your grade. Have to do a ridiculous case study on Nucor that you need to site your sources for. Easy midterm. the BSG game isn't simple but doable. Would not recommend, take someone else.",0
"Were halfway into the semester and the only thing I have in the grade book is attendance. She always cancels class, sometimes at the last minute too.",0
"The class has about 12 labs, run by a different TA for each week. The lectures before the labs were very dry. Make sure you read the lab manuals to complete lab reports. The final exam was extremely difficult and no one expected it. Know everything about everything if you want to do well on the final and get an A in the class.",0
"Homeworks is optional, but do it! Trust me! I didnt do my homework the first half of the semester and only passed this class by the Grace of God! VERY test heavy. Does not give extra credit. Usually only explains things one way even if you ask because you do not understand. She tries hard to be helpful and great; but in my opinion, she isnt.",0
"Great teacher! Very kind wantS her StudentS to paSS ! Read chapter, write two page paper due at the end of the week. USe turnitin, informal writing baSed on material and opinion.",1
Mr ward has been my favorite professor throughout all my years here he makes history fun and engaging. The class is easy if you show up and pay attention. Ask him for help with anything and he is more than happy to meet outside of class with you. Wish he taught all my classes.,1
"Bartee is awesome. She knows her material and is very organized. She never misses class, and answers every question you could have. She is easy going, tho she wants you to learn your material. I would take her again, and recommend you do the same.",1
"Lectures are boring, tests are extremely hard. She gives homework a lot and gives extra credit with the homework, but tests are only out of 25 points with 2 bonus questions. She posts the notes on D2L and cancels class a lot.",0
"Craig is cool and has done a lot in his own career, but thats all his lectures are about- correlating everything back to him. He doesn't respond to emails, cancels class from time to time, and never grades anything. He isn't the most helpful to students in class or those he is the advisor for",0
"Good, fun teacher. Lots of homework and online confusion. Probably one of the better choices for this class. I would give her a B+; well worth the hassle.",1
"Hard marker, unclear.",0
She never posts her slides online until after the mid term so you need to be in class to take notes. There a periodical assignments she gives you but I haven't gotten any of them back yet I am unsure if I'm doing them right. I've tried emailing her for guidance countless times but she doesn't answer emails. Frustrating prof. Try another for SOC111,0
She is a great professor and the class was very straight forward with just 5 essays pretty much being the entirety of what the class is. The only issue I had was that it felt pointless to go to class and this class seems to be meant for online.,1
I have taken Collier for both PSC 141 and 142. He works well with athletes who have busy schedules.,1
Excellent teacher who knows her stuff well.highly recommend to anyone,1
"I've had Dr. Searfoss twice, and I like her. She cares about her students and brings food to exams. This class is not easy; you will have to read and study. Exams are 80 % of your grade. I did very well, but I read, studied, and did homework. Wasn't bad for me. Overall, this class is alright, and I like Dr. Searfoss.",1
This prof is unorganized! His slides aren't labelled properly and he is horrible at explaining material in a clear and concise manner. I would not recommend this course.,0
" For this semester D'Sa has changed the syllabus to make the class even harder than last semester. The class now has quizzes instead of participation. If you miss just 1 question on a quiz or exam you will lose 1 percent of your grade. You will learn a lot in class, but it isn't easy. Take Spizman if you want the easier professor for Finance 3410.",1
"Easy, but boring -- she just reads off power point slides. As long as you know everything on the study guide she gives you (just look in the book), you'll get an A.",1
"Alex is probably my favorite professor here at Pitt. If you see that her rating is a 4.9 and assume it is an easy class, you're so wrong. It was probably one of the hardest classes I have taken so far (I took up to Calculus in high school). Be prepared to do a lot of work. She is super nice and absolutely loves cats and is a great teacher",1
Northrup is wicked understanding and helpful. He is extremely accessible and even gave out his cell number to the entire class. If you ask for help he will spend a lot of time helping you. He can be disorganized at times but its nothing crazy,1
This is a tough class! He will be very straight forward with you from day one. Only take class if you are serious about wanting to be in the medical field. Test are advanced. Make sure you have time to study EVERYDAY! Oh... And make sure you participate!,1
"Some days he is hands off and lets the student ""leaders"" lead the newspaper but other days (most days) we are mindless drones just making the stories and pages the way he tells us.  He makes you dumb down your writing then talks to you like your dumb.  I want to write for the NY Times, not the press telegram, thank you!  Made me hate journalism",0
"This teacher physically couldn't be any more boring. She doesn't understand the basic concept of a gen-ed. The tests will feature random factoids, that don't show up in the textbook nor the lecture slides. You are punished for studying the review sheet that she issues. This is stealing.",0
"I took his class in Spring semester . Just want to share my opinion for who want to take this class. If English is your second language and you are not VERY GOOD at Enlgish, want to get A with ENG1302, DON'T TAKE HIS CLASS. I had D grade with his class EVEN I finished all the essays in class and I have to take this class again.",0
"Dr. Brower is ok in class, lectures are somewhat solid. HOWEVER, and a BIG HOWEVER is his grading system and his tests. They are both incompetent. He writes a disclaimer in the syllabus in which he decides to change anything when he wants to. DO NOT TAKE HIM, GPA KILLER. HE SAYS HE TRIES TO HELP STUDENTS, BUT HE ONLY HURTS THEM...",0
"He's a nice guy, but his teaching style is super weird. No textbook, which means lots of reading of links off of BlackBoard. Complete every single question on the Problem Sets or no credit - just write anything in; he just checks to see you did it! All exams are open-ended. This is a course you really need to teach yourself.",1
"I took Math 90 online...Mr. Narin was a great professor to take an online class from.  His website was very clear...he (and his T.A., Linda) responded very quickly to any questions. You know exactly what is on every test and quiz because he provides a review before each with answers.  Definitely recommend!",1
"Had Dr. Palacios before she became a permanent part of the department. She reads off her notes which shows she does not know her material, her test was so hard everyone failed so she added a bonus essay. She seems sweet but she is boring in class and her textbook is sooooooo dry. AVOID.",0
"This class is awful. An insane amount of work and the homework consists of questions with up to five different parts where if you get just one part wrong, it gives you a 0% on the entire question. The professor does not help in any way as I have reached out through email multiple times with not even one reply. Please don't take this professor!",0
He is an nice man but not a very talented in the teaching department.I learned very quickly just to read out of the book and to show up for Friday quizzes.that's right he does a quiz every Friday and they don't help on the test. All in all you are stuck taking him for organic because oc only offers him.,0
"I would definitely recommend taking this class if you're passionate about music. Professor Guzzone is awesome and involved in the music industry so he's extremely knowledgeable. The lectures are 3 hours long, but they don't feel that long when you're listening to the Beatles and watching videos of Bob Dylan in between lecture slides. ",1
Dr.Kosnik's class is so fun! He obviously loves music and everything about his class. The tests are easy if you study. You will often use the textbook. I wish Dr.Kosnik taught Business classes because I really miss him now.,1
"Your entire grade is based on midterm and final tests (aside from research credit), and tests are almost all based on textbook readings. You can get by in the course by never going to class and reading the textbook. When I did go to class, he was very knowledgable and well-versed on the content. Lectures did not help me do better on midterms.",1
"He will give you blatantly wrong answers that tutors will correct (once he's walked away), and refused to explain in depth (""I just have years of experience""). His class was scheduled to start on a Thursday (according to Pima's My Courses tab), and he still counted everyone as absent for Tuesday (the intended? date). I will never take him again.",0
"This class is horribly boring, it is impossible to follow the lecture becuse she is jumping all over the place and very unclear. Attendence is graded so you have to come to class. Tests are easy though, but this was literally the worst class I have ever taken at UMass.",0
"Nagase-sensei is a ball of sunshine. She is always patient with students and always willing to help if you ask. She cracks the best jokes, too. I am always learning something in that class.",1
Readings were easy. Average on the open book midterm was a D which was curved to Bs and As. Monotone lectures which consist of reading off blocks of texts on a word doc. What the prof is looking for on exams is unclear. Says he wants little to no quoting but you get graded down if you don't use the specific vocab from the reading.,0
"Rude and unapproachable.  Very Unprofessional, she  talks down to students in front of patients.",0
"Every time he just went through his staffs quickly without good explanation. Feels like he was so rushed. Only talked problems without explain why need to to this, he just pulled out one general entry and said you need to do this and this.",0
"This was an online class. She stated she would respond to e-mails within 24 hrs. She never responded to one all semester, never responded to any message board posts either. Took a long time to grade project as well.",0
"The lecture will be Tripp going over math problems on the board. Pretty chill guy and explains the math well. I do agree that he'll lecture on how to do problems and then the exams will have things that are one step beyond what was taught, but most of the time you can figure it out. Webassign is dreadful, shame he uses it for the online homework.",1
"Rick is a super-caring guy, very invested in education and health promotion. I've taken him 3 times and I have found that he is most knowledgeable in strength and conditioning, but could have done better with KIN Anatomy (still great though). Fairly easy, but he still makes you prove that you know your stuff.",1
DO NOT take class from this professor. He was the worst instructor I have ever had. I had to teach myself all of the class content from the text.,0
"I learned so much from Professor Currys class. Readings can be dense, and there is a quiz almost every class. Discussions are engaging, and help to clarify the readings. Be sure to brush up on your grammar before taking her classmost points lost will be from poor grammar on essays. I dont think she gives A+s. I had 97.9% and got an A.",1
Literally the best.,1
"She's honestly not a great professor. I took her for almost every class she taught at Siena and I had to teach myself most of the time. She talks down to you if you don;t understand stuff right away, but she's a really nice lady. Super gossipy. Be careful what you say in front of her. The whole chemistry department will know.",0
Emailed them to put me from the waiting list to the class roster for financial aid reasons. They replied saying they could register me on day 1 and email my advisor. First day rolls around & I email them 1 hr prior to class for the zoom link since I noticed Im still not registered. No response. I email them again the next day & still nothing.,0
"She uses the socratic method to get students who are struggling with concepts to realize the answer as said in another comment. She doesn't mean to single students out, it could feel that way. Personally I would take her class again because she will go out of her way to help you and answer questions. Also do not be afraid to ask questions in class.",1
Today was my first class with him and he very passionate on what he is teaching to students. He is a Sergeant after all! Already I can tell he truly cares about his students and will be there for you if you have any questions or concerns. Excited to be taking this class I know it'll be great! And no the textbook isn't required!!!!,0
Professor Jarcho is fine. The TA is the worst nightmare of the class. Gives your paper the lowest grade you would ever get in any classes and doesn't explain why. TA does all the grading so be prepare to fail.,0
Such a good professor! As long as you participated in class and put in effort on the assignments you got an A. He was super awesome as a person too and really cares about his students. Moved deadlines if students were really overwhelmed with with other classes. Super approachable!,1
I took Hadavas for Survey of Calculus and he is by far the worst professor I have had. He is completely useless and honestly just has bad teaching skills. Make sure you are decently good at math because most of the course you have to look up youtube videos because his lectures are powerpoints and the HW program is terrible and does not help you.,0
Dr. Schwartz is not an easy teacher but he cares about his students. He wants to make sure you know the material so he is a tough grader but fair. I can say that I am well prepared for the classes to follow.,1
Prof. Gaffin always covers EVERY part of the reading in the textbook to ensure that everyone knows whats going on. He is inspirational and makes an hour and 15 minute lecture weirdly entertaining. He is the best and I would not want any other prof. for that class.,1
"Vet Tech majors, beware. Dr. Woodard, while intelligent, has not a clue on how to teach. Consistently changes his mind about the material. Write down everything. He often veers off topic and rants about how students are not doing the work rather than teaching so that we can complete it. Will make you want to change majors. Just stick it out.",0
One of the worst teachers I've ever taken. Too many assignments for an online class. Too many small things you had to complete in order to get your real work done. Too many things due at once. Too many things due back to back. She was really rude when you did reach out to her. She just didn't care.,0
"Professor Paquette's online class has clear grading criteria and doable assignments on interesting topics. To get an A, you should post two paragraph discussion posts and reply to 2 people once a week and read the assigned articles. Also, make use of saddleback's online paper center, they give good feedback on essays.",1
"My previous comments have been deleted, but I dislike Denise so much I come back here and post again about how terrible that class was. Enough said.",0
"Love this man! So much passion for his work and you can tell he loves what he is teaching. I didn't think I'd enjoy this class as I had to take it because of my learning community, but it was GREAT and an easy A. I studied a lot and went to every class, but that is what college is for. Within a few weeks, my entire learning community loved this guy",1
"Excellent professor. Wants her to students to understand the course topics. However, Cotes grading strategy is hard to come to terms with. Double check your work! Also, a friendly tip will be: dont email her about a question you received no credit for on your exam or quiz, she will review your whole exam and maybe deduct more points.",0
"Scott is a great guy, his tests are very similar to the power point presentations.  Presentations only display single words; make sure you go to class to get the definitions/examples.  I wish more classes were taught his way.  Only take marketing with Scott.",1
"I'm very gad that I took Dr. Nguyen last semester. He is very smart, helpful and funny. As long as you do your hw and all the lab stuff sufficiently, for sure you will get full credit. His exams are tough and require a lot of understanding but they will get you ready for the final exam and higher classes. ",1
"Definite GPA booster for me, can get 100% on online labs (MC Q's) if you compare answers with ppl. 3% survey bonus marks. Lots of recommended readings, but I barely did any of it (~5-6 pages altogether) and got 95%. Focus on online notes, learning obj, and video questions. Use textbook for reference, or when smthing is explicitly mentioned to know.",1
I felt like the course was taught fairly but the lack of transparency in the grading process is really unacceptable by modern standards. Its an enigma how he decides the grade you receive in the course and gives heavy grade bumps. If you are not willing to participate every class I suggest that you do not take Trust and Estates with him.,0
Does not answer emails. Late grader. Not a good professor.,0
"I was in a 3-hour long lecture and I did not learn anything. He gives and outrageous amount of reading and does not make sure that you genuinely understand the information. He isn't  very concerned with how you do in his class and takes attendance randomly by asking students to answer questions. It's a boring, frustrating class, would not suggest.",0
"Really intelligent and knows what he's talking about. Nice and accessible. Study for days for his exam because it's not something you can cram for the night before and expect an A. His study guides help a lot. Take really good notes bc the only way to get an A is to pay attention to what he says, not what's on the slides. I recommend him!",1
"Class was extremely difficult. Attendance is not mandatory and really does not help much other than that he might touch on a couple of conceptual points that may or may not help. Most of the learning needs to be done solving the book problems (Do as many as possible, not just assigned ones). He curves a lot but still easy to fail. Tough subject.",0
Melissa Benfield is a great teacher!  She is very nice and warm and cares about here students and wants you to do well.  She will answer questions and she is very clear.  If you do the work and follow the instructions you will do well.  I would take her again if I had the chance.,1
Poor clarification in regards to assignments given.  Class is boring and down not provide many benefits to the student.  Professor often contradicted what she was teaching by how she would act in and outside of the classroom.,0
Great professor overall super easy if you show up do your work and you'll get an A,1
terrible,0
"Online hybrid class - You read 2 chapters per week, and meet up once for a quick review, then you take a quiz. It is very well coordinated. Grading is test heavy. As for the instructor, she's very attentive & sweet. She'll comment on nearly everyones post on online discussions. You'll be in good hands. Personality wise, she seems pretty neutral.",1
"My favorite professor at DePaul. Wonderful writer, very engaging and funny, gives amazing feedback. Took time out from her busy schedule to help me with a piece I was working on independently. Grades are hard to anticipate, but she does her best to let you know how you're doing until your final portfolio is graded. TAKE HER.",1
"Would not take a class from him again. ECON201 should be simple, as it is still core principles being taught, but he made it extremely confusing. Exam material is not covered thoroughly in class, as he only touches on simple topics in lectures. Do yourself a favor and avoid",0
Horrible! Wanted to cry almost every time because his readings are so difficult to understand,0
For those of you that want to pass English 1A there are many other instructors that teach this class with the student's success in mind. Stay clear of this instructor unless you want to learn English within prison walls. You will buy many books that you won't use. Be prepared for boring lectures.,0
"Don't get me wrong, Andy is a great guy and is very passionate about religion. My main issue with Andy is that he can never stay on topic. He will start talking about a certain religious concept that may be important and then he will stop and tell a story about how his roommate forgot to buy milk for about twenty minutes. study on your own!",0
"Dr. Fontenot is a brilliant man.  However, he's incredibly intolerant when it comes to others' opinions and monopolizes the class discussions.  I don't recommend him, but if you must take him, just try to keep your mouth shut and do what he says.",0
Don't take him. Worst profesor ever! 3 weeks to hit finals and the only thing I learn was football. I'm so disappointed.,0
"Accelerated 2 mo. course. Very hard class. Wasn't much instructions throughout the course. More of a go do it, better be great at it or you're getting a bad grade. The amount of material you are expected to learn throughout this course is ridiculous! Quizzes are EXTREMELY hard! & do not try google. 4 Quizzes. 1 Research Paper. 5 Discussion Boards. ",0
"here are some my experiences with her: 1. She has an accent however, she is understandable 2. she goes into a lot of detail into topics 3. she does not give reviews to exams. but she does provide review topics on blackboard. 4. notes on board is unorganized 5. no extra credit work 5. exams are difficult. 6. no hw decent professor. Just pay attn",1
"Tove isn't very clear during her lectures and when you ask a question she gets easily confused and makes it ten times worse. The lectures are long and dry. She's an easy grader though, but just be prepared to teach yourself.",0
"ME 340 with Professor Brennan was one of the best classes I've taken at Penn State.  He is very clear in everything from his lectures to his expectations in terms of assignments.  He's also incredibly motivational; I always looked forward to going to class because even though the book is a little dry, he made the course interesting and enjoyable.",1
Great teacher! Very kind and hilarious. My final paper was written about the work environment of the tv show Parks and Rec. Definitely recommend her!,1
This class could be very interesting but there is too much unimportant information crammed into it that makes it confusing and unenjoyable. Dr. Palacios reads directly from her notes and talks very fast making it hard to follow. 80% of the grade came from two tests one of which was held on the last day of classes.,0
He honestly kinda terrified me? I took him at 8am and he put me to sleep. I'm sure if you like history it can't be that bad but for me a piece of paper was more interesting. He doesn't tolerate any fooling around and yelled at someone for asking about a Scantron. The test reviews were accurate and there's not a lot of grades.,0
"Business Communication Applications. Takes too long to grade, did not follow his own syllabus and didn't open modules on time. No lecture, no book, you basically learn on your own. Group project at the end was marketing oriented. I regret choosing his class. You will already know some of the content, like social media and blogging. Not worth it.",0
Took him for Trig Math 40 and he's a good professor. He lets you ask questions and he explains well. If you don't understand something he'll help you and he throws no curve ball on tests. Everything on his tests you will cover. Just make sure you do the study guides he gives or  you won't pass the tests unless you really understand the concept,1
She really helped out and explained more details about writing your paper. Never held her tongue when it came to informing you about a topic. I enjoyed her teaching and would definitely take her class again.,1
"i never had a great interest for astronomy, but i have always liked science. lots of information paced into this class. extra credit offered. 3 tests, lowest test is counted as only 15% of grade. 7 homework assignments that take about 1.5hrs each. homework 25% of grade. nice guy with lots of knowledge, it was hard to take in all the information.",1
I dreaded this class every day I had to go. I hated Mondays and Wednesdays because I knew I would have to sit in this class. DONT TAKE HER. im warning you. skip one class you will fail. She talks about stupid things just so time will pass and it will make you want to rip your hair out. Assignments are a waste of time and useless and so much work.,0
Dr. Gordon is hilarious in a cynical sort of way. If he's feeling nice he gives bonus points! He tells you what the essay questions are on the test and lets you have a note card. He gives hints as to the multiple choice but make sure and study for those. Book quizzes are easy if you write down the points he gave. Can't use phones or computers.,1
"Worst teacher ever. Studying in KPU from 2 years, never dealt with this kind of stupid teacher. Never take any course with this guy. Doesnt know ""C""m of coding just copying code from internet and showing videos. If the teacher is reading, I want to ask how data structure is related to AVENGERS movie budget.",0
"Professor Gonzalez is the funnest and most helpful professor I've ever had. His questionable sense of humor makes the class the highlight of my day. His assignments are super clear and he is always willing to help students. Come to class, participate, and do ALL your assignments and you'll be sure to pass!",1
DO NOT TAKE HER ONLINE! she will make your life a living hell!,0
This was the first class in college that I have ever flunked a paper. The writing lab stated they were able to identify no errors prior to turning in the paper.,0
THIS IS THE WORST CLASS I'VE EVER TAKEN. DO NOT TAKE HIM. He expects too much of his students and assigns really long papers.,0
"Kai Du is very hard to understand, and his teaching style is ridiculous. During class he'll write a few short-hand notes on the chalk board (even though there are 6 sliding dry erase boards available) and proceed to try to explain the information, which you probably wont understand, and so you MUST read and study the text book every night. GoodLuck",0
"Her expectations are unrealistic. It took myself and my fiance tag-teaming this course to get through it, my fiance is a teacher. Every week there are 6 writing assignments. There were so many links to so many different sources of information. It was absolutely ridiculous. If you are going back to school as an adult, you dont have time for this...",0
"Jeff Allen is the man. Keeps computer class entertaining which is hard to do. So laid back and relaxed. Great teacher, highly recommend him for CIS",1
"This class is the only intro class that I enrolled in, but is the hardest class out of my 5 classes. This class does not seem like an intro class and the professor grades too harsh. He gives broad essay prompts about our standpoints and gives responses stating that I should of included something that has nothing to do with my essay.",0
Goodyear made the topic extremely interesting.  I would take a class with him again.,1
Worst professor ever. He uses slides in his lecture that are dated 1999 and do not match up with his book which the homework and test questions come from.  He is arrogant and shoots down all questions asked.  Also keeps referring to taking Econ classes which I didn't and was not required.  He does not teach this as an Introduction to Finance.,0
"I would avoid taking this professor. She treats this class like a graduate class. Her tests are focused on if you know the in depth info, not just definitions. If you do have to take her, then I would definitely be proactive and read and take notes on before you talk about the chapters in lecture.",0
Marks is not a teacher I would recommend. All we do in class is read the book then do homework online which is not helpful at all. I hate going to class and he is a very tough grader. It has made me loathe Spanish this semester. He is nice but just not a good teacher.,0
"I found this course very hard and I regret take it because my GPA went down after taking it. The material is very heavy and hard to understand because its not clear about whats the course is! I am in a program of the education department and the course is EDUC, but it doesnt have anything with education. Do NOT take this course, VERY HARD!",0
GREAT TEACHER! Just go to class...,1
"Dr. Falk is the nicest professor that I have dealt with, but I had a hard time learning in this class. Every day I was so confused and did not know what I was writing down. The homework dealt with topics that are not even covered until a few class periods after they are due and the exam grades are always really bad in regards to the class.",0
"NOT an easy A kind of teacher. He will make u work 4 it! I got an A (thanks to xtra credit for perfect attendance). He gets frustrated if u question him too much or argue with him. My advice? GO TO TUTORING, stay quiet in clas (unless u have right answr) , good attendance  xtra credit, DO THE HW wa tutor!! He doesnt grade it, but it will help u! ",0
"Professor Liggin teaches a gateway class that converges Architecural students and Construction Management students. If you cannot read a set of blueprints, you should not be in that industry. He teaches the fundamentals that will help you succeed on your first day on the job. It is a super neccesary course and he is the best professor for it!",1
"I received 88-95s on every exam, yet even if I get a 100 on the final, I can not get an A in this class. Giant flaw in his grading system. He does not respond to emails. Exams are 95% of the class and homework is completion. He can be funny in class but also very sassy. Homework every night with videos that you are required to watch.",0
"Fox is great! I did her online course, she really knows what she is talking about but also grades pretty hard (on final portfolios). As long as you pay attention in class, ADD TO CONVERSATION, & read you will be fine. She didn't do traditional MC exams instead it's 4 projects due at the end of the semester. She just wants students to pay attention.",1
Essex county college need to put this professor full time he's very good i did not like math before because of him i can say I'm very good at it . very best professor ever i will have A for math 100.,1
"Professor is harsh and tyranny. DO NOT take you phone out in class, he will call you and throw you out. He is very dry and the material he covered was interesting, but his delivery was not. Easy class to pass if you do reading and come to class. No papers, and the final is not cumulative.",0
"Super easy, will drop quizzes if a majority of the class does poorly. Entertaining lectures because he's funny and really loves his subject.",1
Very hard course for a 200 level course. A ton of reading as for the quizzes even though it is open book the questions are extremely tricky. The VOH sessions in general are completely useless they do not provide any relevant information. I would not recommend this course.,0
"The king of ambiguity when it comes to big project requirements- you'll fly without radar until the last couple days before something is due, when he tends to finally drop a big hint about what he wants. If you can live with that, he's a great guy and his lectures are very interesting and informative. Talking to him in his office will always help.",0
"Professor Kenneth Leung is a great professor. Class was never boring, always made us laugh. Homework was super easy and he was always willing to help students. HE DOESN'T LET YOU FAIL! If you are stressed, sick, etc, he will let you take the test when you want, where you want! I recommend the professor!!!",1
"I like Professor Nurick, he is a nice guy. Seems to be genuinely interested in getting to know the students. Something about him makes you think you're gonna get an easy 4.0 in his class; this is NOT TRUE, make sure you actually put effort in your homework and group projects! Overall positive experience and highly recommended.",1
"Professor Ray is a very nice guy, however his class is a lot of work. There is a significant amount of reading, quizzes or discussion boards every week, a midterm paper, and a final paper and presentation. Out of all five books this semester I only took interest in one, which is a shame. Harsh grader too.",1
"Honestly, he was very interesting as a prof. He had trouble switching to online but the course is easy if you do the homework and make sure you are caught up on everything. It is one of those classes that stresses you out and sometimes the lectures could get confusing. Not an easy A but interesting class at least.",0
"Very unclear with instructions, has an attitude, gives mean facial expressions, lots of work, not specific, tough grader , boring class , would not take again",0
"He's sorta funny sometimes, the quizzes are alright. But dang does he suck as a teacher. You learn crap most of the time and he's super unclear about what he wants during the speeches. If you miss the smallest thing he'll drop you like 2 letter grades NO MATTER how good your speech was.",0
Do not take this class if you care about your GPA. He refuses to give out good grades and there are only 3 exams which are so difficult. Teachers like this should not have a job.,0
"Doctor Polanco wants her students to do well in the class; however, she gives SO much work to do out of class. Your grade for your speech does not come from just the speech; you have to do reviews & many other requirements. She is lecture heavy and quizzes/tests are very hard. She gives you 30 points on your final if you have perfect attendance.",0
"Sue Liebman is the most confusing teacher because she goes off the topic all the time. Secondly, she's slightly arrogant when she makes smart remarks when she critizes.",0
"Paula is a fantastic teacher for public speaking. She really cares about making sure we all have the tools to become good public speakers. She has funny stories, but also makes sure that she lectures everything we need to learn. There were four 2-3 min. speeches, and two 5-6 minute speeches. Stick to her recommended deadlines and you will be great.",1
"She was an amazing teacher! Just study your syllabus do your journal, and it is an easy ride. She brings an interesting side to your studies, a very interesting side!",1
"Olzman is extremely knowledgable on a wide range of topics discussed in class. You won't only get Communications knowledge, but you'll also learn a lot about social topics in the world. They're really a great human being and you'll be taught a lot about yourself. Show up and enjoy the class and you'll pass.",1
"Dr. Zbeida is a very good professor. She is caring and generous in her grading scale. There is alot of reading and writing essays, but then again, this is an English Comp class. It's to be expected. I would definitely recommend this professor. She is funny,lighthearted and accessible outside of class. Very approachable.",1
He uses his own material that is easily accessible. Exams are open-book but it really won't help because the problems can be really confusing at times.  Key to success- keep your head  and follow your instinct,1
"Gives candy out to everyone. Can be tough on grading, but teaches and explains things well. If he likes you, you'll get an A. Ask questions whenever possible, he'll help you. On final, he expects you to use all you've learn in class and use it on that.",1
"She is incredibly unfair in her grading and is not insightful in feedback. She constantly requires extra work beyond what is stated within in assignment directions or the syllabus. I still managed to have an A in the course but never again taking a class of hers. After talking to my counselor, she is frequently reported as unreasonable.",0
"He's a great instructor, has great lectures and gives you the materials you need to study for the weekly tests. He gives TONS of extra credit and drops your lowest test score. It's an extremely hard subject to learn but he does his best to make it fun! It does take him a while to get things graded so you're never really sure what your grade is.",1
"Dr. Barber is the worst at grading anything. You will not get grades back until the last week of class, so no feedback until it's too late. Every assignment's instruction is so confusing, and every assignment repeats every week. I don't think I learned anything in this class. I learned how to do busywork.",0
Great teacher! Very easy class and you learn a lot! No test only a final presentation and a 8-10 page paper. Grades easy! Very nice and understanding! I would take another class taught by her!,1
"She is so nice, but has NO common sense and will not answer questions in class.. that is for ""office hours"". She knows numbers, but her test are hard and she teaches the long and very very confusing ways of math. Definitely take another teacher!",0
"Adrianne is an unconventional professor with an experiential, feedback-based approach to teaching. The feedback she gives may be harsh, but it is unfailingly accurate. You will not realize until the end of the semester how much you have learned and grown as a visual storyteller.",1
"MA is the best professor at Clemson, their should be no question! She is great and actually prepares you, but by no means is it easy, you have to do your part! This isn't a good class if you are the type person that its always the teachers fault and never yours. A lot of the negative replies are these type people!",1
"Dr. Armstrong is a smart guy. He has been around and knows sociology like the back of his hand. I learned a lot about social class and society. But this was by far my worst class In Bloomsburg. His class overwhelmed me with anxiety, rude, derails from what he's talking about in lectures, he judges far too quickly, I leave the class feeling worse.",0
"Great teacher, super helpful and really nice. There were a lot of projects but if you followed the rubric then he was a pretty easy grader.",1
Excellent professor.  Great lectures and a great person in general.,1
"This course was made up of group projects, class discussions, and student participation. I'm glad I took this during winter intersession. It was a fun class and we discussed very interesting topics. Professor is reasonable, very friendly and knowledgeable. Grading criteria is also very clear. You will learn a ton about gene manipulation.",1
"Was very unclear, and not very willing to work with her students",0
She was the best english professor that I had. It was all papers. There was not a final exam. Papers are so much better than tests and that helped me a lot. She is always willing to help and she will let your correct papers until you earn the grade that you are happy with. I would recommend her for English 101 and 102.,1
The absolute worst professor ever. Professor graded my work very poorly. There was quite a great amount of work in regards to classwork and homework. I completed both and still somehowmanaged a poor grade. Dont take this guy. Im retaking Comp I.,0
"Based on the emails and Blackboard posts, he struck me as one of those professors who took pride in failing students. The exams are nothing like the homework and review sheets; the prerecorded lectures don't prepare you for either exam or assignment. It felt effortless on his part and based on most reviews here, this has been a pattern for a while.",0
WORST PROFESSOR I HAVE EVER HAD! She took forever to put the syllabus online. We were in week three and she still didn't have it up until the day of our second lecture. She expects you to read the book to find out all of the information you need. If you ask her a question she is going to tell you to look in her book. She expects you to self teach.,0
he is the worst,0
Neely is monotone and his class is done through video lecture. That is a terrible combination. A 100-500 word response on what you learned that week is due every week and he is not clear on what should be included AT ALL! Don't bother emailing him because he will be defensive and rude if you do not understand the requirements. Don't waste your time,0
She is a good teacher. She is a great photographer. I recommend this course.,1
"She was one of the easiest professors I've had so far. Once you know her opinions on the topics of the class (she makes them very clear in lecture) it's really easy to know what to write in your papers to get good grades on them. She can be pretentious, and the lectures are really boring, but always show up, attendance is a big part of your grade.",1
"I failed to see any practical value in having us ""simulate"" the activities we could use with our students, most of which revolved around the Consumer Gaze, which I do not use because I find it to be very high school and not exactly intellectual. Also felt Wendy had pre-packaged responses to any comment, so challenging her is out of the question.",0
He is rude and will treat the class like high schoolers. Threatening to take phones away and gets mad when you leave class to use the bathroom. Unless you already know the material you will not understand what he is teaching. He likes to over complicate things and will get mad if you use another method of solving a problem.,0
"Dr. Capper is an amazing professor. This course embodies what a college course should be in requiring you to apply yourself, take notes, attend class, and give a well written essay. It is easy to retain all of the information because of how he teaches in his lectures. There are no surprises on tests which makes studying easy!",1
"He was absolutely horrible, hes rude an mean, he threatened to grade our final assignment harder if we attempted to do part B of the exam if we dont understand it.",0
"Not a good lecturer at all, harsh grader, and made the class extremely theory based to the point you would just have to memorize everything and hope for the best. Tests were very difficult and he refused to curve or even let kids use formula sheets during the exam. If you're not a math major or naturally good at understanding theory avoid him!",0
"WORST CLASS. RUN.  He does not use clear lecture plans or visual aids. He is bias and does not allow for academic opinions outside his own. He does not teach this class as a 200 level, and comes off condescending during class time and private meetings.",0
I think Maria did a fantastic job. The class was interesting and she is a very interesting person and a great teacher. She is Russian and has an accent but I understood her perfectly and she articulates her engligh better than most americans. Love her,1
"She is very stern and means business, but she is willing to help you in anyway possible.  She really wants you to do well and if you put in the effort you will.  I would love to take another class by her again!!!!",1
"She is very intelligent about Chemistry,which is why she should NOT be teaching an intro class! She goes way too fast, does not explain stuff on a basic level, and if you ask for help she just confuses you even more. The tests are all online, which means you can google your way through,until the final (which is in class) where you fail. HARD TESTS",0
Loved every class Ive had with Mr. Williams,1
"I took Psychology 150 during the Fall and I have no complaints. Not many Zoom meetings but he provides very detailed PowerPoints for his lectures. As long as you do your part you should be fine! Everything on quizzes/tests, he mentions in his PowerPoints!",1
Two Exams. Super lazy professor. Doesn't seem to know how to use tech or online systems correctly. Tried to conduct the class via E-mail. Only good thing is that the class is based on two papers. But don't expect to learn anything through his lectures. It's a self teach type circumstance. Oh and he looks like Bob Ross. No joke.,0
"awful professor. if you are not white, heterosexual, and Christian please don't take this class. she will completely ignore the book and give you information based on her personal views. I've almost had to get up and walk out of class based on her remarks. class time is spent expressing hate and no actual learning. please do not take this class.",0
"As a word of advice do not take Mrs. Wang's summer Calc course unless you are currently an 'A' student in Pre-calc. Perfect attendance, good grades on homework and class participation  0 if you do not nail the tests. Earnest effort 0. The test scores are the only thing that matters. If you are not comfortable taking difficult tests-drop.",0
"really smart but down-to-earth guy, gives clear lectures and pretty laid back and likes throwing a few jokes here and there",1
"Easy class but prepare to write a lot. Three 5-page papers, weekly discussions, quizzes & a group project. The professor is completely MIA. Does not respond to emails or questions & won't grade anything until the end of class. He took points off my first paper & I made the same mistake on all my papers because he didn't grade until class was over",0
"Don't expect to know your grade ever. He is usually all over the the place and always cancels class. He grunts a lot too. But if you are struggling, he will help you, but only if you ask him for it. He gives a lot of extra credit though.",0
"Professor Berger-Hill truly loves teaching and seeing her students succeed! If you truly love sociology and want to learn a lot, she is for you. While she does give a good amount of work, it is always clear how and why it will help you better understand everything. Plus, I've been told her recommendations are magic! So, look no further.",1
"She is one of the sweetest and funniest women I have ever met. She knows everything and everyone. Listen to her when she shows you what classes to take in order to graduate/transfer. She is a great counselor! Yes, she cares and take about Puente a lot. I don't blame her, Puente Program is great and I'll forever be grateful for her and the program.",1
"Teaches out of the book, but does not understand what the book is teaching. Graded heavily by exams that are very difficult. Most of the class was failing, so he made the grade entirely dependent on the final which I got a C on. Extremely boring lectures, monotone.",0
"I love love love Jody. By the time I left this class, she felt more like a friend than a teacher. She has such a great sense of humor and a fun personality. Plus, she's an amazing teacher. She teaches really well and makes the most boring things easy to learn and fun. At this point, she's the best teacher I've ever had.",1
"He's very inconsistent with what he says in terms of assignment requirements, and seemingly has trouble both communicating what he wants out of assignments, as well as understanding the questions students ask. This was honestly the worst and least enjoyable course I've experience. The workload was HUGE (24+hrs of drawing per assignment)& hard marks",0
"If the class is online, don't take it. Ive heard he's better in person.",0
Words cannot describe how horrible this class is.She is completly unprofessional and dedicated in a cultish way to a belief system that shapes the entire class. readings were absurd and yoga useless. ruined the entire discipline for me. i am ashamed that a university like Duke supports this kind of shoddy teaching. AVOID AT ALL COSTS,0
"He's pretty redundant. Not much of a help, pretty much just a burned out bum.",0
"Rambles a lot in class which he describes as concrete examples to the theories but really he's just trying to showcase the fact that he knows a lot of things. He doesn't ""teach"". The worst part is class presence is mandatory but at least he lets you use your laptop so you can do other school work. Also, tough grader and without feedback.",0
"Professor Degen explains things thoroughly and in a way which keeps your attention. She asks often if anyone has questions and seems to legitimately want her students to grasp the material. She is very approachable and willing to help. Homework questions are difficult (which I dont mind so much). Test are pretty easy, with plenty of time allowed.",1
"First off, he's a nice guy with a big heart. However, Vallee is very unclear about his expectations. He is a very poor marker; no constant b/w projects/reports. If course material was presented differently, it would make for a much more enjoyable term.",0
"Dr. Rogers is caring and helpful! Her lecture is amazing, try to attend every lecture you will get 5%. Try to take her course, and you wont regret your decision! Sometimes there will be some problems about grade calculations. Dont hesitate, come to her office hours and tell her your situation! Miracles will happen!",1
His exams are super hard and gives extra credit but its not enough. Rewatch lectures multiple times to pass,0
"Class was really good. Theres alot of writing, but Mr. Molnar gives you a lot of freedom to write want you want. We spent alot of time on individual papers and that really helped improve them. The novel was really good and he really helped me understand it.",1
"Nan is a tough grader, but it's definitely possible to get an A in the class if you work for it. You write three news stories, I got above a 90 on all of them - bring your rough drafts to her office hours and she'll tell you exactly what to fix. Her lectures are sort of boring, but there are no tests! Pretty easy!",1
"Great Professor. Very intelligent in terms of US politics. Really nice guy, would recommend taking one his classes (which are also extremely interesting and relevant).",1
"Professor Maria will not put up with disrespect. Homework is tough without a tutor to help. She informs her Students' what will be expected on her Exams. She is a tough grader when it comes to her memos for her individual Project. If you keep in contact with her she will help you pass as long as you keep up with Homework and, her Tutoring Session!",1
The workload is rigorous but Dr. Jones keeps you inspired and motivated enough to get it done. It's obvious that she cares about her students and that her number one priority is to prepare you for the remainder of the program and for your career. Great professor.,1
Loved this class!,1
Awful experience in the course,0
"Horrible communication plain and simple. The mid term took two weeks to get a grade on. Our final was Dec 16th. The final grade was just uploaded today, Jan 3rd. I still haven't gotten a reply to my email about my final exam. Saving grace is that the homework was super easy. According to the grades, my HW was 85% of the overall and exam 5?Wrong lol",0
She is probably the most easy going person I've ever met. Her expectations are clear from the beginning and she's ALWAYS willing to meet with people to work on speeches or read through an essay. Her lectures are entertaining and the in class activities are fun-ish. If a student doesn't understand a concept she finds ways to clarify the topic.,1
"HIS LECTURES ARE BORING, AND HE'S NOT THE BEST AT EXPLAINING PHYSICS. HE LIKES TO CRAM THE TEST REVIEW THE NIGHT BEFORE THE EXAM.BATMAN POSTS HOMEWORK EVERY 2 DAYS. YOU ALSO HAVE A QUIZ OR A TEST EVERY FRIDAY. FINALLY HE DOESN'T BELIEVE IN SECOND CHANCES, WHICH MEANS HE DOESN'T REPLACE THE FINAL TEST GRADE WITH THE LOWEST TEST.NO GRADES DROPED.",1
I'm not sure she realizes that online courses are still supposed to be between Monday and Friday. She has things due on Saturdays at 8 am which makes absolutely no sense. Asking way too much out of students given the nature of the class. Find a different professor/class. She & the excessive coursework are not worth your time.,0
On tests he chooses the most difficult problems and tries to make his tests as hard as possible when they shouldn't be. His tests are much much harder than the homework and quizzes. He makes his tests as hard as possible.,0
"A sweet person but her teaching style is pretty awful. Despite the pandemic, she has actually made it more difficult to complete this course and has been kind of insensitive to the course load that her students have. Since then we have essentially been teaching ourselves, while she continues to assign things while still not grading past assignments",0
"She's great honestly, I think she is an amazing Professor. I'm so glad I got the pleasure of meeting her, if you see her name anywhere for classes take it I swear you won't regret it. She's kind, and cares about her students, loves her job and pays close attention to everyone. Take her course !",1
"I could go on and on. First day of class she claims she doesn't have horns growing out of her head, but I quickly realized that was a lie. She is soo rude and expects so much out of you. The quizzes and exams aren't bad but the paper that is worth 30% of you grade is ridiculous. She expects you to be a damn architecture. Strongly DO NOT recommend.",0
"This dude is awful, has a thick African accent, lacks modern teaching techniques. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS .  Should go back to tutor school. ",0
Ms. M was a great teacher. Not very interested in subject but made it very bearable. PowerPoints have lots of info but all of it is needed to build concepts. Replaces lowest grade with attendance % if it helps you. Emails back very quickly and easy grader. Extra credit available. Very nice and approachable. Really - a great prof! Recommended.,1
"By far the most difficult class I've taken thus far. 100% online due to current circumstances, Zoom says her connection is bad and it's been brought to her attention multiple times, but she refuses to fix it so you cannot understand most of what she says. This class is undoubtedly the most painful I've taken in many years.",0
"CPCC got hacked on Feb 2021, the public speaking class was already virtual due to covid, plus it was an 8 week course, then the attack. Once the school got back online Ms. Noland HELPED the students get back on track. Ms. Noland made an impossible situation bearable. She was for the students! not against. PLEASE take her class she is THE best! LOVE",1
"I had her for Writing & Rhetoric II, she did say we needed the textbook, she only assigned about two chapters to read and there was no penalty for not reading them so you can definitely get away with not purchasing the book Grade is affected by attendance, but it's also important so you understand the assignments. Lots of discussion and peer review",1
"Super informative, pleasant voice to hear for lectures. Her quizzes are straight-forward. You have to study a little but it's not terribly hard.",1
You really will work for your grade more than any other class honestly. Try Not to take her class if you have a lot of other classes as well her class requires a lot of time. Studying is mandatory as well good luck youll need it.,0
"He is an alright teacher.  His talks can be boring, but he breaks it up with interesting videos or real world things he notices.  He def knows his econ. He's also flexible and understanding.",1
very helpful,1
"Like most art history profs, she shows slides of the artworks and then talks about them. The course content is interesting, but sometimes the lectures feel long. You don't need to do the readings regularly, but they are useful for the essays if you scan through them. This is an easy course and it's good to attend for content on your essays.",1
"Walks around and disappears for periods during class. Need help? Try not to, she has a hard time focusing and giving advice on how to improve a project. Not much help when learning things on the wheel which happens at the end. Gives suggestions for how she would complete a project even if it isn't the best way.",0
"I took her Spring 2016, she started out on a good road but went completely left at the end. She actual taught the last two weeks of the semester. When she began to teacher she was giving a crash lesson. She believes you should be a professional writer not thinking this could be a class you have not taken in thirty years.",0
"if you really want an easy A without really learning anything then take his class. If you really want to learn the material to prepare yourself for a University then please avoid him. He doesn't even know his own material, make several mistake during with his own code, which he ask student for help. Sometime lecture is not even related to the class",0
This guy is honestly the worst teacher . His book Has so many errors and is all over the place never staying on topic . He grades liked his book is on New York Times bestsellers and we should agree with everything his writes . Honestly dont ever take the class .,0
Zein is probably the worst grader I have heard of. She shoots down questions in class and often rushes through classes in order to finish her lecture. Avoid getting her at all cost.,0
"I loved having Prof. Lalonde this semester. He used pre-recorded lectures, but kept them short and casual. Along with a little textbook reading, this class is not hard at all. He's also pretty funny and just an all around great dude.",1
I wish this professor luck b/c I have one semester left and I am so glad I don't have to take any more classes with him.  Good luck to his future students!,0
"Even though it was online I enjoyed this class a lot! I feel like I actually learned things & she is super sweet & her online lectures were very helpful. She provides helpful feedback and the rubrics are super clear, this was one of the easiest A's I've ever gotten! Def take this class if you can, I adore her!!!",1
Excellent work!,1
"He's a fossilized piece of animal dung, worst notes ever, hardest tests ever, absolutely no respect for students.  Goes out of his way to make you feel like an idiot if you ask him a question or answer one of his.  Curses technology when he can't figure out that you need to plug the cart INTO THE WALL, NOT BACK INTO THE CART.  PLEASE RETIRE.",0
Hes an okay teacher. He's passionate about the topics and lectures are pretty interesting.  However nothing is ever graded on time. He will grade everything on the last day of class so you have no idea how you're doing throughout the semester. Also grading is VERY inconsistent.,1
I am a worse person from meeting her. She constantly berated my ideas in both seminar and on my papers. I am a b+ to an A student and I barely passed her classes. she is a tough grader and picks faves. AVOID HER AT ALL COSTS. she caused me to have a mental breakdown in first semester of my second year because she constantly made me miserable.,0
"Honestly shes a really great teacher. The only thing is that mid semester she will pile on so many assignments and takes forever to grade them, but if you ask questions she'll help you so much! My best advice is get help she'll tell you exactly what she wants and you're set. she'll thrown in extra credit here and there as well.",1
"okay, yes he is tough. But Wilson really WANTS each person to succeed. If you're willing to seek him out for help - help for ANYTHING:no matter how small - he makes the time to work with you on it. Loves to help you, but makes sure YOU do the work.",1
Her lectures are very interesting but not really that helpful for exam preparation. She basically expects you to learn everything by yourself so she's able to talk about the extra things that ultimately are unimportant. She never explains how to do questions but only goes through the answers because she expected you to learn it yourself.,1
"If you study as days go by as how he throws questions on his exams. You will be just fine. Some of his questions on his exams are repetitive, but different numbers as you take next exam, especially piecewise defined functions. If you don't pass his exams, you'll have a chance to correct them and math center will help you if you don't get it.",1
"Great teacher! I had him for nonverbal communication.  He is sort of a hard grader on written work.  Also there is a super annoying group project.  The class had 4 exams, two video response papers, and a group project.  Attendance in mandatory. You need the books to do well on tests.",1
This class has more assignments and harsher grading than any programming class. I would rather retake programming classes than deal with this class ever again.,0
She doesn't accept any late credit and gave an essay on the first week of class. I can't stress how unforgiving she is when a student makes a mistake. I wanted to take this class so that I could learn something about English but instead I can't stop myself from being discouraged because I missed an essay and now can't make up for it. 2/10,0
Real easy on the eyes.  Hubba hubba.,1
"Class was super easy, he really challenged you to think how a business owners thinks which is very interesting as well as fun.",1
"She takes forever to grade things. It took her a month to grade simple quizzes to test. She waits until the semester is up to grade. She does not give extra credit, and does not help you when you mess up. She does not care if you fail. I never had a teacher like her. She is a tough grader on her papers. Takes forever to get a reply back. ",0
"Pros: Knows the content, Good at giving lectures, Replies to emails promptly. Cons: NO STUDY GUIDES! NO FEEDBACK ON EXAMS! (i.e. missed questions), 20%+ Fill-in-the-blank on all exams (Better know how to spell all your enzymes!). It is just cruel expecting a student to be able to do well in a medical-based class with those 3 cons combined.",0
Hardest course I've ever taken!!!,1
I was warned not to take Smith but I decided to do it anyway and it was a mistake! His lectures are so long and dry and makes the material more confusing. The final is 70% of your grade and sometimes it's unclear what type of answers he's looking for. Avoid and take this class with a different prof if you can !,0
"He is not an easy professor, but he is very straight forward and willing to help. He may seem mean at first, but as long as he sees you trying and working hard he will do anything to help. His lab test are very straight forward and as long as you study you'll do well!",1
"This instructor is terrible at getting back to students, grading, and completely unorganized. This was the worst course I have ever had. I would not EVER take a course from this instructor.",0
"Dropped, do not recommend. You will not learn anything from this prof. How he became a prof is beyond me.",0
"If you want to learn what an anecdote is by listening to someone talk about the motorcycle helmet laws in West Virginia for an hour, then Hetrick is your man! All joking aside,  Professor Hetrick is a really good guy who wants you to pass.  His grading is kind of strange, but as long as you put some effort into the paper, you'll be fine.",1
"I took 4 years of Spanish in high school, and I learned more in 10 weeks with Marks than I did in the past 4 years.  The Wiley Plus (on-line assignments) is annoying at times, but I do not mind going to class.  He explains everything really well, and although he is a tough grader at times, you will still learn a lot and do good if you actually try.",1
"Wonderful professor, inspired great interest in the subject. One of the best professors I've had.",1
"I basically taught myself this entire course. He wrote the book himself so it didn't make any difference to go to his class. The material is already so dry, his monotonous voice made even worse. Nice prof but my GPA suffered from this class.",0
"*This course was taken during the Spring 2020 Covid-19 pandemic* Prof. Davidovitch would be much better suited to teach graduate level courses than a second-year physics course. His lectures were confusing and too fast-paced, assuming students already knew more than they did. A great person, but made the course material too difficult.",0
"This is my second class with this professor. There are a few quizes and 3 exams. He also offers an optional bank case that replaces your lowest exam grade. If you need to contact him, do so through his FIU email. He definitely helped me out when i missed an exam because i was in the ER. He reopened the exam the next day.  Exams are a little tricky.",1
"He is very nice.  He will make you feel like he is judging your every move.  He will appreciate any contribution you make to discussion.  His syllabus, yes, is outdated and his grading is harsh, and he will try to make you care about stupid literature which no one cares about.  There is a lot of writing, and little room for extra credit.",0
"Lots of extra credit. Don't wait until the last minute. Follow the due dates and you will be fine. Small group readings and one group project. I hate writing and reading, but was still able to pass the class with an A. Again do the papers on the due dates, you get the opportunity to resubmit the paper. This was a Saturday class.",1
"hey guys, anyone whose had her for bio med/soc issues...how are the exams? does anyone have old ones? she is very cool so far.",1
"Having prof. Current online was honestly a really bad experience. I dreaded this class and its outdated materials and lectures - I was bored out of my mind most days. Assignments were pointless or confusing, as was the Canvas page. Most frustratingly, he showed an unwillingness to listen to the concerns and ideas of students. I'm so glad to be done",0
"If you aspire to be a poet (do they even exist anymore?), or would like to experience what it feels like to learn English inside prison walls, then this is the adjunct warden for you. GOOD LUCK!",0
Avoid at all costs. For context I am in the honors program and was a straight A student. Ive had hard profs and classes before. But she is a gpa crusher. She doesnt care about any student. Terrible teacher. Wont learn and will be punished for it. Avoid this professor,0
Professor Khan is a great teacher. She gives writing assignments that are not difficult to do and many of them are interesting. Tons of group work and opportunities for extra credit. She is caring and understanding and brings goodies (snacks) to class. Do well and keep up with assignments and you'll get an easy A. I would definitely take her again.,1
"Professor Westover is very knowledgeable. I also think he is respectful, responds to questions right away, and definitely gives feedback about student performance in a timely manner. He is a great teacher, especially for those on the HR track.",1
"I had professor Wolfe a semester ago , he didn't just made class fun but he made the class feel so welcomed , compared to the other class i have and experienced myself , he loves teaching and loves inspiring his student with his knowledge, Take him!! you wont regret it!",1
"I was expecting this class to be decent as my last class prior to the semester I took this one was very good and I had a professor who gave me good feedback and clear instructions. Professor Makri does not give clear feedback or instructions, yet hands out low grades anyway. Would never take another class hosted by her again. Terrible experience.",0
"The tests are hard and really test your complete knowledge on the readings and class. But, Dr. Britton is always there to help and also are the GTAs. So, if you don't like your grade, there is a place to go to help you with study strategies, answer questions, and clarify content!",1
Read straight from the powerpoints all semester and did nothing to make the class interesting. Attendance is mandatory so you actually have to sit through the class.,0
Overall she is pretty awesome. The class is easy and not boring because you learn out of the book not a boring PowerPoint and she makes everything interactive with the class so you learn how to speak aloud usually with a partner.,1
"If you want to be ""taught"" by someone who's in love with her so-called education in feminine and gender studies and makes everything in class about that, you'll love her! She's all about politics and her personal social agenda. Disagree and and she resorts to threats. Technically vacuous, so learning degenerated to self-study. Worst in my lifetime.",0
Gives you quizzes on things you didn't learn and grades them really hard. She's terrible please don't take her this is the biggest waste of a class i've ever taken. The class is 3 hours long and she barely gives you a 5 minute break and gets off topic onto the worst tangents then blames students for not knowing material. DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS!,0
Shes a really good professor,1
"If this class was physical it would have the best one. But due to the current events (Covid-19) this class has turned out to be disastrous. When everything became online you would expect zoom lectures like other professors do. However, Professor McFaul refused to ""adapt"" and instead kept sending long emails continually to cheer us.",0
Really relatable and responds to emails very quickly.,1
"The tests DO NOT match the reviews. If you are taking this class as a requirement and know most of the material already, it's straightforward (tests/hw only). He doesn't ""teach"". He works out a problem of every kind in the chapter (whether you need it on the test or not-overload of info) . He does this quickly & with no patience for questions.",0
Seemed like a good guy. Was willing to stay late with students like me who wanted to really get this stuff.,1
"I took 27 and 20 from Thana. He picks good texts from top universities. His lectures are detailed. Best CIS lecturer in Peralta. He assigns homework that is too hard and there really aren't resources available to help the students. I teaches at a university level but we skip lab and don't have discussion, GSI's or tutors. He knows the material.",1
"The homework is really easy, but the tests are really hard. She doesn't make her tests, since they are through connect so it is not really her fault. She answers emails quickly and has lectures on youtube if you need them.",1
"He is a great TA. He cares that you learn the material, helps beforehand during exams and quizzes. I would definitely suggest taking his discussion class.",1
The class is a great experience but I find the Professor to be very condescending. He likes to belittle students. The quizzes are very hard read the chapters that are assigned.,0
"Professor Liu is an extremely tough grader. The reading assignments are  long and difficult to understand at times, but this class really broadens your knowledge on the complexities of restoration ecology. The tests are much harder than they need to be, extremely specific. Overall, not terrible, but she makes you work for your grade. ",0
"I honestly don't know if she's a good teacher or not. She was extremely late giving back work and grading assignments and didn't respond well to inquiries regarding assignments. Additionally, none of the dates or assignment values matched when looking at the syllabus versus the actual assignments. Really disappointed.",0
He tends to grad differently for each student. He is very loose on what he actually wants. He will also allow some students to turn in late work but not others.,0
"DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR. Three tests and a final. THAT'S IT. No quizzes so you don't know how you are doing before the tests, and the tests are only 3 questions. Barely any partial credit, so one question wrong and you have a bad grade. Very smart guy, but cannot get on the students level to teach properly. Flies through the material.",0
"Very hard professor. He wants you to learn and will help you by answering questions in class. Labs are very hard and he will not give strieght forward answers during lab. Exams are super hard, and grading of them is harsher. Power points put you to sleep unless you take notes whole class.",1
"He gives quizzes every time before class, and sometimes he gives homework as he want you to be particitate in class. Also, he gives project problem that you need to work on. However, he said the final exam will be the same question in the quizzes.",1
Such a boring class. Tests are almost impossible and takes forever to grade.,0
Professor Katner's lectures in class are very fun and she spends a lot of time explaining more difficult material. I highly recommend attending lectures as often as possible. You will get participation points from clicker questions and learn a whole lot! There are two major exams that make up the majority of your grade. Find a study buddy!,1
"This was the hardest class i have had so far in CBE. If you do not have old tests, you will not pass. The old tests have EXACTLY the same questions as the tests he gives you. I found this out halfway through the semester so my test scores went from a 30 to a 80. HW can easily take 10 hours per assignmt even w help. HW is EXACT same every year.",0
"She is a wonderful teacher that allows the student to take control of her/his homework. Without the pressures of deadlines and over complicated assignments I was able to focus on what matters, learning and really knowing the subject material. I appreciate Rebecca Laro's teaching style because I can simply enjoy coming to class and learn new things.",1
"Brown is the WORST teacher at Ball State and is what is wrong with the fitness industry. He is sexist and ignorant. The first half of the semester you have 5 point quizzes twice a week, but the last three weeks of the semester you will have TWO HUGE projects that will drop your grade. He grades so hard, especially because he teaches you nothing.",0
"Class was supposed to be on inductive logic, though we didn't cover much of that. Not really a way to fulfill math requirement. West got off topic a lot and seemed more into trying to entertain than teach. Easy A, but don't expect to learn much.",0
"Stewart is so hilarious, he has a really dry sense of humor that made an otherwise dull subject matter pretty engaging. I wouldn't advise skipping class, as you'd get behind quickly. I would say that he doesn't give that much feedback on essays, which can be frustrating if you want to improve between draft & final. Very sharp guy.",1
Easily the best professor I've had. Made the content seem simple. Good guy in general.,1
"Really nice teacher. Class can be boring seeing as he reads off the powerpoint, but he will be helpful if you have any questions. He is a CPA so he is knowledgeable in the material, just has no teaching skills. Tests & assignments are simple, class is a breeze! Easy A!",1
"This class is awful.  Instructor is dumb.  She is so unorganized.  Notes that she post are horrible and you can't follow them during a lecture. I honestly can say that I have never had a worse instructor.  RUN, DON'T WALK AWAY FROM THIS CLASS.",0
"If you have to take Art Appreciation, I would 100% recommend Professor Hopkins. She is an amazing professor who is extremely inspirational and deeply knows what she is talking about. There is only one project which you have to present, extremely easy to do. There is only about 4 assignments in the entire semester. She gives extra credit too!",1
"If you read the text book you will pass easily. She goes off topic every single lecture. She gives out A LOT of pointless assignments such as crosswords, fill in the blanks, etc. but because she gives out a lot most of them are extra credit. Only negative is her personality, she treats people like children and talks down a lot.",1
"She's crazy, but awesome...",1
I really enjoyed taking his class. He presents the lectures in fun and easy way. I wish that he teaches academic classes not only ESL classes because I learnt so much from him. Such a great professor.,1
Amazing professor.,1
"She will hate you if you are ever tardy, just skip, trust me. She doesn't understand american customs very well and is probably not the best person to be teaching 101. Understanding under certain circumstances. This class is about equivalent to a spanish 201",0
"Love love love her! Go to class, take down notes (she won't post all the powerpoints to her content section), and complete the test study guides to pass. She's very energetic and is great at getting her point across. I will be taking another (and hopefully more) class with her next semester.",1
"The class is discussion heavy and he will try to make quieter students participate. If there was ever an issue with the class or a question came up, he was easy to reach outside of class. The class covers a lot of topics and he goes into detail on various aspects of the readings, which makes class fast paced and enjoyable.",1
Sinha seems fine until you take your first midterm and realize that you know absolutely nothing. She goes through the slides at 60mph and barely gives students a chance to see it. Her clicker questions are challenging and sometimes don't even make sense. I would not recommend.,0
Its a class that makes you work mentally. There are a TON of dense 30-50 pg readings almost overnight. You need to read them to understand what is discussed in class. I almost failed the class and but worked hard and passed with a breeze. Danny is an AWESOME guy. He does however take forever to reply to emails. I would recommend the class.,1
"She's very knowledgable and understanding. She is accessible outside of class, and all assignments are straightforward. She's enthusiastic and cares about her students.",1
"He seems like a very nice guy, but that truly does not outweigh the insane amount of classwork he gives each week. He is also completely inaccessible outside the classroom, and will take off 1% point from your final grade if you email him something that could be discussed at office hours. PSU offers a variety of ECON courses, TAKE ANOTHER ONE.",0
"Just Awesome. The best professor I have ever taken. Keeps lectures entertaining, and tests and quizzes come straight from the power points. Would definitely take this course again if I could. The book is important for the reading assignments that might be asked on the quizzes and exams.",1
Li Liu is homework heavy and her class is incredibly boring. It does feel like a chore and attendance is mandatory for a good participation grade in the class. 10/10 would not recommend this class.,0
great guy!!,1
"Brown is THE WORST professor I have ever had. He singled out all Athletic Training Students and told us our major is useless. He also knocked our grades lower than  exercise science students. In front of the class, he told us we were dumber than everyone else. He won't admit he's wrong and doesn't know basic anatomy. Do not take class with him.",0
"Juan teaches a required 1st semester m-tech course. Be prepared for a professor who really doesn't give a heck about students, and gives confusing mixing advice and nonsensical tests. just keep your head down and you should pass fine. He won't take the time to remember your name.",0
"Up to date in technology, but not in life. He's a very nice man. Very punctual with class. To put it simply, the door is unlocked at 1:59:59pm, & locked at 2:00:00pm. I got along fine with the book & MyITlab, & when I had questions, he would come over & try to help. (TRY) You pretty much teach yourself. But he is polite, I'll give him that much.",0
"I don't like science but Mark List made it easy. You will need the textbook for the homework,he is pretty lenient of accepting late assignments & still gave full credit. The exams were easy as long as you review the clicker questions and there is at least 1 pic with terms on the exam. He also rounds up.",1
"GREAT! She is really easy and flexible. She accepts late assignments. One research paper, one group presentation and response paper every week. Take her. I  would say it's an easy A.",1
"He's funny.. that's about all the positives I can give. He goes on and on about a subject and then says ""But that won't be on the test"", so basically he wastes like 20 minutes on a single subject that won't even be on the test. His lectures are sloppy and unorganized, and if you ask a question he probably won't understand what you're asking.",0
"This class is ridiculous! It has nothing to do with philosophy more of an english class. The professor is extremely boring and attendance is a MUST if you wish to pass. There's hwk due every first lecture, quiz the next, and another quiz in your discussion. WAYYYY too much for a lower div class.",0
Very disorganized. Class work isn't difficult but is useless and expectations are not clear. Out of date information taught. No grades were give until the end of the course. Did not learn anything I didn't already know going in to the class.,0
"He keeps the lectures entertaining. Can't really say to much about his grading-- he uses TAs. Ended up with a C+ in the class, but I hate Shakespeare. So, don't take if you're not even remotely interested in the subject.",0
He is by far the worst professor I have ever taken. All he does is wastes people's time with the stupid videos he plays which are unrelated to the topic.,0
HE IS A TRUE GEM.  Cares for his students way too much! He's hilarious too!  So easy! TAKE HIM! You won't regret,1
"try to stay away from TTS for Chem 111. I wasnt very into her class from the start, and because of that her mediocre teaching had no effect on my learning. i remember getting an 83 on my first quizor exam, then just downhill from there. try to get Vining for any Chem course he teaches (including 111 I believe)",0
Abosolutely cool,1
"He is really nice, enthusiastic, passionate and knowledgeable. Lot of writing and reading. First two assignments are group projects which make up 30% of your grade. He has everyone fills out a survey after the project is complete and he adjusts each persons grade. you can raise your final grade by 1/3 by writing more than the 7,001 in your journal",1
"Dr. Poole is a good choice for a psychology course. Everything is based on the textbook, so study that. You should have a pretty good grasp on concepts. Questions can be a bit confusing to understand, but such is university.",1
"Monika's a nice and caring prof. Every day in class is a bit meh, tho. We'd come in then she'd tell us to take out our travaux pratique then she'd literally call on us one by one to answer each response and it was a bit of a pain and boring. But she is nice and gives decent explanations. She is super willing to explain things outside of class!",1
"Dr. Mathis is an amazing professor. I'm shocked to see negative reviews. If you listen and show up for class, you'll be fine. She's a tough grader but teaches you how to write papers better. I have nothing negative to say. She is sweet, intelligent, and will love you if you do your work.",1
"Nice dude, but you dont learn anything in his classes!",0
he aight,1
"Why are you worried about taking this class/professor? You're a senior at WSU! You should know how to write proper English regardless of your background. I want to take this challenging course and professor. I want to learn. AND, he helps you if you ask. Want to go to grad/med school? Take this course. He will help you. Yes, he helps YOU. Thanks.",1
"You definitely need the textbook in this class and also come to class because he talks about everything you read in the book. He's an easy grader. This class is an easy A, as long as you do the online homework which is read a chapter of a textbook and makeup and answer 3 questions. He's very nice but he just very strict on all electronic devices.",1
You will lose your mind if you know zip about computing science or programming and attend his lectures. Prepare to study a lot outside of class to understand the material.,0
Very hard to pass,0
"Show up to class, He will literally tell you whats on the tests/quizzes so take notes, lectures are actually pretty good as well",1
Professor Woods is a great teacher!,1
She was always sick and blowing her nose. Other than that very kind and understanding.,0
She is the best Math teacher ever. Took her for two semester and she is awesome. yes there are lots of quizzes and homework but there easy and its builds up your final grade. she wants her students to succeed. TAKE HER!!!,1
"Good natured prof, quite knowledgeable, tests are challenging but you can get a good mark",1
Taken as an iCourse. Extremely easy class. Do the Yellowdig discussion posts/replies on time and you're fine. Multiple attempts allowed on very easy quizzes. Only complaint is that it was TOO easy - the only use of Stata was watching a recording of the professor using the software.,1
"I've always learned better when things are explained to me, she doesn't give you any specific reading as to what will be needed for quizzes or tests, you literally have to read the entire chapter, which means you'll eventually end up reading the entire textbook. no reviews are given, no study guides and some of the tests were very difficult.",1
"Shes a very nice person, However as a full timer living at my moms with no job, Its alot for me! I have other courses and it seems all I have is math. Way to much homework. 3 assignments will be due in such short time, test are graded heavily I don't understand why some points come off. She made me cry with a failing grade I tried hard!",1
"An insightful class that changed my perspective on the world. Take good notes outside of what is on handouts and on lecture slides, such as examples he gives, and you are likely to succeed. Study guides reflect the exact material that is on the test. Study that and you will be fine. Prof. Goldiner is inspirational & truly a gem of a teacher.",1
"He live streams and records his lectures so you don't have to attend in person. He has good examples and I had a good understanding of the material. Seemed like he had other priorities this semester. Didn't send out ANY grades for our labs/hw. Often canceled class or said ""online class today"" like 3-4 hrs before class and was late a lot too, idk",1
He is a nice guy but should not be a professor. He does not teach anything and expects people to know the material before we even mention it in class. His idea of teaching is going over problems that we have not learned yet. Avoid him if you can. The only saving grace to taking him is the curves you will get since the tests are so hard.,0
"Took him for my Spring2020 semester, definitely struggled since I'm bad at math, he required labs and that helped a bit, because of a previous comment on him on this site attendance was mandatory. Our class converted into online because of quarantine, don't think I would have survived if it wasn't for that if I'm being honest. Hw/book online.",1
He is very partial teacher. He just gives opportunities to students who are doing research under him or whom he knows. He is very bad for others.,0
"Great teacher, one of the very few whom I miss since graduation",1
"I took her class online and she never really taught. She gave quizzes every day, which were easy, and on the topic from the chapter, her test, on the other hand, were not always over the chapter or notes. Her test are also with webcam and if you make any little movement or noise she would take points off. She is not understanding and does not help",0
A little arrogant--as far as I'm concerned.  Question:  What have you published .. . REALLY?!?,1
"I would not recommend Professor Jewell to anyone. She does not teach much or give  helpful information, or relevant information. She loses papers and gives you a zero grade. Doesn't help with research paper assignment - you're on your own. Doesn't answer emails and is not accessible to students.",0
"This guy is terrible. I'm a ME major, this course is needed, and I have never gotten below a 84 in any previous math class. Makovers handwriting is bad, he jumps all over the place, he'll change numbers in examples or put an equation into mathmatica if he can't figure it out, and he goes way to fast. Avoid him at all costs.",0
One of the least caring professors I have ever encountered. He. Does. Not. Care. He is downright rude to students. I once mistakenly addressed him as Mr. instead of Dr. and he replied very rudely. AVOID!,0
Hardest class I ever took! I dont know how people do well in this class. So much to read! I read multiple times and took notes on everything and would still fail tests. He gives so many tests!!!,0
"Old school prof. While I don't mind an old school prof, and everyone teaches differently, this man reeked of pompous arrogance. His class was him ensuring everyone realized his importance. 50% midterm on an Econ elective to a fourth year class, and a rude class-wide email responding to the low average. 8000 word essay. Needs to check ego at door!",0
"First totally online classes, and still learned a lot. This professor is very chill and realistic about homework and quizzes. pay attention and do the quizzes you will pass.",1
"I am so upset that I had Dr. Armstrong as a professor. I felt so disrespected and uncomfortable. He is rude to his students and obviously picks favorites. I felt like I could never come to him with anything, he was also my advisor and I had to switch. Even if you aren't a sensitive person, no professor should treat their students like this.",0
all you have to do is show up one day a week and spend maybe 30mins-1hr in the lab he helps guides you to what you need to do and just take little quizzes each Friday and you'll pass!,1
She's a great teacher! Extremely easy and doesn't place much emphasis on writing. More so on understanding the topic and analyzing it. Lots of group interaction too.,1
Her class starts with meditation and ends in fulfillment. She inspires you to read and ensures your participation through online and in-class activities. Her projects prepare you for upcoming challenges. The 5K you pay for her class is easily worth 50K in uni itself and over 500K in career. Money can't buy you a better class and a greater mentor.,1
always available for extra help and she is a great motivator,1
"a horrible professor and a horrible person, holds no regard to her students or those around her, grades inconsistently with no explanations doesnt respond to emails or even texts dearborn should just drop her",0
Amazing. very sweet and super caring if you ever need an extension. class is super easy and fun. but also very interesting and attention drawing,1
"Sanda was amazing! She is one of the directors on the VCD Board so she knows her stuff and will be very helpful and attentive to you. She is a hard grader (only gives one A) but it is worth it, she pushes you and constantly brings in examples.",1
"Harsh, unapproachable, avoid taking her classes.",0
"She is literally the worst teacher I have ever had. Her unprofessional and hostile attitude are sort of shocking level. In my opinion, this program, especially in the clinical part, does not constitute and organized well.",0
DROP THE CLASS IF YOU EVER GET HIM,0
"Such a sweet guy. Class seems very difficult at first, but once you get the hang of it it's super easy. He grades solely on participation and completion of assignments. If you do what you're supposed to do, you will receive an A. You will spend each class discussing life, current events, history, etc. The class has no tests, quizzes, or final.",1
Awesome class he is very knowledgeable on the subject and willing to go out of his way to help.,1
She speaks too low,0
"Alicia is as good as it gets. A skilled, experienced, compassionate and humorous professor. However, SPAN 149 itself is hard. It's 8 months of material packed into an 8 week summer course. If you're not a natural at languages, it's a LOT of info, with little time to absorb it all. Alicia made it fun and worth it, but even she couldn't make it easy.",1
This Professor is absolutely amazing! The textbook he picked for the class is a good read!,1
"I learned a lot in his class. He is very smart and you can ask him about anything. He goes off topic a lot but you sure do learn a lot from it! Overall, I enjoyed his class. Worth taking.",1
"This class was pretty difficult. He goes pretty fast through a lot of material. I recommend recording his lectures. Tests are very hard!! They consist of true/false, short answer, and 2 essays questions. There are also 2 research papers and a debate.",1
"This hybrid HISTGLBT class on Dissident Sexualities was incredibly interesting. KM provided interesting lectures, but most of the semester was driven by student discussion. There was only one novel required for the class, but more than 600 pages of various journals and articles to read for the class, which can be tough on the CLA printing budget. ",1
"I was previously obsessed with Anthropology and took this class as a refresher. Unfortunately, Sullivan caused me to stray away from it from further on. Although he is a charming and interesting person, he is an extremely disorganized professor. Very unclear. Very off-topic. I would not recommend him as a teacher. Chat with him for fun",0
He's a really good teacher. Lectures are fun and time goes by fast in the class. Would recommend.,1
"Engaging lecture !! Helpful lecture note and review session. However, lecture was heavy, be ready to learn.",1
This semester I took Digital Image Editing and Digital Photography classes with Clover  Leary. I learned a lot from her class. She is a very clear instructor. She's inspirational and very intelligent. I'm gonna miss her a lot.,1
She's rude and whenever you ask questions she either ignores them or is rude about it. Doesn't tell you where her office is and doesn't explain anything when you ask for help. She yells and says that it's just her talking. She doesn't post when the test is until the day of the test.,0
"I would dare to say that this is the worst Writing Professor in NYU. She's vague, except when it comes to her ridiculous and tragically terrible prompts. Then when you don't write exactly she wants, she gives a bad grade and never gives any helpful criticism. There is absolutely no room to engage with your writing on more than a superficial level.",0
She's a great teacher. She is willing to go out her way to help you understand the notes. She loves when we ask her questions. She loves her history. ,1
"He is a great teacher. He has powerpoints available online for you to use. No quizzes or tests. The only work includes a journal, a group project, and daily discussion boards. He is VERY good at communicating. He will always answer your questions that you ask him.",1
"Had her for the online econ course- lectures were really organized and assignments were all on sapling with 3 tries to get it right. The midterm was basically a longer Sapling assignment but was a little annoying we had to explain every answer, which took longer than the questions. It was really well done, considering it was an online course.",1
"I took the web course during Spring.  Tests are straight out of Powerpoints.  There will be group projects to do, which is odd, since it is a web course.  It is kind of a pre-accounting course.",1
"Any professor that states within the first few weeks of lecture that they don't care whether or not you pass or fail, should change careersfired. His lectures and examples are confusing. For lab, he leaves and you have to figure out the models on your own. The study guides he has are from 2012 & do not reflect the tests AT ALL. #takeanyoneelse ",0
"He is hard to understand during class, doesn't bother to change the size of the screen to see his code. (if you sit far back enough), It's not easy to follow his lecture, most students aren't even engaged during class time. I would avoid this professor if given a chance, however he is nice on giving back points if you ask",0
I DO NOT recommend her for Microbiology! She makes it very hard for no reason and expects you to just know everything. The lectures doesn't really help because it's pretty much the slides that are posted on bb. Exams are super hard! But she does curve at the end depending on the class average.,0
"Although she's a really nice person, I would never take her class again. Lectures are very boring and all over the place. If you miss more than 2 classes you can't take the exam except attendance doesn't even count towards your grade. Her assignments were unusual and guidelines were vague. Would not recommend.",0
Heard from a couple of classmates that she can be kinda rude. Tests are filled with trick questions but you often won't have enough time to catch them. It's only lectures and readings. Not the worst class but not engaging at all.,0
"He doesn't understand that this is class meant for non-science majors! He teaches it as if you need physics to succed in the world, every class there's a quiz and you have to read the textbook to do well on them but even then the textbook is hard to understand. Goes on tangents a lot and he will always keeps you until class has ended.",0
"Duba is an awesome guy.  If you ask a question, he will answer it...  for the most part.  He tries to teach you how to find answers for yourself rather than just giving it to you straight.  He wants you to learn, not just to regurgitate information for the final.",1
As long as you participate the class is easy. You need the textbook to answer packets but if you can find one for cheap you're set. All grades are papers and if you email them to her ahead of time she'll give you feedback so you get an A.,1
Farzin Irani is a great professor. We did our quizzes and case studies online on mindtap. The quizzes are based directly from the book so you cant go wrong. You will get an A if you put the time into the class. She knows a lot about psychology. ,1
"Wonderful professor, loves history and have a quirky fun personality.",1
"Very nice person, very poor teacher.  In some units he doesn't even write in the powerpoint he just explains them and makes you record them.  No extra credit or opportunities to raise your grade.  What you get is what you get.  Gave a generic study guide that he didn't even make and was only helpful for 2/4 tests.",0
"Don't like this class, feels like any passion for MIS has left me after I took 3202 and this one. Ryan is very lengthy with his explanation and the slides are usually confusing and hard to comprehend. He teaches with a very high level mindset so that'd be useful more for IT consulting. Did learn from the cases but didn't enjoy his teaching.",0
Great guy helped me with my resume and interviewing skills.    Everyone should take him,1
"I loved epidemiology and have decided to go to get my PhD in this field. No textbook exams--awesome! But, you will read and write a lot, a good thing because he grades grammar. This means you will be a better writer at the end. Ah, I was so hoping to take his section of MBioS494 in spring, but he won't be teaching. Sad. He's super as a professor.",1
"Before taking philosophy of science, I read horrible reviews about Dr. Bazil. Attendance is mandatory, but he truly does the most he can to make sure you know the material before writing a paper on it. 2 exams- mid term and final. Majority of grades come from online quizzes, video modules and papers. Come to class and apply yourself easy A.",1
"A nice guy, very smart. Too smart to be teaching a class with no specific pre-req's. Bergstrom & Zandberg are passionate about this topic. But with no background, you WILL STRUGGLE. Lacking in rubrics. Group presenting, research paper, quizzes are messy. His slides lack text, so if you aren't present for the lecture, bad news.",0
"Classes were alright for the most part. However, she expects too much work out of students, especially for pretty unclear, uninteresting ""projects"" in class. You won't know your grade until you get it. ",0
"She is very rude. This class is boring and she doesn't answer questions when you ask. She gives smart remarks.  The work is not hard but she treats everyone like they are 17 and I am not.  If you can handle a rude teacher, the work is fine. Pointless though.",0
"Terrible professor. Wants students to communicate with him, when you do, if you are incorrect or reflecting a difference of opinion, you are berated in front of the class. Goes off on irrelevant tangents for lengths at a time and then complains that the class is so far behind. His study guide is in his own verbiage so it is difficult to research",0
"Best accounting professor ever!!! The material is not as hard as accounting one but you review it for like half of the semester. He makes the material easy to understand, over all best professor ever!!!",1
Pretty unorganized lecture. He doesnt listen much. I did not like his style of teaching very much either. I usually enjoy taking classes but not his...I wish I had taken another professor.,0
Really good teacher and person. Willing to work with you outside of class and offers advice consistently. Only issue I have is that he goes slow compared to the other 126 profs.,1
"He says class in mandatory but it isn't. Class lectures are boring as hell, if you can keep awake, kudos to you. There are 3  tests, 16 quizzes, and no final. And tests are composed of quiz questions and powerpoint information. There is a book you need to get but you'll find it worthless.",1
"Matt is probably the best part of PSY230. You get to work on your homework in class and if you don't understand the problem, Matt will come and help you until you figure it out. I wish he taught the lecture because I probably would have learned the material better if he was the one who taught it. Also, go to his exam reviews, it will really help",1
"Good lecturer with field activities. Seems like a nice guy but his tests are deceivingly tricky. Overlaps well with book; some assigned readings. B is very doable, A is hard to get.",1
"Not good. I would understand everything and be able to do the in class problems, but then would get to the test and the problems would be nothing like what we did in class. The test material was always unexpected no matter how much I prepared for the exams.",0
She is amazing. Extremely helpful and she makes her lecture fun. Strongly recommended!!,1
"Tough class, not many people expect Biology 160 to be so in depth.  Definitely have to put in A LOT of studying time.  Wouldn't recommend taking a lot of credits along with this class if you want to get an A.  She definitely knows her stuff, however, sometimes myself and other students felt that she forgets we are brand new to the subject.",1
"i have no idea how she got her Phd. her way of teaching is just stupid. i was planning to get at least a B in IE 314 class. but after the final test i was hoping for a D :( . She thinks she is strict, but in reality she is not. she doesnt know how to be flexiable with students. you will understand me if you try other professors in the department.",0
"Tells you the first day that you should quit your job or drop all of your other classes and just have his for the semester! He expects your to study minimum 2-3 hours a day. If you're 100% that you'll be in the medical field, then take it. A lot of people dropped his class within the first week. He made me feel like a dumb college student.",0
"Loved Miss Lytle, she made public speaking less painful!!!",1
"Online class, she did a horrible job at teaching the material and when asked for guidance she tells students try not to overthink it or read the book again instead of helping you understand. DO NOT TAKE HER. She also made us write a 10-12 page paper and it ended up being only a completion grade.",0
"This was the WORST college professor I have had in my life. I have been in school for years. I am currently going back to further my education. He made sexiest jokes (that weren't even funny), not allowed to drink water, can't wear a hat (not even in the winter), if he sees your phone, he will take your final grade down by one whole letter grade.",0
very difficult for a 100 level class..he tells you too much material to study for the tests so its hard to know what to focus on..he says test will be on chapters 1 to 5 but then there is only 7 short essay/questions on the test..he also does not care about his students succeeding or not..if all you need it for is a gen ed..go somewhere else,0
"OH MY GOD!! Stay away from this professor!  I am in her class right now and I have to drop it.  The course average for EVERY student in my online class is below a 40%.  I spent 6 hours on one of her ""basic"" homework assignments, and had a friend with a MASTERS DEGREE in computer sciences help me with this homework, and still got a 65%. SHES UNCLEAR",0
"BEST TEACHER EVER! This is a difficult class that involves TONS of memorization, but he uses notes handouts for study tools and everything comes straight off of the notes. He's funny, easy to get along with, and knows a lot! It's hard, but definitely worth taking!",1
"I despise math, and I have always hated it. This class ended up being my favorite of the semester! Prof. Dodson is really nice, and her lectures were easy to follow. She gives plenty of opportunities to ask questions. There were bi-weekly discussion boards, but they were pretty easy. HW was on MyMathLab, and it was an easy software to use. 10/10!!",1
Easy class for the most part. There are a lot of group projects. Somehow there are no presentations which doesnt make any sense because this a speech class. Teacher is a bit awkward but he is nice.,0
"He is loud and he talks very fast and not clear at all, he can be very theatrical or wimsical when explaining things which can make it fun at times. He never remembers his students, it was an easy A for me though.",0
"She is a very critical grader (basically an online bully) with homework submissions, if you want any feedback without a bad grade attached you have to see her outside of class. The class doesn't offer any practical opportunity to assess your level of understanding until the tests and projects which comprise of the majority of your grade.",1
"Avoid this professor. Bad in every way. Rude, arrogant, hard to reach, and disorganized.",0
"Professor Farhat is a tough teacher, but totally fair! I enjoyed the class a lot. The work is hard and there is plenty of it so you have to keep up and allow yourself enough time to do it. I liked her class because she made it interesting and easy to follow along, so the work was doable. I would totally take her again.",1
"Mr. Brooks was not my favorite, he was very monotoned so when you are in class it is very hard to stay focused. When working from home/online he is very short and not helpful in the slightest. Once working from home he would assign tests but not announce to you that you had an assignment. they were hidden in folders and not made known to students.",0
"Great teacher! His lectures are like stories-interesting.You will write the entire class period,so be prepared for your hands to hurt. Make sure you write down everything he says. His tests consist of a little bit of everything in the notes, so study all of it. As long as you attend class, pay attention, and take notes you will definetly pass.",1
"I have taken two classes with Ambassador Hare during my studies at BU. He is by far my favorite professor at BU. Although he assigns a substantial amount of reading, they are relevant and interesting. Highly recommend any class with him.",1
She is nice and will do makeups but she has got to be the worst math teacher ever. She doesn't even know half of the stuff she teaches and she doesn't know how to speak English but when you talk to her in Spanish she gets bothered.,0
"Classes were kind of boring, but she is a good teacher. Liberal.",1
"Really nice personality; not so good teaching skills. He will pretty much just show you what the textbook says but won't explain it. However, he will help you during lab time if you have any questions. Tests are really hard and you NEED to know the material fully if not you won't pass them. Take him if you can learn on your own.",1
"Her classes were interesting, but she grades so hard. She hardly ever gives full credit for anything. I would never take this professor again. She is very strange. I ended up with an 89.5 and she would not round me up to an A.",0
Worst class I have ever taken. I would not take another class from him in my life. ,0
"One of the better teachers I've had in college.  Very entertaining, and gets you interested in learning the subject.  Pretty nice, funny, and makes you feel comfortable to ask questions, and for help.  I'd take him again if I could.",1
No interest in teaching and not accessible to students . His exam questions will be having no relation to his lecture or practice exams.,0
Bogdan was great his class was straight forward you learn alot of vocab. Yet this test try to trick you but  if you read it twice you'll get it,1
"Funny professor makes class interesting.  If you attend and do the online hw, theres no reason not to get a A.  Recommend taking the class",1
"Professor William reminds me of a second grade teacher, while she is extremely upbeat and always has energy, her lecture do not help to understand what she is teaching. Most of the time you are teaching yourself.",0
Plant Evolution and Diversity. I have nothing good to say about this class or the professor. Grading is almost arbitrary. Impossible to get full credit on ANYTHING besides online quizzes unless he loses your assignment. Took points off a lab I completed for not having a parallel line pointing to 1 plant structure. This class will test your resolve.,0
"There is not enough words to describe Prof. Hasheminia. If you in love with Maths and Statistics, you will definitely enjoy his lectures. He makes the most comprehensive topics so easy to understand! He made the whole class to laugh at every lecture. But you also need to work hard in order to get a good grade. tips: read a book and do the homework!",1
Tough Grader. I feel like she doesn't give out A's at all in this class.,0
"He really knows his stuff and his lectures are very clear. He assigns classwork that really helps prepare you for the tests. If you don't understand something, don't be afraid to ask him for help. He's very approachable and willing to help. For whatever reason, his teaching methods really clicked with me. I highly recommend his classes.",1
"Dr. Phil Schertzing is a great professor. He provides feedback, guidance and insight and feedback on assignment.",1
"If you put effort into the assignments and read all the material, you will do well in Prof. Lawrence's classes. Since I took an online class I didn't have much interaction with him, but his comments were always helpful. In general, it's frustrating that BYU makes contacting your prof directly virtually impossible, but that's the school's fault.",1
"taking notes for his recorded lectures were hard for me because he covers a lot, so attending in-person was a must for me. Plus, I liked going to his lectures because it's always a good time. Exams are straight memorization from the lectures because it's multiple choice. Great and easygoing guy. If you're going to take PSY 101, take him!",1
Professor Wenstrom is a hard grader on written homework and unit exams when it comes to finals she changes the point value for each question but I struggle in her class with understanding the problem being asked on written homework and unit exams so I have to work with a tutor to help me fully comprehend the directions on homework assignments.,1
Thornton is overrated as a professor and other professors like Pattis are way better. His projects take way too much time and when I went to his office hours he kept being rude to people who asked him questions. Such temperamental people should not be teaching.,0
"She was horrible, she treated and 1101 class like a grad class..she doesnt care about anyone and will willfully fail the entire class.",0
"He's ok. He cares about people participating to an annoying extent. If he learns your name, he's going to call on you a lot. There are a lot of iclicker quizzes. He teaches the class well, but the homework can be frustratingly and disproportionately more difficult than the examples provided in class. They're worth a large chunk of your grade.",1
"Professor Wallace was an incredible Physics teacher. I owe all success to his explanations in lecture, and his homework assigned are like the tests, which allows you to prepare. If you do the assignments and take good notes, you will do well in this class!",1
"Don't believe the hype. He turned out to be pretty average. Left-winged, Dependence Theory; same things you would hear in other classes. Lectures consist of him reading off slides 90% of the time. He tries to get input from the class, but the same 4 opinionated people, more than likely naive Freshman, dominate discussion. VERY DISAPPOINTING",0
"If you know how to write a paper then you will do very well in this course because its not college level material. A month into the course we learned what a topic sentence and what a thesis statement were for a whole week. She also says ""pacific"" instead of ""specific"" which makes me not take her opinion on how to use the English language seriously.",0
"Prof Elliott offers a ton of EC and allows you to redo papers if you don't like your grade. She's boring as hell sometimes, but such a chiller. Also, she lives off of Diet Coke and Jane Austen novels. So that's something.",1
"At first it can be really boring because he has a monotone voice, but he's easy to understand. He would work through the material in class for the online homework and explain it in the simplest forms.",1
"Such a boring Professor. He is a nice guy, yet he is VERY monotoned. Also when he is going over the PowerPoints, he doesn't elaborate at all. I could not tell you a single that that we are talking about in this class. Tests and homework are easy though and the book is expensive.",0
"I only had him for lab but I plan to take him for lecture next semester, he is super helpful with the labs and is very clear in explaining instructions.",1
"Dr. Saunders is my favorite professor at UT. Apparently, the other professor is easier and does the HW in class. You'll actually learn something in here. His tests are moderately difficult, you'll pass if you did the homework. On the first day, he says attendance isn't mandatory, I wouldn't suggest not going.",1
"Gives an outline each class with underlined terms. On the exam, there will be an essay (100 pts) and 8 ID's  (underlined terms from outlines) & you need to choose 4/8 to elaborate on (100 pts) These 8 ID's could be any of the 40-50 terms from the outlines. Miss notes? you won't have enough info on ID's. Doesnt give any clues which ID's are on exam.",0
"I have taken 4 classes with this guy so far and let me tell you---it is easier than middle school.  He practicall gives grades away--no work at all is involved.  In fact , you don't even have to attend and will still get an A",1
"She makes this class really hard, but if you ask for help outside of class it will help. She moves too quickly through material, her accent makes her hard to understand, and she doesn't answer questions in class well. There are graded clicker questions each class. There is a semester long group project. Definitely suggest going to office hours.",0
"His a good teacher. He grades test very fast. Test are not too hard, but it'z smart to study some.",1
"He is very, very intelligent and adores french. However, he is rude, makes very inappropriate comments, and treats you as though you are inferior. If you can put up with all of this and go to class, you will learn a lot. (just remember that's a lot easier said then done)",1
"I took Prof Baileys ENG-205 to complete my transfer credit that includes English with the Critical Thinking. I took her summer course and it inlcudes lots of TEDtalks, Essays, Maintain a Journal that analyzes a Novel. With all the work she assigns, she is a fair grader and gives good feedback. I would take her again.",1
"I had Dr. Daniels for my creative nonfiction class, he was really nice then. However, for this fiction class, his comments on student's work were unnecessarily mean on paper. This fostered a non-creative environment where students felt overjudged. Definitely has a complex about ""high fiction"" just because he's published. He was definitely rude.",0
"She is a really nice teacher. You can tell she knows the material, but she is not always cocky or confident like many professors. As long as you show you care, and make an effort in class and discussions, it's easy to pull off an A.",1
Had Michaels for MCHT 111 ad MCHT 213.  Hands down best professor on campus.  Signed up for his MET210 course and got royally screwed as Evans is teaching it.  WHY ISN'T MICHAELS TEACHING MET210 AND ALL ENGINEERING COURSES FOR THAT MATTER???,1
Extremly boring class. She is very unorganized. Tough Grader. Missed class quite a few times.,0
"Professor Malone was pretty organized and helped make this class pleasant. He lets us drop one test and five quizzes at the end of the semester, this helped my grade a lot. It is pretty difficult to fail this class if you do what he asks. Homework is optional and he lets us retake quizzes as many times as we want. Highly recommend I loved his class",1
"Sometimes we make opinions about people based on their personality.  No doubt he has a great personality, in front of a group ""when he's on""  But, there is another side.  Personality does not mean great teacher",0
"I did online class, and although most others who took it struggled, I found it to be a breeze. If you just read the textbook and do the tests youll be fine. Theres a lot of work, but you just have to apply yourself and youll be fine.",1
"People like Fulsom for Astronomy, but I really enjoyed Nelson's class. I admittedly fell asleep often in the dark room during long lectures, but the subject matter is really interesting. Has experience in field. Very passionate about astronomy, clear about what will be on tests, good review sessions. I learned a lot.",1
Tests are easy and they are done as a group he also give tons of extra credit,1
"Sigh, so over this class. Her teaching method is hard to follow. She gets off of subject more than once each class period. You basically have to teach yourself. Be prepared to work if you take her class.",0
Never hated a professor until I met this guy. Honestly still not even sure if it was chemistry that he was trying to teach us. If I could give him a negative rating I would or at least a 0. Not enough thumbs to put down for him,0
I hate every day of it.,0
Professor R always answers e-mails promptly and provides helpful suggestions. Anyone claiming otherwise should quote from his e-mails so the allegations can be verified. I would bet that they won't do that since they stand on very thin ice.,1
"Tests are very easy; questions are all straight from the book. It's true that she doesn't allow make ups for missed exams, but she gives you all due dates up front Mark your calendar and you won't have any problems with her. She's also a very nice lady!",1
What did she even say? With her accent an fast talking I wasn't able to understand much of what she said. Her way of answering questions is by avoiding them. The online Labs Plus was more help than she was. ,0
"He is my favorite math professor. He stops if there is a question, it makes covering the material go a little slower but is well worth it to help everyone understand the material. He offers his lecture notes online so you can print them out and write on them in class, this was VERY helpful to me.",1
"Absolutely terrible. Gives little help on the massive amount of daily homework. Little explanation over topics expected to know without prior discussion. When he does answer a question is extremely condescending. On more than one occasion said ""If you don't understand this then drop the class."" Has knowledge of Spanish but doesn't wish to share it.",0
This class is extremely boring. The material is so dry and she does not make it interesting at allThe grading criteria is non existent and the midterm was 5 short answer questions worth 30%. The day of the midterm she held a review the first half of class? Wouldn't it be typical to have a review prior to midterm in order to study relevant material?,0
"An interesting guy. You basically do nothing in class. I took the service learning class and everything was done online. I'm not sure if it's like that for his other classes. He's nice, but cancelled class 4 times. Basically don't even worry about showing up to class more than a few times. You'll just watch movies that have nothing to do w English.",1
"Had him for computer programming classes, database, and combinatorics. Really nice and always willing to help. Tests aren't hard",1
"Great professor, couldn't ask for a better one.  Experienced and educated in subject matter that is taught. General interest in the opinion of students and willingly to discuss things in detail for his own and the class' benefit. Overall, 10/10.",1
"Her online class isn't even a class. It's terrible. She waits a month to grade essays and when she does, she gives no feedback. How in the world are we suppose to know what mistakes we make, if she doesn't point them out? She's not teaching. She just grades papers late with no feedback. She must enjoy killing our honors gpa.",0
"He is very opinionated, unorganized and annoying at times. But he seems to know his stuff. I took the class in the summer and its very difficult. He skips sections and veers off on other topics that have nothing to do with the course.. If you want to pass you have to read the book; the entire book. Front to back. Cover to cover.",0
The worst teacher i have studied with. His grading is ridiculous even the lecture is so easy (since it is a basic class). I would never take his class again,0
"Saas is a real gem, always make corny jokes throughout the semester. Show up to class, if no excuse then 10 deduction. Just do what is asked, meet his requirements for speeches and turn things in on time, then you'll end up with an A+. Super chill and laid back. (PS. NO MIDTERM/FINAL)",1
Decent lecturer but completely oblivious and soulless to the fact that it is a virtual format during COVID. Math is a beautiful subject and the Math department at UVU is comprised of soulless math machines who want you to shut up and calculate. Math education remains poor even at the university level. Hope you know how to teach yourself well.,0
"Great guy overall, knows that you're paying for your education and actually teaches you if you pay attention. Always a fun class never a dull moment.",1
Tough grader when it comes to papers and exams. Not as strict as the other reviews say(maybe cause I have/had him as an adjunct prof). Has chapter outlines that are easy to follow and everything covered will be on the quizzes(15 questions). Gives quizzes back for exam reviews. Response questions on exams are from writing assignment prompts.,0
"She is a very knowledgeable instructor. She often gets off task and talks about something else. If you do your work, she will help you. If you sit there and do nothing and ask for help, she will do the same back to you and will not help you.",1
"This teacher is a ray of hope for education in this country. He's not like the majority of the educators who only come in for a paycheck. He is there to teach you a subject, not have you pass a test, and he does a great job doing so. I failed my first applied calculus class, and knew nothing go in, Passed his with a B+ Great teacher",1
pretty hard class if you don't study the powerpoint. Must do the homework and its due every week. Gets into world news a lot instead of actually talking about the subject. No extra credit and mandatory attendance. only 3 tests as well.,0
"Read and ""Practice"" what he gives. Don't study text book. His sample papers will be easy but exam will be really tough and confusing. No assignments. No attendence.  Russian accent. Only problems even though he gives theoretical questions in sample paper. RTT is a must read topic.",0
"I'd heard of life-changing classes, but this one truly fits the description. I am able to apply ideas/techniques learned in this class to improve my daily life. Fr. Paul's interesting and easygoing lecture/teaching style added to vigorous classroom discussion, good visual/video aids, and challenging assignments makes this a great class!",1
"Worst professor I have ever taken, he Doesn't stay on topic instead goes on random rants that have nothing to do with the subject were talking about, can't teach his materials, and knows nothing about religion what so ever. you would be wasting your money worth on this professor.",0
She says herself that she makes this class easier than other teachers do. The only homework there is is taking notes from the book and three papers throughout the semester. Easy A,1
"Exams tricky, not as easy as others say. Some extra credit but don't count on it to save you",0
Professor is flat affect and makes you feel incompetent when you ask a question. During reviews she is very vague and doesn't give good instructions on where to focus your energies to prepare for a test. When you are in lecture she seems very unsure of herself and uses a lot of filler words.  She also takes a really long time to grade your tests!,0
"Dr. F is has high expectations for his students, and has no problem asking you if he should fail you come final presentation time. Put in the hours to avoid this at all costs. His lectures are great, and he is usually quite witty. If you're going to fall asleep in his class, probably best to just not go.",1
"Amber doesn't care about you., don't go in thinking she does. She likes maybe 3 students and HATES another 3. Just pray you aren't one she hates. Cause she doesn't even try to pretend.",0
"Do not take this class until you have taken physics! That's all it is! The people who were lost were the ones who never took it. 3 exams with an optional final. Exams were HEAVILY curved. She wasn't too bad, but didn't seem sure of herself. Study old exams, read, and visit office hours and you'll be OK.",0
"Good prof, very smart. Prolly one of the best i've had in uni",1
Always punctual and expects you to be. Good examples and gives fun facts now and then. Very informative and willing to help with difficulties. Learns your name and gives individual attention after class if needed. No homework (lab gives hw). Ensures all topics are covered and follows strict guide. Doesn't care about attendance.,1
Never responds to emails. You can miss one or two classes in the beginning. But do not miss in the end that's when the big assignments are. The final and the midterm are fun. you get to design them yourselves. If you miss too much class she is not very helpful and does not care whether or not you pass.,0
"Very nice professor, difficult lecture to understand, however, he makes it easier. Take home tests, multiple attempts and untimed.",1
Love his class.,1
She is such a nice person! she will help you understand the class especially is you are a freshman and do not how to college.,1
This Professor was probably one of the most confusing and hard to read professors I have endured. She teaches a four hour class that can easily be taught in an hour and fifteen minutes. Only use her if there is no other open class.,0
haha... professor Panek. The guy is really strange but very nice. Very good professor... will walk you through the labs and answer any questions you have. Oh and sit in front because he writes low on the board,1
"DO NOT TAKE CLASS WITH HIM! Can't understand him, and makes you feel bad for asking questions. Homework takes hours and is extremely hard. I wasted money and withdrew cause I couldn't stand it anymore.",0
"This class literally preaches ""whiteness"" as the number one factor influencing everything in society.  If you claim that you are not racist you may actually receive points off.  Never bother reading the book but definitely purchase it, 9/10 answers for the quizzes can be found with the glossary or a simple google search.  Easy A but NOT worth it.",0
One of the worst teachers I've ever had. ,0
"Super hard to get help on anything. When I reached out for help because I was confused, she ignored the request. She makes you do all the work when there is a technical issue.",0
1. He does not understand a thing about what he's teaching;    2. He does not understand your codes either;    3. Constantly asks for help from the student next to him and 'his old friend'--google;    4. Takes points off for no reason he could explain;    5. Read directly from class notes he posts;    6. Can't prepare you ready for anything.,0
Gives a daily quiz almost every class which is one question that she basically gives you the answer for. Only grades the first 15 so anything after that is extra credit. Assigns few out of class assignments and those are extra credit. Essentially come to class and pay attention and you'll pass with flying colors. Does grade participation points. ,1
You use the textbook a lot! Teacher does not put in as much effort as the students. Teacher uses the excuse of forgetting to grade assignments or is busy. The syllabus is outdated along with written assignment requirements. It is the last week of the semester and this class is still waiting for feedback on their final assignment.,0
"DO NOT take this class if you expect to learn anything. I took A&P 1 with him...Very good class if this is a repeat for u and u only need the credit. self taught students should b fine. Dont email or call him, he wont answer. He will lower ur grade for missing classes, study and memorize ur practice tests and u will ace this class.",0
"Best teacher I've had at the JC. Super funny, and very helpful. I genuinely enjoyed taking his class.  ",1
"Sp 20 Honestly speaks in Spanish the whole time, youll be lost, and shes got a lot of attitude when she emails you. Stay clear",0
Gives good feedback and inspiring,1
This class was so war...it really do get u ready for the industry...chef lacastra that man is so cold...tha dude made rice pilaf in 5min....,1
"Unclear criteria in exams. Teaches his own developed tool that doesn't work half of the time and expects you to peform like you are a 10 years experienced developer. Just like any other professor, he is just sweet on the top but will not give you any marks. SKIP SKIP SKIP.",0
"Very rude and unhelpful via email, though I suppose that is because it is an online class and she does not want to be bothered with helping students. I sincerely hope that she isn't this unapproachable and rude to all of her classes.",0
"Loved the course and the instructor. Eight assignments, but all very relevant and helpful both for the grade and for personal info.",1
I loved Professor Henry-he was great! I would take another class with him given the chance. He gave clear direction and was extremely helpful. He doesn't move on unless the students understand what he has taught thus far.,1
"I get A's on every paper I write.  Dr. Lewan  gave me my first B and I hated her for it.  She ended up being the best professor I had at ACC  because she cared about me enough to make me a better writer.  She does grade tough but if you love to write, take this course and you won't regret it!  I have the utmost respect for her and love her sarcasm",1
Great lecturer and promoter of discussion. She is a tough but fair grader with plenty of constructive criticism. Would recommend!,1
The best of the best Mathematics prof. Enough said.,1
"A perfectly decent professor, but the same can't be said of her as a human being. Spent an introduction to Criminal Procedure berating an entire class for their uniformly poor performance on the Criminal Law exam rather than placing the blame on herself as the testmaker and arbitrary grader.",1
"Chemistry is already a hard class itself, then you add a professor that is unclear with each content. It's hard to understand him, He's very smart, but his smartness does not translate to  a teacher than can make the students understand the content. Overall I was disappointed with the chemistry class, and I don't recommend him for a 209.",0
"The class is super manageable. If you don't understand a concept or a HW question she is super helpful in office hours, or will respond super quickly to emails. Exams are really fair and the lowest grade drops. The lowest HW grade also drops. The online HW is a bit of a drag but it really helps with exam prep- the exams are easier than the HW.",1
"Tells interesting stories to make the class more engaging. She has a lot of experience in special education and loves what she does. Extremely knowledgeable about content. You do need a textbook. Cancels class a lot, which is great. Pick a good group of peers to sit with early on because group work is heavy. Groups are set once picked.",1
"Never take it, unless you have really smart friends to get answer from them. He is boring, not easy at all, you have to write well for every tests, and TA s are  hard grader, they grade hard for this class.",0
"She is a very nice lady, but I would NEVER take her again! Totally disorganized and barely teaches! I was excited to take this class & learn some new skills, but instead I wasted a whole bunch of money & time on nothing. She would come in, take attendance, tell you to look at the posted assignments & then leave her student assistant to do it all.",0
"Prof. West is an awesome teacher! I didn't know what to expect when I took this course as a math alternative, I'm glad I did! The shock factor is there, don't be surprised. His teaching compels you to want to do your homework. I would recommend this Instructor. So much covered in each session, don't miss a class.",1
"These German classes have been structured better than any other foreign language classes I've taken. Each night after class you have homework, but it's easy and really helps you grow your knowledge of the language. The grades for all of the assignments are fairly divided, the in person lectures are great, and the textbook is easy to understand.",1
I am in utter shock and dismay after the horrific events that occurred from January-March 2019. This class was absolutely horrendous. Where do I even start? She gives TONS of homework every single week. She even assigns it right after TESTS! Her tests are always the MAXIMUM level of difficulty. Please please please avoid this class if youwanttoLIVE,0
"Clearly Explains all the readings in great detail, but overall is extremely dull in class. Not very good at grabbing students' attention and makes it difficult to stay focused for a long period of time. I definitely would not recommend taking this if it is the 1 hr 45 mins class- it is too long and difficult to sit through at one time.",1
"Great Professor, very smart guy! This is an ID course, Not an easy A and lots of work!  If you think Nanotechnology sounds cool, don't take this class.  If you are an engineering student or have taken chemistry or calculus you might enjoy this.  Very informative but not fun. I think the only bad grades are those who don't attend.?.?",1
"worst teacher ever, all the bad comments in here are all true. Tough grader, no consideration what so ever, no extra credit even if you beg for it, and if you miss something she won't let you retake it. I would say taking this teacher as a last resort but honestly don't take her at all. she loves to shove the syllabus in your face.",0
"PROS: EVERYTHING is on canvas, so you never have to guess what will be on the tests. He is really lenient when he grades the test and lab practicals. He gives you extra credit opportunities. Questions are welcomed. CONS: This summer course is a 4 hour class MTWR, his accent was a little hard to understand. The class requires a lot out of you.",1
"I took Geography 1 online and he made it very easy to pass his class! All you need to do is participate in the discussion questions and do the weekly assignments. He gives you a study guide before the tests, just complete them and literally all of the questions are on the test. Super easy class if you are looking for science class for your GE.",1
"This class was a lot of work and was quite disorganized, so it was hard to know what was going on at any given point in time. Nothing was graded too harshly, but I never felt like I got helpful feedback. If you work hard, you will pass the class, but I don't feel like I actually learned as much as I was hoping to.",0
"His quizzes come directly from the homework (which is optional) and the tests are composed of a bank of questions he provides. (With the numbers changed of course). So if you put the time into his class you can get an A for sure. However, his lectures were boring and largely based on theory instead of how to solve it. ",1
"If she says shes doing the flipped approach get out now, this class was horrible. She did not teach us anything we had to read the chapters and it was like reading spanish. Gave us a quiz BEFORE we had time to ask any queations. All around terrible class",0
"Took during winter intersession and it was pretty easy. Two case studies, two midterms, and one final. All of it is easy as you can easily skim through the book for nktes and answers. Exams were given a two hour limit and had 20 questions each. Professor Shan is helpful since she reminds the class deadlines.",1
STAY AWAY! The school may as well throw a statistics book at you and expect you to learn math by reading the book because thats what he does. He refuses to help students even when i asked for help finding a tutor he said he knew of none,0
"Great instructor, very knowledgeable and cares about his students. Acts tough but is really a softy if you get to know him. The Law & Security program was challenging, have to put the work in and show up for class this is defiantly not one of those programs where you just show up and not bother doing the readings or studying and pass.",1
I graduate from this program in 2014 and just had to come back to mention that 3 years later and I still resent this man and his attempt at teaching.,0
"I have taken his History 2 class and loved it! That's why I'm back for more I guess? The essays are a bit much, but he doesn't give any tests so I guess it makes up for it. I like the most is the stories he tells about history, makes me see historical figures in a different light. Not sure about others but I loved his class! Recommend",1
"Pete is a fantastic teacher. I took his class that had to switch to online, and he made sure to work with all of us and ensure we understood everything and were doing as well as we possibly could. Super cool professor. If you need a math class, I'd highly recommend him.",1
He loves to curse which is not good if you dont like curse words. Get ready to talk he will make you. Turn in your papers he will tell you if you have them in front of the class but wont read them unless you got a perfect score on a assignment later on in the course. He sometimes speaks some words that shouldnt be said. And reads mc papers.,1
"Gave papers made classmates revise or else itll hurt your grade.. didnt have class the last two months, still had essays due tho!",0
"You have to be a certain type of personality to both enjoy Nelson's teaching style and to connect with/appreciate him as an individual. He totally intimidated me for the first month, but I came out of his class feeling very glad that I took on the challenge. If you won't be willing to refine your writing style and skills, do not take his class.",1
"One of the worst teachers I've ever had. He is rude, condescending, and a complete nightmare to have to deal with. Has impossible standards. Doesn't like to answer questions. Talks down to anyone who dares question him. The material in and of itself is not so difficult, but his presentation of it makes it incomprehensible. Don't take him if you can",0
"This is the first class from FSCJ That was boring. The assignments were uninteresting and so I didnt bother to complete some assignments and I prefer to take the C. There were 3 writing assignments, 5 discussions, 1 team marketing plan, and 8 quizzes. The professor was MIA for most of the class and graded all assignments after the class was over.",0
She gives a test or quiz almost every single class period no matter if it's lab or lecture.  Quizes are normally 50+ questions and then she adds about 5-10 short answer questions on top of that.  Tests on the other hand are alot longer than that.  Info on tests/quizzes are not covered in lecture and her grading makes no sense.She is very confusing,0
"Unless you have a good previous understanding of chemistry, avoid her like the plague. Yeah, you might pass but if you learn anything its most likely because you taught yourself. Getting extra help is like pulling teeth and her lectures are absolutely brutal. Such a waste of money for this class and will probably have to retake at some point.",0
"Do not take this class whatever you do. This guy lies about due dates, does not fully explain assignments, and assigns reading as if his class is your only class. also, tons of films to watch as readings too. Lectures are unorganized and unhelpful. Worst class at MSU. Guaranteed.",0
His class is informative and interesting. He uses real-world experience and examples to help us understand what the book is trying to teach. Tests are open book as well.,1
Did not usually respond to emails or accommodate my disability. When he did respond to emails it was usually when I emailed him a second or third time. He also did not provide feedback on my requests for help on my assignments.,0
"! If you ask him a question most times he wont answer and will say well if you read your notes you would know. He also graded extremely hard, gave very difficult exams with over 70 multiple choice questions and short answers. No laptops or talking in class. If you disturb class in any way he will absolutely lose it.",0
DON'T TAKE HERE SHE WILL GIVE YOU A F FOR EVERYTHING DON'T HELP YOU AT ALL DON'T TAKE HER RUN NOW,0
She doesn't give feedback or let you see what you got wrong on quizzes. This is especially a problem because she has made mistakes grading. She gets annoyed when students ask questions. I basically taught myself using the online homework and book.,0
"He was a funny guy and kept things interesting.  He puts his notes online so you can follow them during lecture.  That being said, going to lecture is a good idea because sometimes he veers from his written notes.  I liked him.",1
"Absolutely hands down the worst professor I've ever had. Not helpful, not available during office hours, completely self involved. Pretentious, teaches theory entirely from one perspective. Also she can be rude and inappropriate. Essentially, she does not care about students, she is not interested in teaching, and she should not be a professor.",0
"Do ALL the suggested textbook problems! This is what allowed me to do good on the midterms and final. There are no surprises, he cares about the success of each of his students. Such a nice old man. Loved him dearly. I wished he taught the rest of the series.",1
He is super clear on what he expects.  He gives you lecture notes to follow and the quizzes are directly off the lecture notes. Didn't need to buy the book. As long as you study the lecture papers you'll do fine on the quizzes. If you get an A on all your quizzes you don't need to take the final.,1
He went off and got a new job at Google like 2/3 through the semester and dropped the ball on our class. Told us about a huge final project and then ended up assigning it like 3 days before it was due. It ended up being easier than anticipated but it was a stress fest. Was too busy to answer any questions via Slack so no one knew what was happening,0
Dr Jones is a great CHE professor! I dropped the course twice with other professors at this campus bc of a lack of clarity and talent but Dr Jones is the first to make me stick around and I'm thankful I did. She expects a lot and unfortunately doesn't have the office for lab hours but is willing to do what she can to help as long as you communicate,1
Cannot write and talk at the same time! Would only write directly in front of him so we couldn't see then once he was finished quickly talked about & went to something else. Tests were harder than lecture material. Anything was fair game so it was hard to study. Nice guy but definitely would not recommend as a professor,0
"I would only recommend you take his classes if you READ!  There is no need to go to class because he posts pp's & audio online.  Tests are 3/4 lecture material and 1/4 reading.  Again, only take his classes if you plan on reading.  Losing points for the reading questions will have a HUGE impact on your grade. There is easy extra credit.",1
"Sewell is more than useless when it comes to helping students. Instead of clarifying, he only adds confusion. He gives condescending responses to questions and is rarely available.",0
"Extremely difficult and expects alot from her students. Not much help when asking questions. Her mood determines how she would approach her students, and if she did not have a good day, it was placed on her students. Learned some stuff but never felt comfortable around her, felt as if always walking on eggshells.",0
"There's a lot of LONG power points. If you already have a basic knowledge of computer parts and how they work, some days will be boring. Lab days are the better part of class as everything is hands on. Requirements are a screwdriver, pliers and an antistatic wrist band for the class. Overall good teacher.",1
"Ms. Johansen is very nice, however, her class is too easy, and the examples she provides from her own clients are presented more like gossip than case studies.  She makes it a point to say that people are not ""crazy"", they just function at a ""different level"", but it's obvious that she believes her level of functioning is higher.",1
"I am usually an all A type of student, and I received a B- in this class. The papers she makes you write there is no feedback for and simply gives no points for certain sections often. An extremely hard grader. Exams are very difficult even if you read the textbook and study notes as I did still does not guaranteed you know the info needed.",0
"Dr. Gallo is a good professor for this class . It's 100% case studies so you're actually learning stuff that will be applicable in the business world. Class is tough; doing the reading and participating is a must everyday, but Dr. Gallo is definitely not as bad as older reviews here make it seem. If you put in the effort you can get an A.",1
"Great professor. Very nice to students who didn't get a high grade on tests. Lecture can be long but he tries to be engaged with the students to keep us awake, haha. However, I STRONGLY advise people who take his class to buy his recommended book, because like 70% of what we go over in the lectures and tests are based on the reading in the book.",1
She does not grade fairly. Very poor teaching skills. I would not take her class again. Most people dropped the course.,0
"The course was pretty easy. It is self taught. You are required to read the chapters and create the files. Anytime I saw someone ask question on the forum, he gave snide answers. My polite emails for help obtained one word answers. But, do the work, you get the A. This was 8wk summer a course (same amt material), still didn't take up too much time.",0
He's a good person. Everything you could ask for in a professor.,1
THE MOST AMAZING PROFESSOR IVE EVER TAKEN. YOUR MISSING OUT IF YOU DONT GET A CHANCE TO TAKE HIM,1
"She's such a great professor! Took her class this semester and I enjoyed every class session. She does lecture, and I suggest you listen and take notes, but the class got into so many great discussions, which really helped everyone to get to know each other. Great person, very easy class, not much homework, and really funny stories!! TAKE HER!!",1
"This class is pretty stupid for those who have to take it. But she is super easy. As long as you attempt the work, you'l get an A. And if you help with your group. If you have to take this class, take her. Youll get a A",1
She doesn't clearly explain the assignment and grades extremely harshly. My friend took the same course with another teacher and I have been helping her quite a bit. She has managed to ace the course. I have put in a lot of work into my assignments and her topics are extremely boring and there isn't much room for brainstorming.,0
"His assignments are not clear. He does not explain his grading, he simply assigns a number or in my case a letter grade with no explanation. He can be very slow to answer emails. He also has a lot of work that is outside of class interviews, community service, etc. that makes it very difficult for an online class.",0
Great Guy.  Grades are easy to come by.  Would do anything to help you out.,1
"Horrible professor. I wouldn't recommend her to anyone. She grades very hard on essay, and her intructions are confusing.This class was a waste of money.",0
"Mr. Lloyd is a very tough grader who unfortunately isn't very clear on assignments. He has no problem humiliating students by showing their papers to the class as an example of what no to do. He also pulls up previous students Facebook's to make fun of them.  If you want a teacher to be supportive or helpful, Lloyd isn't the guy.",0
This professor is awful. He only focuses on the logic aspect of seminar. He doesn't know how to teach. I suggest not taking his class unless you want a D.,0
I do not recommend this teacher at all. I took the online course and she is very bad at responding to emails in a timely manner. She does nothing to help the students and grades unfairly. People who do horrible on their speeches seem to get better grades than those who are actually good at public speaking. DO NOT TAKE HER if you want a good grade.,0
"LOVE LOVE LOVE HER! she is super nice, funny, responds to emails quickly. I don't have anything bad to say about her. I appreciate having her there as someone i look up to. She presents very clearly, connects with students if you make an effort, and has a wonderful personality",1
"Enjoyed his personality as a professor, very nice and caring. Class has no homework, but requires a LOT of studying. 4 non cumulative exams throughout the semester determine your grade because the only other grade put in are online quizzes which are easy. Basically, no opportunity for improvement after the exams so do well on all 4.",1
"I have her now and I want out. She's nasty with her students and gives a tremendous amount of ""busy work"". She then lectures you on the content you have already read.",0
"Hybrid class: Do online work & go to class, even if you feel you dont need to, GO TO CLAS -lectures are tough to understand -examples dont make since! -I would def. take into consideration before taking him if math is your weak spot. Hard to tell if he actually cares to see his students succeed! -Utilize tutors & study groups for sure!!",0
i was awful at the material in this class and handy made it easy to understand and works with you to help you figure it out. she is a sweetheart and even helps students she has no obligations to. you don't even have to have her for a class and she offers you help.,1
"Log into the lecture on time, TRY to pay attention to his lectures, and do the homework and you'll pass. He's very confusing when it comes to what expects. Be prepared for one day he wants you to just randomly download respondus lockdown for an exam WITH a webcam with no explanation. For technical issues, he wasn't good at assisting.",1
"He's a very passionate professor, you can tell he really loves Marketing, and get's everyone engaged. Here's my complaints, he is very unclear with the GRADING!! He grades assignments very late. I got 10 assignments back all at once so I was in the blue about what my grade was. The final exam was very rushed! Every absence past 2 is 1% your grade.",1
She was a very organized professor. Not too many lectures at all and encouraged you to think outside the box by putting what you learn into both papers and discussions. Nothing too excessive word-wise (between 300-500 words depending on the assignment) and no quizzes. She is a great professor!,1
"She's great. Class is easy and somewhat interesting. Honestly, you can skip class as long as you go online to do at least one of the Mastering Nutrition questions during the class.",1
"Dr. Mike is a great professor at U of M. He actually cares about hoe well students understand the material. He is one of the only physics professors that takes the time to review before exams. Although the exams are pretty hard, Dr. Mike takes the time to go over any questions students have.",1
"Dr. Bricker is the worse professor I've ever encountered. She has no respect for students, makes them feel dumb, and actually called our class of 120+ students ""stupid"" multiple times. She was the only teacher for this course, but if you can, DO NOT TAKE HER COURSE",0
"He has a hard time staying on task and I never knew what he was trying to explain. However, once you go along with the craziness, you might enjoy it. He is very easy going and easy to get along with, but understanding his ideas and assignments is another story..",0
She made me want to kill myself with a pitchfork to my eyes.,0
"This course can be very time consuming, but if you listen to the lectures and take notes you will do fine.",1
"Professor Yearwood is great, funny guy and loves to chat. By far one of the most helpful professors I have ever taken in MDC. If you want a good professor for CGS he's the one, really funny guy. Time will fly!",1
i took building construction with him online. its like he wasnt even there. he never talked to us about anything. we just did the assignments and got no feedback. this was my 1st online class and i never want to take another 1. i had no motivation to log on from my house and i was always late with everything. he gave everyone As onthe paper though.,0
"I took this class for credit and ended up just absolutely loving it. Melissa is a real treat, she's a very respectful instructor with the greatest feedback. We had two students who had been very shy at the beginning of the semester and ended up becoming some of the best speakers.",1
"3 texts required for the class (she assigns a ton of reading). Need main textbook for required papers. Canceled class multiple times an hour or less from the start of class. Attendance ""not mandatory"" but she gives pop quizzes. Never seemed to be prepared. She made up for most of her slacking with extra credit and study guides for exams.",0
"Honestly it was more the class teaching him. Hes pretty old and gets things confused. He does give you good tips and shows how things are done, but he says he gives points for setting up problems on tests and he doesnt. If you dont do great on a few things, scores make you fail.",0
"Its simple; If you are NOT GREAT at math find another professor. If you are Great at math this class will be great for you. Good Professor, just not helpful for those new to Stats.",0
"Great teacher, helps his students as much as possible, and if you put effort forth, it is not hard to receive an A.",1
"Mrs. Hahn herself is a quite nice person. Although in her lectures, her voice is so monotone and unenthusiastic, like she wants to just get it over with instead of actually teaching. The tests are incredibly hard no matter how much I study, I can never seem to get above a 40. Wouldn't recommend, and won't be taking this class with her again.",0
"Just like the other person said, do NOT expected full credit on anything. There are no tests or quizzes and don't bother buying the book, we never used it once. Her PowerPoints were interesting though. Overall, I wouldn't recommend her.",1
"Definitely not a professor that I would recommend. She is not very nice, and is extremely unorganized. Everything is online, even the book. She does not respond to emails often, and when she does she is very passive aggressive. She should not be a professor. I have not learned a thing from her class.",0
"She is very manipulative and plays the good intention card very well, but when it comes down to it, she is mainly concerned with getting people in honors college to meet her quota.  She puts her own personal goals before those of her students.  She also has the tendency to go to students professors with issues instead of the students themselves.",0
"Don is such a beauty. He is hilarious and made a late night lecture fun and exciting to attend, even online. He is a great prof and made a math-heavy class easy to understand for someone like me who is not a math person. He made me enjoy finance and inspired me to pursue more classes in finance/accounting for a career. 10/10",1
He was not really helpful at all. He never gave us graded assignments back on time. He was disorganized and did not follow his syllabus. He graded papers way too hard for no reason. I didn't learn really anything in his class.,0
"Seriously an amazing professor! Yes, he is very lecture heavy so be prepared to take notes, but he makes it interesting!! He makes jokes and relates history to now. I really wish I could take him again! As long as you attend class and take notes to study you are completely fine!",1
"Sarcastic and rude.  Does not care about her students and loves to kick people out of lab for any reason she can find.  Wrote up 25 students for academic dishonesty in one semester. Many of which claim was a false accusation and had to get appealed.  Doesn't grade anything on time, doesn't give good directions, and takes off points any chance given",0
"I thoroughly loved his class. He's funny and enjoys teaching. His lectures require a lot of notes which he doesn't post online so don't skip. The aerial project was time consuming so don't procrastinate, but it's a nice grade booster. His tests are easy if you pay attention and take notes, so if he draws something you should copy it.",1
difficult class and to be successful you have to do a lot of homework and additional tasks. The professor does his best to explain difficult topics so that it becomes clear. The more you practice the better the exam results.,1
He's a great teacher and tells you exactly whats going to be on the test. Lectures are tied in with the book and his real life experiences and encourages the class to discuss about the lecture. You must attend his classes to pass his test because he will pretty much tell you exactly whats going to be on the exam.,1
He assigns too much reading  which is too difficult anyway. Trys to talk to students on a high conceptual level when they haven't read the material.,0
"I enjoyed ""Mr. Jason"" a lot! He's a real funny teacher, and quite the sweetheart too. You'll do better if you already know how to draw realistic anatomy, but I do feel that I improved a lot. Very understanding of outside circumstances, but can be a little strict when it comes to deadlines.",1
"Avoid this teacher at all costs! Major language barrier,unorganized and sucks as a teacher. If he doesn't understand your question, he completely ignores you.",0
Sometimes rude to students. Not very understanding. Rushes through lectures. Doesn't always give students a change to speak in discussion.,0
"Great professor.This class was very lengthy and kinda boring, but he is very enthusiastic about acct.He goes above and beyond to help you pass even if you havent done anything.He is very funny and like one of the guys.",1
"Her class taught me so much about reading and understanding scientific literature and data analysis. She goes through research papers, asking students to interpret statistics and taking apart data in tables. It could be tediuos at times, but soooooo worth the effort if you want to learn how to read research papers. One of the best classes I've had.",1
"If you can switch classes, then do. If you cant find a tutor! His teaching style is so hard to follow that I have to teach myself all the stuff. We usually have to correct his mistakes at least once per class. One thing if you have him-Do the homework. Its not mandatory, but hell be more likely to give partial credit on tests if you do it.",0
Stay FAR FAR FAR AWAY from this teacher. He is awful. He is useless when it comes to getting help. On discussion posts he will give responses that don't go with what was asked. He puts questions on tests that were not learned during that unit. Like previously mentioned don't take him. Find someone who knows what they are doing. He is really bad.,0
"Assignments due every Sunday. The ppts were posted from the beginning to take notes and the textbook had so many resources to help practice. He was quick to respond to emails, sent many reminders, and helped me out a lot esp during covid-19. He's amazing & wants the best for every student and as long as you study you will get the grade you deserve.",1
"The reason I transferred.  Ruined my first year of law school, and I got absolutely nothing out of it.  Learned a lot about fetal death cases in Rhode Island, and that's about it.  Useless comments, contradictory advice.  I feel bad for Japan, she is going to set their legal system back 100 years.",0
"I typically enjoy English. Not with this professor. I took his class online, and it was the worst decision I could have ever made. His assignment descriptions are vague. When emailed with questions about assignments he does nothing more than restate what was already posted. He also had MANY grammatical errors in his comments on papers. Horrible.",0
"Dr. Ghosh is truly a great prof. She is caring, kind, & helpful. She is accessible by phone, email, Skype, & FaceTime. Her online course is very organized with clear instructions. You will have 1 on-campus exam, 12 quizzes, 4 reflections, 1 project, & extra credit. The book is required. Honestly, this class is an easy A.",1
"She is one of my favorite professors. Her class is interesting and well-structured. She provides you with grading rubrics and step by step directions on every assignment. You can always email her or meet her outside of class if you have questions. Do keep in mind, however, that your attendance and reading the textbook is going to be graded too.",1
"funny guy, confusing lectures, easy tests",1
Best teacher Ive had @ State.,1
"I agree with all the postings here.  On a related front, my room mate is a history major and the majors are NOT permitted to take her (I guess this is something of an unwritten rule).  Translation: she is not solid enough for majors, so the general population has to tolerate her.  Do NOT take her if you care about your education.",0
Very boring professor who seems to drag on lecture as everyone falls asleep. Does not seem to care about students or their situations and is not very helpful in person individually either. Would try to take another professor.,0
"Dont take this class if you want to understand statistics. Do take it if you dont care and just want an easy A. Lectures the entire time but never explains what any of the distributions or equations mean, and instead just gives you homework answers and tells you exactly what format exam questions are in which you can put on a cheat sheet.",0
Horrible professor. Dont take him. Very disrespectful and rude to students for no reason. Grades too hard and assigns difficult work.,0
"If you are not fluent in Spanish, you will struggle a lot. He depends on you to ask, and when you ask he might not explain it well. ",0
"terrible with teaching, not accessible outside of class, basically had to teach myself",0
Difficult class. She goes through chapters quickly. Makes herself available when needed.,1
"Avoid!!! Does not teach. Lectures are in a quiet monotone voice, and he reads off unoriginal slides. Sits in his chair for the remainder of the lab. You end up having to learn all the material yourself. Worst professor ever.",0
" very energetic women & makes class interesting, when it comes to grading (esp papers) extremely hard.  her hand writing is worse than a doctors. She will give feedback all over papers, but its illegible.  I went to office hours and she actually turned me away because she had 2 students coming at the same time. Makes EASY quest impossible to answer",0
"Great professor. Absolutely loved his course. Was an honors seminar, so a lot of reading and writing. Really understanding and caring professor who only wants you to learn and succeed in his class. Make sure to participate a lot!",1
"Super nice guy, but not super good at explaining things. Always does a vote before class for lecture or for problems... PICK PROBLEMS! All the tests are on actual problem solving and not generic concepts. Constantly practice them. Practice assignments greatly bring up your grade. They're weighted more than the tests I swear.",1
"You must go to class. She does not put the information on PowerPoints, she only gives verbal lectures so you have to pay attention and take notes fast. No textbook, only some online readings that you have to write responses to but it's easy. She gives a study guide before each exam, overall definitely recommend.",1
"Avoid if possible, unhelpful and beyond arrogant, very vague with everything in my opinion.",0
"The class is really easy, but you kind of have to teach yourself.  He is confusing in lecture and he even confuses himself most times.  If you ask for help on a question he either does it without much explanation, or he gets it wrong and another student has to complete it for him.  I think he is very smart, but isn't the best teacher.  ",0
"Super nice guy who is clearly passionate about Black studies because he grew up in the 60s. The grades are done with homework questions (which you need the book for, hands down) and a research paper. He gives study guides for exams. I was the only Caucasian male in the class but he made me feel right at home and got me invested in the subject.",1
She's very enthusiastic about teaching. She encourages everyone. She's very respectful and she's a great teacher. She thinks outside the box. She was different from most professors and that's what I liked about her.,1
I barely learned anything. The only reason I did well was from teaching myself and being taught by my friends. His class was useless because he just recites a lecture with no interaction and flies through the material. Good luck.,0
"Long boring lectures. Spends forever copying his slides onto the white boards without adding any useful information and makes lots of mistakes. Poor explanations, contradicts himself, takes marks off for stupid things like writing a number as a fraction instead of a decimal. Wouldnt let the TA's give us hard copies of the tutorial solutions. Worst",0
At first I was like OMG what did i get myself into. I thought he was a really nice guy. Gives work but he is really helpful if he sees you are trying. He tends to ramble off and loves to listen to himself talk.,1
"Slides really helped get the info across. If you fall behind, you're toast.",1
"Cool guy and a good teacher. His lectures go on forever, but they're absolutely necessary for the tests.",1
"Good macroeconomics professor, although he tends to get off topic with relevant events. The overall material is easy, know your definitions and graph curves for the exams. Only 3 multiple choice exams, Cengage assignments due weekly, and 3 Gordon rule assignments. He sometimes extends assignments and gives exam retakes. I took the 14 wk course.",1
You will not learn anything. Have to memorize a lot. Get an Iphone thats what most of the class did? I didnt do that otherwise I would also get a descent grade. You will cry and memories of class will not go away. You will regret but have no option. EE dept doesnt care about us they onlycare bout money. You be ready to kill your GPA.,0
"Danny is the best acting teacher. He pushes every single student to give their best. After you reach that mark, he pushes you to be even better. I'm grateful for having had him as a Professor. Great scenes too. My class was full of amazing talents.",1
"For the school he is at he was difficult. I have taken five classes from him at this point and have learned so much. He's unique in his approach, but definitely have respect for him, even if I don't always agree with him.",1
"Professor Horan has a very simple grading procedure: if you follow instructions and do the assigned work, you will pass with an A. If you follow the rubrics, you will pass. He is also hilarious and a movie buff so that's a plus. One of the best professors I've ever had.",1
"Easy easy A. Do the online discussions, add a quote or two from the readings, slightly expand and youll get a 100. Ability to get extra credit on every assignment (somehow got it for every one and didnt try). You can put in slight effort and still pass with an A. Highly recommend for a GPA booster.",0
"I work a full time job, and couldn't attend his surprise weekly video-discussions. He said it was a ""shame"" I couldn't skip two hours of work to join and get help. Discussions not recorded. COVID-work related issues caused me to miss a test. No exceptions allowed. Couldn't get help on homework problems unless I knew answers. Tutors were clueless.",0
Morely is an AWESOME teacher! Dont expect an easy class though. If youre serious about learning photography and improving your technical skills and jump-starting your creativity his class will do it! Hes tough on you but its because thats the real world! He knows his stuff! He may be a lil arrogant at times but the class is FUN and totally worth it,1
Fantastic prof! Clearly cares about his students. No surprises but still a challenging class (in a good way if you try). Highly recommended.,1
Best professor ever! She is so sweet and cares so much about her students. I would definitely take her class again. ,1
Excellent teacher! Illustrator is a beast and the Adobe textbook is pretty awful but the projects are great and Johnnie works with individual students to help them do their best work.,1
"I really enjoyed the class I took with Professor Qualls. While I learned a lot, I struggled as well. He gives good feed back on papers, but it's not always clear and is mostly negative. If you don't feel like you're a great writer, I'd be hesitant about taking on of his classes. However, he's a great prof who you'll learn a lot from.",0
The Best Professor!!!!!,1
"Professor Lutfi is not very good at ""dumbing down"" information to our level. He's not good at making sure you understand what information is important or explaining examples well. I used wikipedia to explain a lot of the concepts to myself before the test. I ended up getting an AB, but this was a LOT harder than other the other CSD prereqs.",0
"If you have the option to take another section of WCI, I would highly recommend doing so. She is a tough grader and expects a lot. Do all of the work and go in for extra help. Compared to other professors teaching this course she is very tough. If you do the work, you will do fine.",1
"Jim is honestly one of the only professors in the department that I have had that I feel like knows about the field. I learned more in his class than most of my others combined. He is also one of the most caring individuals I've ever met. His tests are very hard, and he gives a lot of homework. Do your work and youll pass.",1
"While he is very intelligent, if you are the type of learner who needs more explanation, he's not the professor you need. He explains the math problems by the book without further explanation. This course is fast paced and will not slow down for those who learn slower.",0
Had her for my summer program. Not the most pleasant personality but very easy work and an easy A. She actually admired my writing.,0
She was very helpful. I learned how to swim because of her ,1
AVOID AT ALL COSTS. I didn't receive a single essay back until the last day of the semester. The professor is not clear about what she wants at all and she never shows up to office hours to ask questions.,0
HE is awesome and a great teacher,1
Class is impossible and professor does not teach. Only class I did not get an A in this semester.,0
"Professor Zakar was an awesome professor. Took him for Social & Ethical Considerations of Business and he makes it difficult to fail, let alone get a grade below an A. Just do the weekly assignments, discussions, paper, and presentation and you'll be fine. He has an amazing and very relatable personality.",1
"Son cours est divisé en trois: la premiere moitié du cours il parle d'écologie, la deuxième de comptabilité et la troisième c'est un exercices qui vaut 1% à chaque cours. En gros 10% de participation, TP correct mais long. Il divague toujours, il connait super bien la matiere mais l'explique mal, il enseigne au MBA. Parfois pertinent, souvent non.",0
"Professor Sapp is hands down one of the best criminal justice professors! He gives you feedback on your work, responds quickly to answers, his syllabus is pretty simple! You have 8 discussions, 8 lessons and 4 exams! I received an A in his class. You will enjoy his class, I promise!",1
"She's very knowledgable and articulate. Kind of laid back, but she's clear about what she expects. Overall a good professor.",1
Peggy is a pretty solid teacher. She makes her expectations clear and expects you to stick to them. She does mumble sometimes during lectures but it doesn't really matter because if you show up and do the middle school like assignments you pass.,1
"First, I wish you could rate 0. I hope you have a good internet connection. You will be teaching yourself through YouTube videos. The lectures are all over the place. His writing is illedgeable. He often makes mistakes in the notes. My personal favorite he skips steps by taking shortcuts, but he doesnt tell you ��. His test reviews are misleading.",0
Mr. Burt is the worst professor that I have ever taken. His tests are hard but would be doable if he actually taught in class. He gets half the example problems wrong during lecture then when students ask questions he tries to dodge them by answering something he actually knows how to do. Lab is bad because he does not know how to set up the lab.,0
"Polanco is a tough grader but she a very nice professor. The grades included a midterm, final, journals, RPS credit, Reading checks, a final paper, and 5 group projects. It's a lot of work but I enjoyed the class. It's not an easy A, you have to participate to get a good grade!",1
"Horrible horrible professor. She never had a lesson plan prepared, spent half the class just googling things vaguely related to whatever we were talking about, and was just plain awful. Useless papers and feedback. Easy enough, but if you want to learn take someone else.",0
Terry is not the player that should be holding this position.  There are far better teachers in Boston who play better and are better teachers.  Choose someone else if you really want to be a trumpet player.,0
"His grading and homework is straight forward, but its gets boring often. ",0
very easy teacher. just show up to class and pay attention. she takes off a lot of points for not attending which will affect your grade. book is useless. you probably do a couple of assignments from it but that's all. not worth the amount i paid for it in the bookstore. it doesn't even have to be the csun edition. there are no tests taken.,1
She only gave us four exams and a written assignment. Give us lectures then take a test where much of the material wasnt on the exam.,0
"She's not a bad professor. She explains things well and assignments are clear enough. While the homework isn't that difficult, she assigns an obscene amount, and it's super tedious and time-consuming. This is an orientation class and I'm spending more time doing all of these pointless assignments than on my actual homework. Steer clear.",0
Disorganized and does not teach in class,0
"Lewis is a fantastic teacher. He's excellent at explaining the material. In CS 200, you'll write 4 programs and take 2 tests and 1 final. If you have the chance, take Lewis.",1
"Get ready to read, because his PPT slides only glance over what is on the exam. It is very book heavy and his study guides are just the topics you need to read in the book. Learn the terms and go to class because his lectures (although sometimes boring) are based on real life examples. Friendly fellow and takes feedback well.",1
I went into this class with absolutely no clear idea of what it was about. What I came out with four weeks later was a passion for understanding of all things new and exciting. Dr. R is very good at involving his his students in the here and now. I would take any of his classes. In the future I find him interesting as a teacher. A great motivator,1
"Martin's lectures are incredible. You can tell he enjoys teaching the subject. There will be many definitions and ideas that you need to be memorized, but there is always plenty of time to do so before any midterms. While in class, be sure to be avidly taking notes, as there isn't a book or overly helpful slides to review later.",1
"Professor Persaud is a really kind person- if you miss a test, she'll give you the opportunity to make it up easily. Pay attention in class and you'll be fine. The only negative I'd say about her is she can be pretty loud, so maybe don't sit in the first row.",1
"Professor O'Quinn is an extremely knowledgeable professor who knows what he is talking about. However, I found his lectures very hard to follow & did not know what points he was trying to get across a lot of the time. His assignments are ambitious & unclear but he is very approachable and brilliant. Take a class with him if you want a challenge.",0
"This class made no logical sense how would you expect someone to pass a class when you get test/quizzes and , homework on material you haven't even learned yet. His teaching style is so robotic too with little to no emotion what so ever. 0/5 wouldn't meme again.",0
"Lisa is one of Coe's most amazing professors!  She makes the topics fun, intersting, and learnable.  Not too hard, not too easy, really funny, can't say enough about her!  Take her class!",1
Murtuza is a bro! Always willing to help. Sometimes his handwriting is hard to read on the board and he talks kindof quietly. All you have to do is ASK HIM TO REPEAT and he always will because he genuinely cares. Ask for help during or outside of class and he'll even schedule extra office hours. He had Sat & Sun hours during finals week for us.,1
"Everything she said during this class was something to take to heart. She's a wonderful teacher and this was my favorite class, the best I think I've ever taken. It's incredibly personal though so if you're not open to sharing some secrets then it might not be for you. Class was understanding as a whole though and felt like a safe place",1
"She is extremely disorganized and fails to clearly communicate her criteria for writing a paper. It is the day before finals and she has yet to grade/provide feedback for any of my 3 papers, and has lost one of the papers, even though I have provided her a physical copy and electronic copy multiple times. It is astounding that she is a professor.",0
"Makes you buy a $90 access code just to access the homework which is 100 questions PER CHAPTER and you have 2-3 chapters due at a time. Crazy tedious work, each chapter takes about 2 hours to complete. STAY AWAY. Find someone easier.",0
"Prof. Morton is a fabulous instructor, and does everything possible to help students succeed. ",1
"Clear grading criteria, very interesting class, always happy to go, inspirational instructor, open notes on tests. Straight forward class.",1
"This class so so so hard.  She not help me at all.  She think she know everything but don't know nothing.  If you know everything why not help people but since you pretend you do why don't you.  God Says: The righteous care about justice for the poor, but the wicked have no such concern...",0
"TAKE COLLEGE 100, NOT THIS BULL CLASS! I don't know how any of this will help with my nursing career. She doesn't give a rubric or anything and will knock you for the stupidest things. SAVE YOUR TIME AND DON'T TAKE HER COURSE!",0
"Honestly, I am SUPER understanding of professors due to them also having personal lives. This, however, is so different. This class was supposed to be fun and interesting, especially during this election year but turned out to be the worst class I ever had. I had all As this semester besides this class due to disorganization and procrastination",0
He's a bit quirky but was always wins to help if you asked questions. ,1
"THE worst. He is so unprepared, inconsistent & unorganized for every class. The syllabus he uses is from about 10 years ago and never matches with whats actually going on. He has high expectations yet doesn't teach the information well, and makes it like his job is not a priority of his...very disappointing all around",0
"She's rude. Does not know how to engage in conversation. She looks down on her students. At least, made me feel stupid. I agree with the person who mentioned that she discusses student's personal stories in front of everyone. Very invasive. She also does not challenge the students' thinking. Class is super easy and basic. Didn't learn anything new.",0
This is a bad teacher i had so far in north carolina state university. avoid this teacher at any cost. he is the worst teacher you can imagine.,0
Failed me for not doing the last essay when I did every other assignment in the class. Worst teacher at PCC,0
"Great Profesor, very easy to get along with, has a fun loving sense of humor. Excelent teacher very easy to learn from.",1
"Terrible Terrible Terrible. I strongly suggest you do not take her. She marks unfairly, she takes forever to give papers back, she always plays the victim, says she wants to help but offers no help when it comes to your exam. Terrible!",0
"Professor Sposeto is so good! I thought I was just bad at learning languages but I actually learned so much with her! She is very enthusiastic and she's young so her tips about the culture in Italy are recent and helpful. The class has the amount of homework you would expect for a foreign language, but it's really not bad compared to other classes.",1
"The type of teacher that expects everyone in the class to discuss the reader, and is very salty whenever you do not. He also expects you to do writings in 30 minutes and to regurgitate every word of days lectures into each of your papers. Dont take him, take my advice. Hes unforgiving and gave me a 40 point deduction for leaving one topic out.",0
Yonn is a lively individual who enjoys the teacher/student seperation. His teaching style is very ecentric and a bit off the wall at times. overal pretty good instructor. just dont expect him to talk/make eye contact outside of class w you,1
"The materials that she chose for the class were interesting, but she rarely  gave me any meaningful feedback.  Her grading criteria on major assignments was confusing. Plus, she was not super nice when responding to my questions.  I would recommend buying the textbooks via kindle.  Also, ask a classmate first if you have a question.",0
"Professor Stewart in one word: awesome. His dry humor kept me awake throughout this intro level course that I'm sure would otherwise be rather dull. He makes the content engaging and interesting, and is always up for a quick chat during office hours in case you missed anything during lecture. If you get the chance, definitely take Stewart.",1
"While I really want to say I liked this professor, his material was incredibly difficult to understand and he did not seem to understand that we were full time students with a full load and jobs. During finals week he still held a meeting to learn material or present, and wile he did his final the week before, he had two tests due during finals.",0
Mr. Martin grades your papers and gives you the opportunity to correct them. He definitely made me grow as a writer.,1
"Only thing I have to add to this is: she focuses more on poetry than fiction. If you are interested in poetry, take this and she'll teach you how to improve as a poet, but it is also valuable for writers. In fact, on our exam, we were tested only for the poetry readings and poetry terminology; none of the fiction.",1
"He doesnt randomly give pop quizzes, but he does have quizzes frequently. He always ensures you know whats coming up, giving plenty of study time. Try to participate in his lecture even if sometimes it seems silly. I really feel I took away from this class.",1
"Definitely a tough class, but worth it. Her notes and lectures are confusing, but if you read and do the online homework you'll understand what's going on.  She even gives you the types of question that will be on the tests so you can practice online. She's always willing to take time out of class to explain something.  Go and show interest.",1
"Your work is graded by the TA instead of Prof Dong shin. His lectures were ok, boring at times, and consisted of a lot of images.  He's very nice and can be funny at times",1
financial economics. dont do it.,0
"He is an alright teacher, giving it was his first time teaching here. Exams were a bit tricky to me, but I probably just haven't studied it extremely well. Covers a lot of material in this class. His writing on his notes is bad, but legible to an extent. Do well in your lab reports and you will do fine in this class. ",0
I took scientific inquiry for science majors. It was very easy and watered down. PAY ATTENTION IN CLASS because this stuff is applicable in later life. Don't just take this class to get it out of the way,1
One of the worst teachers I have had in my life. He doesn't explain the topics thoroughly at all and he expects students to know the answers. I've never even took the time before to rate a professor but this professor is so bad I need to let other future students aware to stay away. Teaching is not for him and he is setting students up for failure,0
One of the most genuine professors I've had thus far. Cares about all students succeeding,1
Gives you too many questions without enough time to do them since you cant use a calculator,0
"Dennis is a respected artist, but should not be teaching. He shows up 15 minutes late everyday and sometimes takes attendance sometimes doesn't. He gives everyone a B as long as you show up and try. He tells you to watch videos on the internet if you want clarification on anything. He plays on his IPad all class long. No demonstrations ever.",0
Venkata teaches a Chemistry course for non-chem majors. The books were interesting and he is very good about responding to questions promptly.,1
DO NOT TAKE HER! She gives a lot of assignments and takes a long time to grade them. She doesn't explain anything and never responds to emails. Plus a lot of presentations.,0
"It seems like a lot of work but its really not. There is an online quiz for every chapter which makes up a lot of points for the class. One presentation, and one group book. Gives amazing feedback that will help you succeed and pass the class. I wish I could take more classes with Heather!",1
"Mrs. S seems mean at first, but once you show her you are serious about nursing she will love you and help you with everything you need. I can see where some people might not like her, but if you give her a chance you won't want to leave her. I promise!!",1
"JUST TAKE HER, EVEN IF SHE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOUR MAJOR! JENNIFER MCADAM IS THE BEST PROFESSOR AT WILLIAM PATERSON UNIVERSITY.  Never any homework but you gotta study for tests like any other class would.  Papers are easy peasy, just do what she is asking from you.  Professor McAdam is hilarious, and the lectures are always fun.",1
"Everyone's goal in class was simply to survive, and you can, if you take a lot of practice tests, find a good TA (Esther Taxon was a God send) and don't worry about the readings. He gets into random, complicated details in class that are confusing and not on the exam. He's condescending in office hours so I would got to my TA's office hours instead",0
"This class is hard, but Professor Dutta does everything he can to try and give you the opportunity the succeed.  His YouTube videos are a step far beyond what most professors would do.  You should go to class and pay attention.  Doing the practice problem really helps.  Tests are open book, but if you aren't prepared, it won't matter.",1
"Melissa was very helpful and very accessible outside of class. If you uploaded an assignment and it did not show up on Blackboard's end, she reached out to you to let you know so you could email it to her! Some teachers would penalize you.   Group project. Head's up.",1
Great teacher. Actually makes it her priority to make sure you learn the material.,1
I had Dr. ferguson for a blended course. His lectures are rather boring and he words the tests to make the very hard. All of my tests were open book and I averaged between an A and B on them. There is daily quizzes and weekly writings. no extra credit,1
The professor spent the majority of each mandatory class meeting to discuss her personal life and forbade working while she discussed her life. The assignments had little-to-nothing to do with the learning and the learning materials were so basic it felt insulting. Terrible emailer and communicator.,0
You have to teach yourself in order to pass this class. He communicates terribly and even his TAs have no idea what is going on. He only does two examples of questions during lectures that dont even make sense with whats going on. You need the book in order to teach yourself if you want to pass.,0
"Brilliant teacher, passionate,  definitely recommend him. As long as you keep up with the work and ask questions when you're confused on whatever is going on you will do well in the class.",1
"She is the worst! A teacher should encourage a student to do well and motivate to accomplish his/her goals. This course should be fun and not a torture. Susan moss is one pf the worst teachers that ever excited! She discourages and takes points off your grade for spelling, or if your handwritting is not clear!",0
"She is very nice and is willing to answer questions, BUT the exams are HARD HARD and TOUGH!  Why exams are so hard ? ! And part of lecture notes are missing",1
Tough but thorugh.  I liked her... its not as bad as some people said. Quizzes were tough but open book.,1
dread going 2 that class. doesn't talk about anything that is on the tests just talks about 1 topic for more than 3 weeks at a time but than expects you 2 know all that is on the quiz/tests. extremely boring and has too many readings. each assignment is doing a reading from each book which makes things a little confusing. DONT GET HER FOR A TEACHER,0
"What a terrible professor. He rushes through his lectures. We have class Mon and Thurs 8:30-9:45, and this fool always ends it right at 9:30 and relaxes the rest of the day. Tough grader and expects answers in a certain way. Definitely the worst professor I've ever had. Worst part is? You have very few grades. Only 6 hw assignments and 4 exams.",0
He is the most sb professor in BU. I take it for summer term but the homework is two times more than other class in regular semester. And we all think he has OCD because he just wants us to do everything in the exactly way he wants. I don't think he knows he can grade A in this class. I feel like my time is wasted and I did not learn anything.,0
"I was looking very forward to this class, however, taught myself the information. This was the first online class I have had at FAU where I did not receive much feedback and professor was somewhat disengaged regarding class discussions. Also final is 30% of your grade and you are on your own, no study guide and no guidance on what to focus on.",0
"FInishing my third year in this field and she is truly one of the driest lectures and most useless teachers I have had. Reviewing for tests is impossible, between the half empty slides with color clashing font, and spending hours just trying to find readings she gives using only a name and date. Shoots down questions in-lecture, truly the worst.",0
"Offered upwards of 6% Ex Cr. 7 Homeworks 23%. 4 Exams (65%) Most curved. Easy class as far as getting the points, he gives you huge study guides for the tests. The bad part is even if you're interested in Astronomy he's so monotone and non-interactive with the class that most people are falling asleep. Really unfortunate if you like this stuff.",1
"Started off liking him as a professor and slowly began to really hate him. As many people have said, his lectures weren't great. His tests were very confusing in his set up since he did them through Moodle, although the class required web assign and could've just done it through there. Refused to give back credit due to syntax and was mostly rude.",0
"This was my first online math class and I have to say that she was the absolute best! Email response time was very quick and she reopened all of the assignments at the end so we could make up any homework we missed. The tests were just like the homework problems. I wish she would have uploaded more video lectures, but it wasn't a big deal.",1
she's alright.. she's really tough with grading papers but she does give you good feedback.. she takes attendance and you can't miss more than three times.,0
"I had London last fall and I never knew this website existed until now,  and I am so glad because I feel it is necessary to tell people just how awful this professor was! I have transferred schools because of the poor experience I had with this professor!",0
Great teacher. Makes math not so boring. Sound just like the guy on King of the Hill. Tons of homework but that is what made me get a good grade. Very willing to help. Does not talk down to you like some teachers and will help till you understand. Taking him again.,1
Kelli has great industry experience from before she was a professor and does a great job of incorporating that into her lectures. If you show up prepared and ready to participate Kelli is a great teacher. If you just want to sit in the back and never talk it will be harder for you to get the full experience of her class.,1
Dr. Collins was so focused on the students she knew from the psyc department that she gave little attention to anyone else. She does not post her lectures on BlackBoard so attending class is a must. She is a difficult grader on papers and will take 10-15 points if you do not structure it the way she prefers (even if content is there).,0
Douglas was not much help to me.,0
"Sharma is a good guy who is willing to help you if you ask for it. He does go pretty quickly so it is important to try and stay on top of things. This class is more than doable if you go to class, do the homework and study.",1
"This man is a real gem, one of the few professors I've had who truly cares about his students and their education. His lectures are great, but he really shines when you visit him outside of class, which there really isn't an excuse NOT to do since he has walk-in office hours pretty much all day during the week and even occasionally on the weekends!",1
"MIA most of the semester, very late in grading (end of semester), confusing instructions, late in opening up assignments. If you have to take the class, expect delays cause he isn't going to be a pro active instructor. The class would be a great class if the instructor would instruct!!!",0
"Discrimination, no science only politics! Hater of many ethnicities, including Russian people. Hater of some religious. He was disrespectful even to his wife during the class. The worse person I have ever meet. He is not a scientist because his mind is full of political propaganda!",0
"Well lets put it this way. I got an A in the class. I didnt buy the book. I listened to her lectures and took some notes and thats about it. Just do the projects and put some effort into it. I never studied for tests but dont be fooled by that, just take notes during her lectures and you should be fine. Easy B/A :) Good teacher. Chill class, I advi",1
"Great choice for Psych, it's always an interesting lecture. Do the homework, which is super easy, and you'll pass every exam. Gives extra credit every once in a while which can be helpful during exams. Highly recommend this professor!",1
Not very good,0
You will read 4 books for the semester over 400 pgs and then take test on them. Very blunt teacher.  Absolutely no phones what so ever. Get ready to listen and participate.,1
"She is one of the best professors I have ever had. She will give you hints on tests when you are stuck! Her class was extremely fun and if you need extra help, visit her office and she will help you with everything you need! She is honestly one of the kindest and most amazing professors in the Language Department!",1
"He'd be fine for someone who is into reading, analysis, and writing detailed papers but I was really just out here tryna get my 102 credit. He's a good guy but his grading is pretty tough, his directions are so confusing, and you have to read so much of the textbook. So if you can, don't take him but if you're stuck it's not the end of the world.",0
"If you get her good luck, she's tough and won't really help you that much. Not understanding at all and is sometimes very rude. Very strict, so strict we had a seating chart in college.",0
"Lynn talks excruciatingly slowly and the lectures are painful. She grades homework so harshly for absolutely no reason and doesn't explain things well AT ALL. I would rather drop out of college than take this class again. She made me cry on the first day and if you like yourself at all, don't take her class. You will fail.",0
"Holly does not teach the class. She spends the whole class talking about her personal life and will spend 10 minutes at the end of class barely teaching coding, and keeps us 10 minutes late after class because she doesn't want to teach during the actual class. She doesn't care about shy people and grades extremely hard. Lynda will be your friend.",0
"I came into Financial Accounting expecting the worst, and it really was not bad. I credit Dr. Chiu for this. The workload was very manageable and she clearly laid out her expectations for students. Very intelligent. Good professor overall.",1
Very unclear and confusing professor. If you really want to learn about acoustics choose another professor because this one can't teach.  Taking this professor may put you in jeopardy and make your chances of getting in Lehman's Graduate Program for Speech Pathology very slim.,0
"Horrible teacher.  I skipped 1001 because of my ACT scores, and I dropped this class right after midterms.  He gave me a 0 on m first paper because my criteria was not clear enough, and a 0 on my second paper because I used the word ""they"" instead of ""she.""  I do NOT recommend him to anyone.",0
Do NOT take this Professor! Ever! Run! Quick change classes and SAVE YOURSELF! Worst Prof. Ever.,0
"If you're going to get your students to buy a textbook about Brazil, assign more than 50% of the readings on Brazil, and spend 70% of the lectures time talking about Brazil and remembing all the good times you had in Brazil, DON'T title your course ""Latin America."" She is like a one-hit-wonder band from the 90's with nothing new to say.",0
"Waxler is very passionate about his area in study, but he is also very boring, I found myself falling asleep in class. We had a quiz once a week, very easy 5 points, just read the stories he assigns and they were actually very intersting. He goes on even when class is overy probably 5 minutes after. He says class in mandatory but i never went.",1
great sensei,1
"Previous commentor missed out. While Prof. Murphy's  lectures may have been easy to skip, they were also very interesting. Fun class and learned a lot.",1
"Dr. Walker is a great professor. I have taken him for two classes and I have loved him for both. He is a very funny, caring, respected professor. He is always willing to help out and cares for his students deeply. I would definitely recommend taking him.",1
The most sweetest English teacher ever. Gives the best lectures and she's hilarious. If you fail that class it's because you don't want to do anything. She gives snacks every class. I took her for Enc1101 Tuesdays and Thursdays but she only said to come Thursdays. We only did 5 essays which you only turn in 3 and just do Mylabplus .,1
"Not a very good teacher, annoying, and tests you on your ability to memorize the name of songs rather than actual understanding of the material. She also picks only songs she likes and has been known to play the same songs over and over again (5-10 per class). Definitely wouldn't recommend to a friend.",0
"Would not recommend this instructor. Very unorganized, it takes him forever to return exams. He seems too busy with outside life",0
Dr. Wydner is very helpful inside and outside of the lab. She's easy to contact and gives a lot of extra credit. ,1
"The worst teacher I have ever had from elementary school to college. I took his astronomy course as a visiting student a few summers ago. I go to a college that is ranked top 30 in the country and was expecting to do well in this course. Not only was he an awful teacher, he made you feel stupid for asking questions and if you dont understand.",0
"Chris is a great professor and a cool person. He is very interactive with the students on class, and he always keeps the lecture exciting. The material is easy and all tests were multiple choice. Mini courses outside of lecture were also interesting and were easy points towards your grade.",1
"Linear algebra: Gupta does nothing to inspire students: reading straight off slides, he teaches computations and definitions s.t. when students like myself try to employ intuition he fails to understand our thought process. Neglects any curiosities you have in topics not directly addressed in the textbook. 3Blue1Brown will be your best friend.",0
"Loved her. She clearly laid out everything in her syllabus, including a daily schedule each class. Shes very caring. All books are free on her website b/c she doesnt want us to stress about $. No tests, just short readings & a project. Its not a cake walk, but its pretty hard to fail her class since she will motivate you. Highly recommend.",1
"motivate? he constintly puts people down, refering to their personal lives, and when asked for help often catches an attitude. He makes you work double hard to earn extra days off, but the days have to be benificial to him. He plays favorites badly so kiss butt!",0
"he rambles on and expects us to do lab assignments and homework AND turn something in at the lecture AND gives us WAY too much pointless homework. hes never at the labs, he has is TAs do it because he is way too lazy. he doesn't grade that hard, but he still doesnt know how to teach.  he expects us to know everything already.",0
"Rude, unforgiving, does not participate in BB discussions",0
"i do not like him at all. he seems so full of himself. he is not understanding, yet everyone understands him and respects him. he has this attitude i dont like. it's a very hard class, confusing, impossible to catch up. i studied so much for so many hourse and guess what his test question was? Who is the author of the textbook?",0
his class was ok. I like the fact that Dr. Thompson is fair. I took his class during Covid-19 so both the class and the lab was online. On a quiz we had to name the bones of the cranium and for a particular section it was very difficult to label without being shown in person. He understood this and graded the quiz accordingly with a curve.,1
Formula sheets can be used on tests which is a great bonus. He provides reviews and the tests are very similar. He gets kind of angry with students who don't put in 100% and you needs to be present in class or a lot will be missed and you could get lost. He also provides bonus points but it can be revoked if you miss 2 classes. Overall pretty good.,1
"She's a genuinely a good person. If you go in after class to ask for help you can tell she really wants to help you . However, this means nothing since she is not a native speaker; you literally cannot understand her. She is also unforgivably strict on assignments, and will not accept anything from you if you are even five minutes late to class",0
"He is a very difficult grader, but he doesn't seem too bad overall.",0
"This was a great  animation class. Kathleen's demos and lectures were inspiring and she really cares about helping everyone to achieve their best results. She's an animation pro and knows what it takes, is willing to share her knowledge and skills, our school is lucky to have her. Grading was fair and feedback was  always kind and helpful.",1
"3 tests, 1 final, no homework. Have to teach yourself. He is convinced that every problem in the world is caused by Obama. I'm a republican, but the banter gets old.",0
"Martha Steffens is best described as completely, totally, and utterly incompetent.  She doesn't care about her Econ 1051 Journalism class.  And she is completely computer illiterate.  The class is really easy, but she is a bore of a teacher.  Take it, don't go, and just read the power points online.  You'll be fine.",0
"Professor Dewan has a very heavy accent that is difficult to understand. If you try to ask a question because you did not know what he said, he will put you down. His lectures make no sense and spends half the time complaining about his students. You can attend every class and jot down every word he says and you will not learn a thing.",0
"If you are someone who runs late sometimes like I am, don't take this class. Quizzes on readings were not hard but given in the first minute of class - if you miss it, you were ""absent"" and get a 0/100 for the day (with only 3 allowed per semester). Some extra credit offered by writing papers. Tests are all essay and definition and are not easy.",1
One of the nicest men ive ever met. If you ask him a question he probably wont hear you. You dont need the textbook if you show up to class. I rarely went to class and walked out with a B. Make sure you show up when he gives you the Unit test to study and you'll be fine.,1
"knows her content but is not good at making sure students do. Prepare to teach yourself because she definitely won't be teaching you anything herself. extremely slow talker so unless you care about how words sound its hard to pay attention. In terms of content, unless you're going to be a linguist, you will never use irl",0
Great professor overall. James gives good lectures that are very clear and intellectual. The labs assigned provide knowledge in the course material and his grading is more than fair.,1
"She knows her material, but not how to teach or grade it. She grades on page space filled rather than quality of content with notes and will give normal scantron tests at home with confusing questions on material not covered in class at all.",0
"At first when she explain the grading curve I thought she seemed like a fair professor. Then my semester of hell started. She was terrible at explaining physics and she was constantly unprepared. She would blame the students for ""not reading"" the textbook when her examples were wrong. She would lose everyone during her in-class examples. Terrible!",0
"Professor Bennett is very approachable, nice, accommodating to her students and is willing to change due dates on major assignments. Her classes mainly consist of group work, but she does let students choose their own group members. If you want to earn a good grade, do yourself the favor of keeping up with all of the canvas discussions.",1
"One of the most amazing human beings you will encounter. Teaching: very patient, knowledgeable, and enthusiastic. Personal: extremely caring and understanding. Don't abuse her kindness and motherly figure, she will snatch your head off. Hence the negative feedback. Easy A if do HW and revise 2-3 hours a week. You'll have nothing to complain about.",1
"extremely intelligent, one of my favorite classes of my college career. it was evolutionary psychology, senior seminar. man i loved that class. i think if people think it's boring it might just be they're not that into the material or something.",1
Great teacher. Very organized. Everything is on the syllabus. As long as you do all your homework and your essays on time you will get a good grade.,1
Does not let you make up missed homework everything online and she doesnt clearly go over everything such as tenses,0
"Not an ""easy A"" class but she's a good professor. Funny at times and has a lot of interesting things to say about the subject. If you work hard you should do well.",1
"Amazing professor, would highly recommend.",1
Professor Henao was an amazing professor. My first semester of Spanish my teacher never gave us exams or homework really but then took this for SPN1120 and it was very different. She gives exams but they are easy if you do the study guide. Also there's a lot of online homework but you can finish in 5 minutes. She's very sweet and cares about grade,1
"Extremely unorganized. She expects you to be in class but was late for class a lot herself or cancelled. She didn't seem to know what she was doing. Required three textbooks for the class, more reading involved than English classes. She required you to also write 5 papers. Her PowerPoints were extremely long, and her lectures were boring and dry.",0
Good teacher but huge ego. If he is wrong about something he has to get his way and exchanges really passive aggressive emails in some cases when the topic is out of his field. He is a good person though and besides that his class is easy. I got an A though I can't complain.,1
The one thing I liked about her is that her tests are usually like the review. One thing I didnt like was how strict she was on grading essays. She would take up to 15 points off for slightly citing something incorrectly and acted as if this were an English class instead of a sociology class. Her lectures were pretty boring but overall Was nice,0
"Being in class, especially for labs, is really important. He is willing to help you if you need to the help but if you blow him off, you're out of luck. If you miss a lecture or two you may be okay but make sure that you study on your own. The tests come from the lectures and the study guide so definitely at least look at the guide. ",1
"I took this class online and the textbook was not absolutely needed as everything on quizzes, assignments, and tests was in the notes provided.",1
He just talks on and one and on an on. Show up and stay awake and you will pass . It is an easy class just boring.,0
Very enthusiastic about his job. Like many other people taking his class I had an A in the discussion section which counted as 85% of the total grade but must have failed the other 15% of the lecture portion as I ended up with a B in the class. When I went to visit him he was very unhelpful and disrespectful. Avoid or participate A LOT!!!!!,0
"Professor Adams gives very delayed feedback and is not good with responding to inquiries. There are unclear expectations for assignments, yet she grades harshly. Very critical. ",0
"He was fun, entertaining, and kept the class interested. He was also incredibly helpful to those who struggled. He even took the entire class out to dinner for study time, in preparation to the final exam. That was the best, because everyone felt at ease to ask questions. He is a great teacher.",1
Great teacher. Super smart.,1
"He expects you to know what he is talking about. Walks out of class while you do classwork, brushes you off if you have a question. Not very helpful, but he is nice.",0
"He is terrible. The class is fairly easy, but overall he is really rude and mean. I turned in an assignment that had 2 parts. I turned in the first part and emailed him the second part because it was a picture. He then told me to submit through canvas after I had already emailed it to him. A month later, he tells me to email it to him NOW. so rude",0
Klatzke is a great professor. She is very enthusiastic about her topics and always gets you involved in class. Never boring. Easy grader. Only a few very east quizzes (you can use your book)and a midterm and final that are only moderately tough. Speeches are easy and you learn to love it. I would recommend her to anyone.,1
"All of his tests are short answer, but if you take good notes and study you will pass. Gets off topic a lot too.",1
"Good teacher. She expects discussion every class, so you need to read every night. You MUST buy the textbook to pass this class. She is VERY anal about reading and paying attention in class. If you don't do either of these things, expect to get chewed out.",1
"As long as you do the readings and get the main idea out of the reading, you should be good.",1
"She gives lots of work with no instructions. I pretty much taught myself everything. In the beginning of the semester she told me ""there are no questions to be asked in this class"" by that time there was no professors left from me to choose from. Thankfully I got a B, and the reason I say thankfully is because the test brought everyones grades down",0
Gail was amazing! She is very helpful and wants to see you succeed. Make sure to ask questions because she loves to demonstrate and show you how to effectively do a skill. She is very caring and wants to see EVERYONE move on from NURS 110. She loves honesty. If you make a mistake own it and tell her and she will respect you as a nurse.,1
She is an amazing and kind person who cares about her students and does her best to help them succeed; she always makes herself available to her students. She can be VERY disorganized so it's important to read everything before class and really know the material b/c in lectures she can be confusing but will help make connections once you understand,1
"Tends to use internet videos as a tool to teach students and requires students to participate in saying what they learned from the video. If not, a pop quiz is promptly given. Lectures given are over  PowerPoints that are recited word for word.  Doesn't express much enthusiasm in the field of psychology.",0
"I had to withdraw this class cause of the load work hed expect from us, do not take this class if you dont like to read",0
"I miss Mr.Tamm! He's a great teacher, and class was fun because his adorable and endearingly dorky personality is so entertaining. We had to write 5 papers and take 2 tests in each class I took. The tests are easy, and taking notes wasn't necessary since they're available on the class website. Just read through them once and you should get an A. :)",1
"If you can avoid taking her, please do. she responded to only 1/10 emails i sent her, cancelled assignments, posted content for tests late, and would post details a day before something was due. she was v unorganized and the worst professor i have ever had at loyola (and i tend to give professors the benefit of the doubt.)",0
"To start off Dr. Bazil is very disorganized, which led him to not follow the syllabus. When a paper was turned in it would take 3-4 weeks to receive the grade back . He also duplicates the written feedback so it's not a personal feedback response. I would not recommend taking this professor. He does not answer questions that are asked in class.",0
"Every time I went to class I struggled to stay awake. He always wants the class to answer questions, and nobody ever does. Nobody knows the answers. I feel lost every single day in that class. He asks questions on quizzes and tests that we never went over in class. He uses useless info from the small print in the book. Horrible teaching.",0
She is horrible! Doesnt care about the students overall and seems nice at first but be aware!!!,0
"Very nice woman. She will help students by accommodating them however they might need. Hard to understand but always free to help. Only two tests and one final, so not a lot of hope if you want to bring your grade back up. She teaches really fast, like she's in a rush. Attendance is taken but doesn't count towards your grades. Extra credit is given",1
There are weekly discussion posts and assignments each week. I thought it was a little too much but they weren't so bad. There were 3 exams ( short essay questions) with no time limit and you have one week to complete it. He's a very laid back prof and allows students to turn in assignments in late which can be good or bad! Great person!!,1
"Excellent professor.She goes over exactly whats gonna be in the test.the only thing dont be absent to her class. I got an A+ in her class, gives lots of extra credits.TAKE HER!!!",1
"he doesn't care he put resp. on his TAs.  TAs are not helpful. He is unorganized.  His lec. notes don't have title and are bad hand writing.  The TAs were not helpful to answer the questions and hehimself does,t care to listen.  At last some TAs curved and some didn't.  If you don't have to don't take this class. It lowers your grades and takes tim",0
She is a tough grader.,0
This man makes my life worth living.,1
2 Homework sections a week. Discussions are hard to understand. Difficult class. I took it online.,1
Literally the worst teacher I have ever had. Only grades exams. Doesn't speak the best English and you'll need a translator to understand him. I would not recommend him to anyone.,0
Professor Cramer is a saint among men. He's very understanding when it comes to unforeseen situations sometimes plague students and late assignments. By far one of my favorite professors at Suffolk.,1
My class topic for ENGL115 was exploring Anti-Blackness and Pepper never skipped a beat in providing credible articles on the subject. There is a lot of peer-reviewed assignments so be prepared to write and check your word counts. Actually really breezy for an English class and you always receive great feedback on your work!,1
"He is mad boring...it's like watching paint dry..hes a nice guy, but hes an accountant not a teacher so he just tells you how it works instead of teaching it to you..",0
She doesn't teach. She just keep talking about stuff. I have to go through the book all by myself in order to pass. Her class is boring ,0
Susan is AMAZING. She has so much knowledge on the sect of pre-production and she makes every class fun and interesting. She will help you if you take inititive and ask! She helped me a ton. Best professor I probably will ever have!,1
Shenoy was my favorite professor this year. What I like about the way he teaches is that if there is something in the textbook that he doesn't use in his engineering job he just won't teach it to us. I felt like I was learning about things I would actually use in my job which is great. He also gives extra credit opportunities. Hw is sometimes hard.,1
"Nice professor. Classes are really relaxed, he lectures on some interesting topics and relates to students well. Fairly easy course (as it is a lower division GE)...few reaction papers (1-2 pages) quizzes and tests are pretty easy if you go to class (though a lot of the course is common sense, or easy to absorb). Great professor.",1
"A very hardworking professor whose passion is for music.  She takes time to make sure you understand the work.  Helps in class, tutoring, and gives extra sources to help via blackboard. Make sure when taking this class you choose a suitable time (class is about 2 hrs) to make sure you're fully awake when playing the piano and always take notes.",1
prof experimenté et maitrise bien la matiére,1
Absolutely stunning and electrifying lectures!,1
"Lectures verbatim out of textbook for first few weeks, then makes you read the chapters by yourself. Very manageable but avoid if possible.",0
"You ask a simple question in class, you get a long winded, confusing answer. The lectures were extremely disorganized, didn't even follow her own handouts. If you politely approach her with concerns or need for clarification, get ready for some passive aggression. 200+ pages read per class mainly not discussed, but they're definitely on the test.",0
Amazing. My very first...and by far my FAVORITE instructor. She made class EXCITING and engaging. I wanted to go to class. She inspired me. The work was fun and used your creativity. Susan is insane in the best possible way. TAKE HER CLASS!!,1
"DO NOT RECOMMEND. She is an extremely tough grader. And is very nit-picky w/answers. Her powerpoints for the lectures are very confusing and didn't have a good flow throughout, they were very hard to follow and study. she gives quizzes every Thursday (worth 15 pt). she made us buy a mobile chem app (used only 12-15 times) and a HW website. AVOID.",0
"If you take his class, get ready to learn on your own! He made so many lecture mistakes that it more often confused people than help them out. The only plus side is that the exams will not have anything outside the homework and lecture material.",0
"Les is the man.  Very easy, very knowledgeable, and very sweet.  Gives 1 midterm, 1 final, and a paper, tells you word for word what you need to put in your paper and what you need to study for the midterm and final. has a weird teaching style and talks with his eyes closed, but he is very nice and always helpful in understanding material. great!!",1
"I honestly don't understand how he got good reviews. He is a very tough grader who can be very rude and mean depending on his mood. His exam is 85% of the total grade and I was never able to finish them (I studied a lot). I never missed his class or hw and still got B-. Even I take the same class again, I don't think I'll be able to do better",0
She is a very nice woman. I really enjoyed her class because she made me comfortable for my first year of college. Her grading is very lenient and she is very understanding towards her students. Her class is an easy A and I would definitely take again!,1
"I am a straight A student, so I'd like to think I have some credibility. Maybe the problem is that Mastering Physics is a terrible system to try to teach with. However, she does not teach thoroughly.  Read the textbook regularly, it helps. See her after class, she explains info well there. Her lectures are useless, though.",0
"The easiest class I have ever taken. We met three times a week, but attendance was not mandatory. I showed up for the first two days of the semester, and never showed up ever again. He has three exams all semester (all essays) and they are really easy if you go to the LA session right before the exam and you will get all the info you need. Easy A",1
I took this class online during the pandemic and she made the process so easy! She made all assignments due at the end of the semester and gave multiple attempts for assignments. She also squeezed me into her class last minute so she was definitely super caring and always willing to help. Just get your work done and its an easy A mostly.,1
"Shes the worst prof I have ever had at bsu. She doesnt care youre a college student, she doesnt care if you have to wait until pay day to buy her mandatory expensive textbook ( which she only wants you to buy bc her weak writing is included. Certainly she did not publish anything decent) shes no willing to help. She always thinks shes right",0
"Very negative and grades harshly. Very picky in her feedback, but does not give any grade number (only letter grades) so it's hard to be objective about grades. Really need to keep up on the readings and participate in class.",0
I took Alisa for math 108 and from the very beginning found her very hard to stay interested.  She was very monitone.  She also rarely worked problems on the board unless asked.  I went from 2 prior classes with an A to having to withdraw from her class.  I would NEVER recommend her to anyone.  She is super nice though but that's all I can say.,0
"About 45% of a math final made up of impossible T or F. Comes to class with no preparation. Most of the time students finish the problem for him. Never explains any terminology, yet expects us to know it for the exams. Likes to put on tricky problems. Won't take the time to answer questions. Kinda cocky in the British way. I def wouldn't recommend.",0
Tough grader. Rude. Stubborn.,0
"Professor Bacardi is an amazing teacher. He is dedicated to making sure that his students learn and understand the material. He is always available to provide his students with feedback on assignments. For an introductory level class, it was a little difficult. As long as you do the readings and pay attention during the lectures, you will be okay!",1
"Do the homework, come to class and you will be just fine. This is the first professor who actually helped me understand stats.",1
Two words: STAY AWAY! I have never in my life had such an anal teacher. Words can't describe how horrible this class is. He thinks this is your only class for the entire semester. Tests were ridiculously hard. No guidelines on time consuming project. The class went to Dean about this guy. Bottom line: STAY FAR AWAY!!,0
"Dr. Buck is very helpful, though his teaching style is very confusing. His lectures are boring. The class is fairly easy you could pass without having to show up to class. Also his study guides for his exams are not helpful at all just the essay questions. I would never take another class from him.",0
i called him professor fidel nicastro all semester.  the online homework is terrible.  a lot of memorization cause he doesnt give you the equations you actually need.  huge curve at the end becuase everyone fails.  he gets really pissed off if the class doesnt answer questions so just hope theres someone who knows what they are doing.,0
"Roberta will do everything in her power to lower your grade. She'll close online quizzes early so you cant do them, she'll take 10% of your grade away for handing in a word document over a PDF and she doesn't post power points or any helpful learning material for exams. You wouldn't learn much from her lectures, nor will you be entertained.",0
"Very good teacher, gives ALOT of work though. As long as you work and work hard you will be ok. Answers emails fast and is helpfull",1
"I was so looking forward to this class, in the beginning. I enjoy writing, after all. Unfortunately, this teacher is boring, rude, and is unwilling to help her students. Do not take this class, it is unnecessarily difficult.",0
He made the class really fun with his jokes and zoom backgrounds. He dropped 29 knewton homework and made it extra credit for those who did all of them. His gradings are merciful(with partial credits ). Do the exam review resources he provides on canvas and you are set. The textbook is for free but honestly I have never looked at it.,1
"Took this as an online class. Every week there's a homework and a quiz. They weren't super hard, but VERY time consuming. Finding answers in the text were often hard. Only tests are a Midterm and Final, lots of questions and difficult to retain all that information, especially when this is an elective class and you are not a science major.",1
"One of the worst decisions you could make in your life to take this prof. Unintelligible, lacks knowledge, and his lectures are all over the place. He shows us useless videos and you literally cannot understand what he is saying most of the time. Project/labs are difficult and asks for more than what he teaches. Literally regret taking him so much.",0
Not mandatory but she goes over what will be on the exams in class. If you want to make an A show up to class.,1
awful...seems nice in class but not helpful at all! NEVER responded to emails regarding my grade on a test. tests were so random and you had no idea what would be on there..awful!,0
Doesn't teach. Tax is a hard enough course as it is and Daria makes it unbearable. Very slow in getting back to you in regard to anything. Avoid if you can and take John Li,0
Total disaster couldn't get a hold of him. Don't take if you want surprises when it comes to your grade after the class is over and you see what your grade is. Grades in blackboard are different from the actual grade given.,0
"One of the best professors I have had, ever! She is so nice and helpful, and is also great at lecturing. Her tests were hard, but really encouraged me to study and I ended up learning more in this class than any other science class I have taken at SU. I REALLY recommend her.",1
"I enjoyed my drafting class so much. Professor Zaykoski was super helpful whenever anyone was confused. His teaching style is clear, concise, and thorough which I appreciated.",1
"She was like a guide introducing us to this brand new world that you can tell she was passionate about. Was the class hard? Yes! However, its better to learn from someone with her knowledge about the ocean than just out of a textbook. Do not miss the field trips. Theyre incredible!",1
"This guy is awful. He is not too smart. His writing looks like he is hadnicapped and he cannot spell simple words. I question how he got hired and how he has a college degree, but if you look at his university page you can see where he got his degrees. Not impressive. Take this class with someone else that is actually educated.",0
"Although you can miss days I wouldn't recommend it cause he tends to throw some curve balls in with the weekly quiz but he does do study guides for exams.  Overall he is an amazing teacher and has some interesting stories about his roses, and really gets you interested in plants in our daily lives.",1
"Dr. D is very friendly and caring. Her tests reflect the content well, and she incorporates lots of examples/related activities in the lectures. Very enthusiastic & quirky. But I also think she is a very average professor - not too extraordinary or mind-blowing.",1
"G.O.A.T! Great class, simple online quizzes. The lectures are online, great sense of humor, he tells you what will be on the test in the lectures. I read the book to find the other answers for the test, everything is in the book and lectures. Easy-A tests, it is open book and open notes. I am taking his other classes as well.",1
"Great Professor. Not an easy A, but there are plenty of opportunities to bring up your grade. She does require you to learn Spanish. Uses many teaching techniques and in class activities. Very fun!",1
"Excellent, Knowledgeable, fare professor",1
"This class was extremely easy.  When I first registered for this class, I thought that it would be the most interesting class, but Joe is a very boring teacher.  He has tons of experience but does not know how to teach students.  He is very soft spoken and can be hard to understand.  The class is easy but you won't learn anything.",0
She's fantastic. BI202 is framed in a way for non-biology majors and it's done impeccably. Lectures are very engaging and I also like how exams are graded on a curve. Definitely recommended.,1
"OK professor. This class was very easy, but his attempt to teach/help was never sufficient enough. My classmates always seemed frustrated to follow and he'll mock you if you didn't understand. I didn't need to attend his class to pass his tests b/c I felt like the textbook was much more helpful! I'd say it's only mandatory to turn in hw/for tests.",0
DO NOT take this class if you're in chem 121. The professor is not good at teaching that class. She is disorganized and does not go off the syllabus. The tests are ridiculously hard and you would get a much better grade taking Van Huizen. My lab partner is in VH's class and is much better prepared for everything.,0
"Dr. Tripp is one of the best professors I've had here so far. He teaches purely based off of examples, and if you don't understand it, he is always willing to try and help. He never makes you feel bad about not understanding or answering incorrectly. Overall, he's an awesome guy.",1
She is really funny and unique. She is also there to answer your questions if you have any. You get to correct your homework yourself as long as you do it and mark the questions you will get complete credit for the work. There are a lot of quizzes and tests but that is to be expected in a language class.,1
I loved taking her class and regret that I didn't take one of hers sooner. She's one of the better teachers I've had and she's willing to help on her papers and the final and gives the option of rewrites at the end of the semester. She makes the class fun and relates it to topics that might come up in the media as well. ,1
"This class is so so easy if you are a logical person (I am a mechanical engineering major and I never had to study for this class), but if you struggle with logic then this class will be a big effort, so many people dropped.. either you are really good or really bad at this class I guess",1
"The worst professor I have ever had at SMU. He doesn't respond to emails, does not post grades online, and rarely gives back tests. His handwriting is at a 6th grade level and he ridicules students in front of the entire class to the point where multiple people have dropped because of it. 46 people have dropped from my class if that says anything.",0
Get rid of the sentence patterns. Errr. Tries his best to help but doesn't always help that much. He lost me very easily and I felt confused 90% of the time.,0
"He's a great professor.  He genuinely cares about his students and cares about their progress in the class.   It's a tough class, but he'll do his best to help you.  Exams are kind of tough, but make sure you go to class.  If you don't, you'll get confused.",1
"Soft speaker. Has a distinct Chinese accent, so slightly more difficult to understand. Ask a question and he will answer it. Teaches by the textbook but is very knowledgeable on the topic. Homeworks are difficult but prepare you for tests. Tests are mixed. Grades tests and homeworks in a very timely manner. No late homework accepted. No calculator.",1
"He is very very helpful, and wants you to learn the material.  As boring as I find math, he made it interesting and easy to learn.  He is an excellant professor!",1
"Could never understand what he was saying with his accent. Even if I could the lectures were boring and couldn't pay attention. I studied the material myself outside of class. Pop quizzes but he drops 3- although he ended up dropping 4 and an exam because so many people were struggling. Bought the book but never used, all powerpoints are online.",0
"As long as you turn in your essay on time, you will get a B no matter how awful it truly is. To get an A in the class, you really have to work for it. She does not have a rubric that tells you how each essay is graded. You won't learn a thing in this class.",0
Be prepare to read a lot and to write a lot of notes. Study the review sheets. Not just the definitions but know how to apply them. With that said once you do your papers and be in attendance you will pass. Easy A.,1
"This was supposed to be a 2 professor course, but it ended up being just her. Honestly it was such a horrible course and very dreadful. 99% of the people in this class NEVER paid attention to her. Kinda felt bad, kinda didn't. Don't bother emailing her, she'll never reply. Nice person, horrible professor. If you don't mind busy work it's an easy A",0
Professor Imam is a wonderful person. He is willing to challenge his students and help you succeed if you are patient with him.,1
"Assigns on average 8 hours of homework per week for a 2 credit course, and just rescheduled an exam to the day before it was supposed to happen, with 2 hours of notice.",0
"He is a nice guy... But, unfortunately he does not teach anything that you will be tested on. He claims that he is teaching to help you for a future in marketing. However, his activities and slides were irrelevant and unhelpful. I wish he brought in guest speakers and taught some of the processes from the dense textbook. ",0
"If you took Intro to Chem in HS prior to this class, you might want to reconsider! There is loads of homework (online, texbook, lab, etc.) & so much money to be spent all on supplies for the class. Easy grading if you do all the work, but 4 midterms is NOT it. She expects you to memorize absolutely everything. Had to drop due to too much stress!",0
"If you do the extra credit and go to class, this class should be an easy A. Her grading system is weird, but she gives you sooooo many opportunities for extra credit. Being in class was a waste of time, but she did have some assignments in class. She doesn't really lecture, but instead just goes over practice problems which rarely helped.",1
"Mrs. Bowlin does not teach at all. she just sits there and reads the ""questions"" that will be on the test. i have not really learned anything in the class. and we don't have any type of disscussion. any time that there is an attempt at disscussion from one of the students she shoots it down.",0
"Stay Away. Only grades are 5 tests, each 20% of final plus each one only has three questions. Misleading about curve. Since each test is worth two letter grades, one mistake and you fail the class. Speaks poor english. No help if stuck and no extra credit. Take other classes to avoid this professior.",0
"Wetlands, H. Plants.  Extremely fair, excellent teacher.  He does not simply teach the subject, he teaches EVERYTHING!!!!  City dwellers be prepared to get your mind blown.  If you want to learn about nature take his courses.  If you take it because you need to get credits to finish your teaching degree, this is not for you. Do not disrespect him!",1
"I wouldnt recommend this teacher even to my worst enemy. She is completely inconsiderate, assigns work late at night that is due the very next morning, and called our class cry babies. Genuinely the most bitter, awful teacher. Do not take her class.",0
"Didn't post the syllabus until a month into class, sent an email taking us all by surprise saying our reading load had doubled for the night, expects you to get make-up notes before class when you don't have people's numbers/emails and cannot get them until class. He's very unclear. AVOID. This /WAS/ going to be my research area. Ruined it for me.",0
"At first he may seem a little rough around the edges, but if you participate or at least pay attention, you'll do fine. He like when kids talk to him one-on-one and will help you if you need it. He hates late work, so always be on time. I did pretty well in this class because I listened to his instructions, as to what he wanted in a paper. ",1
"great prof. really shows that he cares about each individual, highly recommend!!!!",1
He works really hard to get us to understand the material and his tests conect everything to the real world. He's great!,1
"an earlier post said ""run for your life""  you can't, she is the only one teaching this class. she may be belittling if ask a question during office hours. This will be one of the instructors who will be in your ONE OF THE WORST lists. I think she found the WRONG occupation, but despite the years of Poor Student E-Vals, she has the same job?",0
"No assignments for 6 weeks, a couple of weeks with normal workload, and then suddenly slammed with oral exams and tests and compositions. Doesn't respect her students, seems to believe that any problems learning stem from them, not her teaching style. Says (in writing) that material won't be on a quiz and then it is. Worst prof I've ever had. AVOID",0
Not a nice teacher. Very rude and condescending. I felt like I was a bother to her if I had an issue. Not a people person at all. She was late to class on the first day.,0
"Gives boring lectures that dont really help. If you know Fourier you should be ok. Test 1 - OK, test 2 - BRUTAL, Final - ok. Exams are pretty bad. No one actually does well but the curve is insane",1
"Quiz every week (VERY EASY), midterm/final (VERY easy), 2 discussion posts, 1 group project/powerpoint. Group project is fairly easy, answer 8 questions in group of 6. He is an easy grader - meet the required word count and you will pass. Overall a very easy class. Do the simple work and get an A.",1
"She is very good at teaching, I have learned more about writing in her ENG100 class than I did during the entirety of high school. And she knows how to use zoom and canvas. A big portion of the grade is writing essays. Her class is challenging but not unreasonably so. Scheduling office hours with her is very easy and she is very helpful.",1
Terrible. Toughest pickiest grader ever. Terrible long boring lectures. Unfair in general. Takes 6 tries to say something. Babbles way too long ab irrelevant things. 0/10 avoid him if possible,0
LOVE LOVE LOVE him!! He is a great teacher and will help in whatever way possible!! I don't get algebra but he works with me lots in class till I get it! You will have a quiz everyday and you better NOT be late!! oh and don't talk in class to anyone but him!!But trust me if math's not your thing take him and you will learn lots!!,0
"Mr. Lloyd an excellent prof. The class itself is pretty easy... You watch movies. 3 Exams and 3 written film reports. The material on the exams is all gone over in class and he also provides a study guide. Actually watch the movies required for the film reports and spend some time writing them, you should do well. Great teacher & fun class!",1
Teaches at a graduate level although it was an undergraduate course (non-profit mngmt).  Course should have been taught very simply to get an idea of the non-profit world - instead class was put in groups to create our own non-profit organization from soup to nuts.  Excessive amounts of work and writing.  Very helpful but not quite as effective.,1
"I had a lot of good things to say about Russell, but they've been clouded by how she correlates eagerness to use quarantine productively with having all the time in the world. Course never had a set schedule (we don't know in advance what to read, when to meet, etc.) until 18 hours prior. Made life miserable & quarantine time even more uncertain.",0
"This was an online class that I wish I could have taken in person. It is clear she loves History and it is reflected in the materials. There is a lot of reading, but it is all extremely interesting. I have left this class with useful knowledge and a better understanding of the World. Do the work, put 100% in and you will receive an A, hands down.",1
"Very nice guy, I came to him when I had a problem with school work and my job. He was very understanding and helped me out. I did not get an easy A, but he worked with me so I could finish. Another one of my teachers wouldnt even answer my emails. Hes great you should take him. He loves history so much LOL!",1
Nothing you read or study in this class will help you on his tests. It's like he pulls his questions out of thin air. I am a straight A student and will probably have to drop this class because I currently have a D in it. Do not take this guy!,0
"The yoga sessions are great, but she pretty much just reads straight from the readings during lecture.",1
"He is a good guy but not the greatest professor. His lectures are very unclear and boring and it is very hard to understand him. He has a very strong accent. Although his class is easy and an easy A. Just go to class and you will pass the class. But be prepared to sit through long, boring and unclear lectures.",0
"Caprara is nice. I had never taken French before and it's all very basic things. Only 4 tests overall, not many grades. The work isn't too difficult",1
She is not clear on the homework assignments and when you ask questions it just becomes less understandable Also shes crazy about attendance. She is a good lady just not a good teacher.4 major assignments and mid term and final are take home & take 8-20 hrs its no joke. would not recommend. grades very hard and doesn't put up grade till weeks later,0
"Andrews is the man. Loved his class. Great professor, interesting, and not ridiculously hard and nit-picky like a lot of professors at this school.",1
"Talbert is a great lecturer. He takes a lot of Roman history and makes it very manageable for a semester. 6 short papers, 2 quizzes, 2 tests. Seems like a lot of work, but not if you keep up with names, map, progression of events as the class progresses. Grading is done mostly by TAs. Very detail -oriented tests and quizzes though. lecture heavy",1
"Not my cup of tea, graded negatively on discussion boards that did not align with her train of thought. I love to learn but being forced to see things one way is not learning. Not being able to share my thoughts on why I feel or believe a certain way was unfair. Glad it's over and never looking back.",0
He's a really nice guy but doesn't always seem to understand questions.  Homework is minimal.,1
"Was really hard in the beginning, and slowly start to not care? He let the students teach each other which isnt exactly helpful to every? but not really lecture like. The class seemed like a high school class...",0
"Great professor-- very clear in her explanations and really wants to make sure we all understand. She did impressions of certain disorders with us that gave a great visual and really helped to get the point across. If you don't take a class with her, you're really missing out!",1
"I took her online class and it was like we didn't even HAVE a teacher. She assigned the homework. Never really helped or returned emails. While she was teaching the class she graded maybe four assignments. (She just gave us all full points for turning them in.) Unless you like to learn straight from the book, don't take her; she's an awful teacher.",0
"Unfortunately, he is not great at teaching, gives a lot of homework, tests are very heavy, and overall would not take another class with this professor. Wish I knew how his teaching style was beforehand because then it would have saved me a lot of stress and worry.",0
"Brilliant to be sure, but very set in his own opinions.  Rough grader--never quite sure what he was looking for.  Will give you a unique outlook on literature though.  Tries to be really intimidating.",1
"HE IS A GREAT PROFFESROR, HE REALLY HELPS THE STUDENTS AND YOU WILL LEARN A LOT IN HIS CLASS, HIS CLASS IS NOT EASY BUT IS NOT THAT HARD YOU JUST HAVE TO TO DO THE WORK ALSO HE GIVES YOU THOUSANDS OF EXTRA CREDIT OPPORTUNITIES TO RAISE YOUR GRADE",1
"Tisha Irwin has been a great inspiration to me. Before I thought a being a professor would be hard, but after experiencing this class, this isn't the case.  All I have to do is lecture for 20 minutes, give out 2 pieces of paper and sit at my  4 2 hours computer. There's no point in answering any question. All i have to do is be rude and condasendng",0
"Professor Mizell is a very nice lady. But she doesn't teach AT ALL in class, all she does is talk about current events. She hardly ever replies to your emails when you need her to. She does make a good syllabus that is clear and easy to follow. Overall, she's nice but not a very good teacher.",0
"Julie gaudet is an awful teacher. She makes the minimal effort required, and I cannot even call it teaching. I had her for a research course. The course was so poorly put together, and Julie did not help. Any questions asked by students she would say ""it's in the textbook"". Her required readings for lessons did not match what she gives on exams.",0
Did not like her as a teacher,0
"One of my best prof I've had in a long time, she spends lot of time with you if you need it, one of the most dedicated professors i've met in a long time.  This class is by far one of my favorites",1
"Well-structured syllabus, doesn't respond well when contacted, poor grader, gives generic or little to no feedback on papers even when asked, at least 3 quizzes a week, supplies all of the readings aside from 1 book and movies (around $60 if rented), no extra-credit, strict deadlines (no exceptions even for work or emergencies), harsh late penalty.",0
"He doesn't teach the material; he expects you to learn on your own. Wastes valuable class time telling personal stories having nothing to do with the subject, wasting my money. Need I say more?",0
"This is the worst Professor I have ever taken a class from. There is a quiz almost every single day and they are waited heavily in the class. The concepts he teaches are fairly easy concepts to understand, but then tests and quizzes are very challenging. The class averages on all the tests were around 15/30. Great guy, terrible professor.",0
"Prof Hulsey is amazing! Take her, take her, take her. She's emailed me back at midnight multiple times, which is so helpful considering I had her online due to the pandemic. Accounting is such a difficult intro class and she really helped. I think she bumped my grade up like 5 points so I'd get an A, but I'm not positive about that. Take her!!",1
"Alicia is very pasionate and funny, her jokes will make you laugh but the summer course for span149 is a pain.  Too much to learn for 100 level course and the quizzes is hard to get a good grade.  Not a course to boost your grade at all.",0
"Loved Darwin. Great teacher. Very helpful. Three tests, four group projects, one paper/presentation. Easy and straight forward. Go to class and you will do well.",1
"Dr. Hansen is a great teacher! He understands that a lot of different kinds of people may be taking an intro-level PWS class, so he tries to make it applicable and interesting to everyone. He has a passion for soil and helps students get excited about it. A very reasonable teacher, and it's not hard to do well in his class.",1
"Be sure you use APA formatting, even for answering book questions.  Directions aren't very clear, so you are left guessing a lot.  Does not grade quickly.",1
Very nice professor! He definately knows his stuff! Pay attention in class and do all assignments and you should be fine.,1
Just really boring. Her voice is really shrill and she says the same stuff over and over. There wasn't really any structure to the class and all you need to do is read the book. ,0
"Rammaha is an amazing person, just a very tough professor. He lets you know ahead of time what section the quizzes are over so take advantage and do practice problems from your book or you won't pass! You are only graded on quizzes, exams (3), and the final. He lets you drop a few quizzes if you need to miss class.",1
"Interesting, melodramatic and engaging. I always looked forward to her lectures. Anything beyond that I say no! You better write a polished essay to get a high grade in that class otherwise you'll end up with a lower grade.",1
My perception of the HSIM program starting to change once because of this class.  I believe it was Dr. Kulesher's first time teaching this course but it was absolutely horrible! I can't recall learning anything except from the two 60 min videos we watched.  He also assigned us a 20 pg research paper and this is not a WI class.,0
"So bad, this guy doesnt know how to teach. Talks over you, when you try and ask questions he just talks right over you so you cant finish your sentence. Terrible teacher, not a real professor by any means.",0
"Love her. This is an easy Oral Comm. credit. Take the class if only to listen to her speak - oh, Garneau's voice. It's wonderful. She's a good prof, and her knowledge base is very deep in the general European language area. She is also a character, and has a great way of incorporating real life into what could be a monotonous class.",1
She is by far my favorite teacher here at STAC. She's so passionate about English and seeing her students do well. She is such an amazing professor that I am taking her again next semester. She makes hard topics more bearable. YOU MUST USE THE TEXTBOOK FOR THIS CLASS!!,1
He doesnt understand what the average person already knows. Bio 101 means you have to explain concepts like DNA and cell division. He expects you to be familiar with concepts without teaching them first.,0
"Prof. Tewari is great! I found Physics 2 much harder than 1, but she makes it bearable. Be prepared for pop quizzes or being unexpectedly called on, probably by name, and sometimes she doesn't pace her lectures perfectly. However, she explains concepts well and gives extra credit opportunities, plus she brings cookies to exams!",1
This class is fairly easy but the professor doesn't make the topic as interesting. I came in thinking that it would be an interesting class but no.  Don't have to read because he will lecture the reading in class and the whole class is based off the reading.  He is a very nice professor though.  Group members are assigned to you for final project.,1
"It's hard to pay attention but try. Generate class discussion amongst your peers, otherwise it'll feel like you're being strung out and left to die of awkward boredom.",0
"He uses Wiley for his class but he does not teach us anything because in every class, he just writes the homework on the board and does not explain the reasoning behind it. Sorry, but not for me, especially that this information will be on the CPA and I gotta teach myself all of it.",0
I recommend not taking her.,0
"great teacher, great adjuster, Best Gonstead...",1
"Falola is great! His lectures are normally very engaging and insightful (and often hilarious), but they can get a little boring. Your grade will also depend on your papers (not his lectures), but attendance is mandatory, so you might as well listen to what he has to say -- you will be entertained most of the time! Write good papers for an easy A.",1
"This is a horrible professor. Please stay away. He doesn't know how to teach, he is hard to understand.He seems like a nice person, but teaching isn't his thing. His handwriting is very sloppy. He doesn't use any technology besides an overhead projector which is useless.He goes off on a rant when u ask him a question and makes you look stupid.",0
"To be honest I am international students, I dont know anything about democracy or politics in United States, but I did get an A in this class. If I can do it, you probably can do it! Come to class, study key terms, as long as you come to class and take note, youll be fine. If you get bad grade it just because you didnt study for the test.",1
"Dr. Hoffman was a great  intro biochem professor! He makes the material really manageable and easy to follow. If you go to class, read/skim the book, and do the practice questions that he posts online, you will be fine!",1
"She was really funny and nice in class, but a super tough grader. If you didn't say something at least 3 times or more in class, then she would take points off your participation grade. Never could get full points on an assignment, she would always find something wrong with it.",0
"Professor was very unorganized. Syllabus was changed but not updated, so class didnt know when anything was due or what was expected of assignments because she changes them without notifying the class. Very hard to contact. Does not use e-mail often. Lots of reading, long lectures where she gets distracted and talks of everything but the material.",0
"She was very helpful. The class also isn't a lot of work; there is just a small homework assignment after every lesson, 4 quizzes and exams, and the final exam. Overall, it isn't a hard class as long as you ask for help if you need it. She is very clear on what she wants and will help you with anything. ",1
"Absolutely amazing coursework with a professor who truly cares about his students and how they connect with the content. Would absolutely take his class again. If you fail, it is on you. He gives a lot of time for asking questions and drops lowest test and essay grade",1
I HIGHLY DONT RECOMMEND him!!! DONT LISTEN TO THESE THEY ARE WRITTEN BY HIM,0
"Cool professor who cracks dorkish computer science jokes and teaches pretty well. Taught CS70 with Vazirani and took the backseat, but involved with tests and homeworks.. sometimes questionable practices of finding questions online and assigning them without knowing the answers.",1
"She can be a difficult grader but overall, this class was pretty easy to pass and still learn a lot. There is a lot of weekly work even though it is an online class so get ready to read and write a LOT more than you do in other classes. You also have to do a research paper which is more like a short 4 page informal paper than anything else.",1
"Honestly, the only thing that really killed me was the final. There was so much information to study it was unrealistic. The teacher seemed really nice, though It was an online class so it's hard to really tell. But yeah, there's a lot of reading and a lot of information. Don't think I would recommend it.",0
"Overall he is a good lecturer, however when it comes to the test, if you dont study the notes you take in the class youre going to fail. He makes the test hard and grades the few assignments by accuracy. The quizzes were the only easy thing from the class. I wouldnt recommend to take him you dont want to be challenged or stressed.",1
Professor Sankara is a good guy. He's definitely an intellectual and is very invested in your learning the material. He tries very hard and so long as you try hard too you should be fine.,1
"Death by powerpoint, dull class.  Takes too long to grade assignments, little to no instructions on divisional participation, very nit picky when grading, takes off too many points on assignments, the in class final scenario is ridiculously difficult. Most students didn't finish the final in time. You'll be lucky if you end up with a B average.",0
Extremely rude and doesn't help you if you ask. Tells you that you did an assignment wrong without telling you specifically what you missed.,0
"She is wonderful! Very helpful..and wants you to learn & understand the material. Her night class is real fun! All Bio tests are hard, if you stay on top of it & do the work your suppose to, you'll be fine. She's really nice & has a great sense of humor! I highly recommend her.",1
I would take one of his classes again in a heartbeat if it pertained to my major. His lectures are easy to listen to because of how funny he is. I had trouble with the multiple choices on tests sometimes but always did well on the essay portion. Hardly any homework- just reading articles from time to time. Definitely a class for the logic-minded.,1
Very good class.,1
Erickson might be the best bio professor I've had. His lectures make a lot of sense and I actually feel like I understand the core concepts of molecular biology now. The material is hard but the final is easy and you should easily do well if you study. Make sure you take advantage of his lectures and actually learn the stuff. Great professor!,1
"Dr. Brown is one of the worst professors NC State has to offer. His lectures are absolutely useless in which he emphasizes stuff that does not matter I would extend a whole semester than to take a class with him again If you are unfortunate enough to take him, I would suggest treating the class as an online class and learn the concept from YouTube.",0
Don't take this class! He doesn't teach a thing in the lectures but once a week he'll have one where he acts like he taught everything and no one has any clue whats going on! His tests and lectures are like two completely different classes. The first midterm the class average was 44%!!!,0
"If you can help it, don't take her for an online course. She is very hard to get in touch with, especially via email. Grades were posted timely the first few weeks of class, then she just stopped giving feedback, posting grades, and responding to emails until the last day of class. It's hard to improve if you don't know how you're doing in class.",0
"Possibly the worst class ive ever had. From the beginning of the semester, the entire class had to spend countless hours at the math lab.  If you have trouble with math STEER CLEAR. Dont get me wrong, professor is a nice guy, his teaching is horrible.",0
AWESOME. Fantastic prof. Best of the best. A real challenge for the grey matter,1
"She's a great french teacher. I came into the class planning on fulfilling the requirement, and now I'm seriously considering minoring in french. Not too much work, and the class discussions are usually very interesting!",1
"Horrible Professor. Mid terms are too hard, he doesnt care about the students and Comes late every week. Its a pain when the class is mandatory and you are still satanding in the hall for over 45 mins since he is late.",0
"Prof. Bannow is not a mean guy, let me get that out of the way. However, he talks down to students because he doesn't understand that a student doesn't master a concept by seeing it once. Do not ask questions, do not miss class, basically teach yourself. He ends up giving so much extra credit the class seems pointless. Not recommended at all.",0
Prof Burd is a wonderful professor. She really takes her time to make sure that her students know the material and is always willing to help. Highly recommend professor Burd.,1
"Seems like someone had a bone to pick a few years ago- I am with the other reviewer from 17- Professor Ausili works hard to make a long class interesting- he knows everybody, you do real time practice and you get positive reviews of your work. I put down he's an easy grader- he's not-- you have work --but there's no final and EVERYTHING's important",1
Tries to cover way too much within the 75min class. having the homework & quizzes online makes it very difficult to keep up with assignments because she gives no reminders of due dates. she is a very nice lady but a horrible teacher... would definitely NOT recommend!,0
Dr. Kelley is a great professor that actually gives you useful information about nutrition. Just make sure you submit all your assignments and take advantage of all the extra credit opportunities given.,1
"I've taken several classes with Katey and liked every one. She connects material to life and clearly wants us to understand and do well. I think her lectures are interesting most of the time and she's pretty funny. Her tests can be tough sometimes, but if you go to class, pay attention, and study a bit, you'll be ok.",1
She is often unprepared for class and none of her directions are clear. She expects you to know things without telling you. She literally makes no sense.,0
Rude. Disrespectful in any and all messages/class announcements. Doesnt offer help only offers vague responses to in depth questions.,0
"She is a great person but a bad professor! She calls on the same people over and over but fails to call on those who haven't been called on yet! She leaves NO COMMENT on the papers. Seems like she is not enjoying the class / students. Not helpful AT ALL! If you want to learn + pass this class, DO NOT take it with her .",0
Extremely interesting class and caring teacher. Network administration is a very useful course to learn the necessary skills for the employment market which allowed me to earn an industry Network Pro certification. Syllabus seems exceedingly demanding at first but when I started doing the assignments they were a lot easier than I thought initially.,1
"This professor is definitely one of my faves so far at CSUDH. He is very clear in his instructions and helps you when asked. He gives a step to step demonstration on the different art assignments which makes it easier. There is a lot of work! And I mean ALOT. So don't expect this just to be an easy A. Overall, I loved this class!",1
"great teacher. very much a techie. he doesn't teach by the book, but gives real world experience in C++/Java. gives review sheet for test. study review sheet and you'll be fine. doesn't really care if you turn in homework late. however, he does want homework done perfectly. very attentive with students.",1
"Really cares for his students and will go the extra mile for anyone of his students. He's hilarious and makes you think about things from a whole new perspective. He expects you to do quality work and actually tries to help improve your writing skills. Do yourself a favor and take his class. Great professor, even better person. ",1
"Save yourself & don't do it. The first time he said, ""I forgot how to do this, let me look it up..."" I stopped goes to class, as did everyone else. Boring, extremely hard tests. Read high school calc notes if possible, less confusing that him.",0
"Dr. Meadows treats this course like its a 400 level class. She also happens to be very rude, as others have commented on here. Avoid at all costs.",0
"Although she is really entertaining, she chats too much about random things and not so much about learning French itself. You'll get a good grade for doing the bare minimum, but you won't be learning much French.",0
"Plant evolution and diversity. Very hard course. Online lecture quizzes after each class and labs. Grades hard. Difficult to understand. When you ask for him to clarify or ask him any question, he does everything but help you. It's like you can't get a straight answer out of him. Very difficult to learn anything.",0
Best math teacher everrr!!! Def. take her for ALL math classes if you can.,1
She has powerpoints to present everyday but every slide is a stock picture with a title. Class is VERY awkward and uncomfortable. She is also very one sided and liberal in her material and it is hard to discuss opposing viewpoints. Towards the end of the class she got very hostile and would rush through the class. Made me rethink my major.,0
This teacher isn't the best teacher to take a class with. He has a very thick accent that you can't understand what he's saying at all. He does however doesn't give you a lot of homework but you won't understand how he grades. You have to purchase his book that he made because there's a code in the book to access your homework and it's hard to read,0
Definitely going to choose Prof. Looney's class again! Interesting class and easy A. You can bring notes to exams so you don't need to remember a lot. Lots of bonus points available and the observatory sessions are awesome!,1
Dr. Peruyera is by far one of the best professors I've had in Miami-Dade. He is very clear when teaching and gives a lot of life examples that help you with your tests. He truly cares about his students and will go out of his way to help his students succeed in his class. I truly recommend him.,1
HORRIBLE TEACHER!!!!,0
"I'd have a beer with him outside of the classroom but I won't be taking his comp 2 class... Attendance may not be ""mandatory"" but your notebook will be graded down if you miss a class period. ( even if you copy in the notes from the day you missed before he grades the notebooks) .",0
"If you are not ready to read more than a 1000 pages of textbook notes, do not take this class... The exams are ridiculously detailed and are not adjusted to the average grade (the average on the first midterm was a C). Discussion tends to be useless and the slides from lecture contain barely any information. Her teaching style just doesn't work.",0
Dr. Holt is extremely easy.  All you have to do is 15 assignments all year and take open book exams.  The assignments consist of you typing some numbers straight from the book and sending them to him over the internet.  Extremely easy.,1
"GET OUT WHILE YOU CAN!!! Wasinger does NOT care whether you pass or fail and doesn't care about you as a student/person. If you have to take her, my best advise is to record ALL of her lectures and listen to them over and over again and use the textbook for anything you don't understand.",0
"Please do yourself a favor and do not take a class from this guy. Unless youve already taken the class you wont understand a thing. The lectures are clear enough, but he goes off on long tangents about unnecessary problems. Outside of the lecture, you will be completely lost. Tests are nigh impossible, and quizzes contribute way too much. Dont.",0
"I don't recommend taking this professor. Doesn't grade fairly (makes mistakes in grading and gets mad when we ask for points back), very defensive, condescending to students, no one wants to ask questions because she always answers rudely. We leave feeling discouraged. We had a full class and everyone dropped out except maybe 8 of us. Lucky them.",0
He made Econ bearable and always offers help. Extra credit given after exams and he curves. Group project was not that difficult. Come to class to earn participation. Study guides helps exams. Overall Professor is super understanding if you show effort and he gives a lot of help and is lenient if he sees you trying! Recommend,1
"Online class is dreadful. She has no concept of design and should not be labeled as such. Does not give you the freedom to make an up to date website. Instead, she insists that your site be straight from the 90's. Class is unorganized. Rude when helping. Thinks you should already know. First web class was ok. This one is not.",0
Awesome professor. Highly recommend her for COMSTD-2. The group projects were really fun and she gives you a lot of feedback to help you be more comfortable speaking in public.,1
Be prepared to teach yourself everything or get a tutor. When you ask to get help on a question he will not help you and look at you like you should know everything. He doesn't give you credit for any homework if you miss the class period they checked it in no matter the circumstances.,0
"Great teacher. Made class interesting and seem a lot shorter than what it really was. Don't come in late, and don't expect an easy A. However, if you study and attend class you will do fine, and learn a good deal of information.",1
"First off, HORRIBLE professor. Don't even take him at all. Avoid at all costs. Don't expect to make up or re-take a test if you fail. Theres no chance of improving your grade. I have an A on all the homework because I dedicate my time, yet I am still failing.  Tests are not even as close as to the study guides. This is CALCULUS. It is a hard class!",0
"Difficult but effective teacher.  If I had to describe her in one word it would be, ""irregardless.""",1
Amazing professor. Would take his class again.,1
very unprepared  and doesnot no how to teach he maybe very knowledgeable on the subject but doesn't know how to give us knowledge on the subject,0
"I mean.. i thought she is very easy at first because i took her class before and then i passed easily. However, if you slack, you can fail. Because she gives you very confusing feedback on your paper. She always says your creative ideas are really good but, she can fail you on very end of the papers.",0
"Hands-down the worst professor I have ever had. He rambles every class, never following the syllabus. He is a really tough grader and is unwilling to discuss his grading techniques/reasons for giving you the grade he gives. If attendance wasnt absolutely mandatory I would never go because he is very disrespectful and talks down to students.",0
"Dr. Streit  says ""No extra credit, No exceptions."" When our class of 200 took her final exam, not one person made an A, the highest grade was an 86. The class average for our final was a 59, and she was not even in the United States the week before, or the week of finals. The class was too difficult, considering it was for non science majors.",0
"Dr. Tavss has a special place in my heart. He loves chemistry as much as he loves teaching, and will go the extra mile for his students. To do well, read the textbook, his notes, and complete all of his problem packets. Do attend his office hours as well; he is very insightful and has more time to break down the material further.",1
"Anyone who says he's a good lecturer, must have had a different prof. He's boring, condescending and vague about things like what's on the exam for no reason. He never recorded his lecture for no reason and never wanted to help us in any way. Snobby and pompous",0
"A lazy professor who came late, chatted with students about anything but the class for 20 minutes, and winged it the for the rest of the period. He also failed to get in recommendations for students applying for fellowships. Disappointment.",0
"Her style of teaching is kind of scattered, so she's hard to follow at times. and she's very lecture heavy. But she's very knowledgeable and very sweet and the class itself is very interesting. Make sure to read the syllabus and keep track of assignment due dates!!",0
"Professor Birnbaum is a interesting teacher. He is unorganized with his lectures and grading. All over the place. IF you ask a question he will make you feel incompetent. tests are ridiculous, the study guide barely helps. I would advise taking this class with a different teacher. he ruined my experience of forensics :(",0
"Great teacher but, his lectures/test reviews don't line up with the test. You will always have 2 tests every night you have a test excluding the first one. He's willing to work with you and offer extra credit if you're struggling but if you're like me and got over a 100% in your previous class, you should not take this professor.",1
"I think Prof. Lane knows what she's doing. I shouldn't have taken it as a summer course because she has 8-10 assignments due on Sunday. I had a good average, and then the 1 time test dropped me down a letter grade after being at a 96% for 4 units. I'd recommend for fall instead of summer.",1
"Had to drop this class bc after a 51% average on the midterm, he refused to curve and would not help ANYONE. I know like 16 other people who dropped. Material would've been fine with some sympathy and help. He's so unclear",0
"This professor is a very hard grader, points are taken off tests because of not writing parenthesis, or an equal sign. He is very disrespectful, the very first day of school he told us he was only trying to help and that we could look at him as our favorite grandpa, three weeks later he refused to answer questions. PLEASE DON'T TAKE HIM!!",0
"I'll put it simply: avoid at all costs. I don't like being critical of teachers cause I can't imagine it's a very easy job, but this was the worst class I've ever taken. It's probably due to the fact that we've transitioned online, but he has an aid & it's been almost a year now - it should have been better organized. Just don't do it.",0
"Dr. Newman refuses to lecture for her students.  It is infuriating when she asks for feedback on her teaching and says, ""do not write down to lecture more because I will not do it.""  Every class you read some paper of Cystic Fibrosis from 30 years ago.  That is about the whole class.  You split into groups for most of the class and talk about CF.",0
I agree that this page doesnt justify the truths of this professor. I feel like his papers are vague and he doesnt fully explain to students what is expected of them. He is a really tough grader and does not help you increase your grade.,0
"Sandoval is a good teacher. I dont know why so many people are complaining. What other professor cancels class so he can meet individually with his students and explain to you while he grades your essay?! He lays exactly what he wants you to write and how he wants it done. His lectures are redundant, but the class is very easy if you can write.",1
"Dr. B is extremely passionate about what she teaches. She in knowledge about environmental science and that shows through her lectures. All of the texts are hand written but that only makes you study harder so you actually can recall the material youve learned. If youre passionate about environmental science, youll enjoy it!",1
Very fair professor. I appreciated his simple weighted grading and his candid way of describing things. Very clear expectations and great test review. Made passing this class a breeze.,1
He is sweet,1
"It would have been a good class if she had given feedback. Grades were not posted - not in 48 hours, not in 3 weeks. Emails go unanswered, questions are left hanging. Even emailing several times doesn't help. It sounds as if she is a good teacher in the classroom, maybe. Online, not so much. I would not recommend anyone taking this class online.",0
I'm taking Dr Mukherjee for Calc 2 and he is one the worst professors I could ever have. Only 1 week left in this class. He doesn't offer to help students and never goes over homework or tests so you wont know what the answers are for exams. Blames students for not knowing certain material and he wont teach students. I'll never take him again��,0
"Devin Gandy is by far one of the most knowledgeable professors at Mcneese. He can be very comical in his lectures, but he covers a very broad amount of topics and is very knowledgeable in each one. Gandy is one of my favorite professors Ive ever taken at Mcneese. He does not post notes online, you must attend class.",1
"REGRET taking this class. Yes, she gives EC but that is because she knows a large chunk of her class will fail without it. The quizzes and tests are worded tricky and even if you study, do the review and read, her test questions aren't clear.",0
"I could say a ton of great things about professor Robinson! Out of all the science professors at HGTC she was by far the best. She was very clear, organized, and straight to the point . She made the material easy to understand and made it almost impossible to fail her class ! I usually get Cs in bio but passed her lab and lecture with As!!",1
"Tancredi is really chill and passionate about music. The essays are really easy, just make sure to take notes during class. Its hard not to like him, hes sarcastic and funny.",1
"Really hard class, tested on way too much material, but really good lecturer and wants students to do well, the material is just really dense and complex.",1
"Worst ever. Was super fair on all the midterms, but basically missed the last 2 weeks of class and didnt tech the new material and made the final extremely difficult and not at all like what she told us to expect. Totally unfair!",0
"Gail is amazing. After the experiences I had with her in lab, if I were sick and scared in the hospital, I would want her as my nurse. She is very candid, caring, and committed to her student's success. I was intimidated by her at first, but I truly cannot say enough good things about her. She is very accessible and helpful outside of class.",1
Super dry and boring lectures. Must go to lectures however because she does not post slides and will test the specifics from lecture and the readings. Know all of the definitions. Tons of reading.,0
"He tends to suck at times, but not always",0
"Took him for film and lit.  This guy is the greatest professor at nassau.  I would take any of his classes.  Truly passionate, understanding, helpful, and inspiring. If you think I'm overduing it, then you haven't had a hellish experience with a professor yet.  This guy is the man. Pronounce his name ""Dongello"" and he will love you for it.",1
"Honestly, this class was terrible. I did not understand anything and he went too fast to give me a chance to keep up. I do not recommend.",0
She's pretty great but her lectures can get boring. Her tests are pretty easy and she is super nice and cares about her students. Would recommend over other professors.,1
"I have taken multiple courses with Nancy and did well in all of them. Fair warning though, Nancy does not care about her students and has no interest in helping you succeed, even when you make an effort and/or are a good student. The classes are worthwhile, if you put in the work you will learn, but expect to do it without her support. ",0
GREAT professor!! Weekly discussion worth 10 pts and weekly assignment worth 20 pts.  Most assignments were completed in 30 minutes or less! 3 exams that are a bit longer in the form of 7-10 short essay questions.  Allows late work to be turned in for full credit!! I finished with a 98% overall so an easy A if you keep up with readings/work.  -n,1
"He has little knowledge of economics outside what he's read in the textbook that you use in class. He ""encourages"" discussion, but anything that doesn't fit into his narrow ideology is shot down. One day in class he made the claim that, and I quote, ""libertarian ideas of economics are the same thing as socialism"". I'll let that speak for itself.",0
"This class shouldn't be as hard as it is made. Exams are confusing and a few questions were incomprehensible on each one. To make it worse, no specifics are given as to what will be on the exam, just how many questions from each chapter will be on it.  If you have the time to do every single reading you can do well, but you won't be able to cruise.",0
Grading was very confusing throughout the semester. Lectures are hard to follow and typically go over class time. Lectures are also all powerpoints so it is easy to get bored. Most directions for assignments are not clearly stated and do not have a rubric to see what he is looking for. Would not recommend or retake a class with him again.,0
"Willing and wants to help.  I started the class with no interest, just needed it to transfer, but she was helpful when needed and her lectures are very helpful.",1
Beware of BUAD 246 recruitment and selection group project!  She is not clear on what she wants and if you have a problem she is no help. Also doesn't follow through with what she tells you or changes her mind the next day. Very tough marker.  ,0
"At first he replied to the emails fast, then the last time I sent him an email, he didn't reply, which cost me a grade. I don't know what to say about him, but I would never take him again.",0
"Proffesor Fosnaugh is an amazing algebra Proffesor! He is willing to take time out of his schedule to help you succeed in his class. He gives exam reviews that help you pass each exam. His lectures are good, just don't miss a class. He grades very generously. I would highly recommend taking him for college algebra, he is the best of the BEST!",1
Nice guy but his class discussions tend to be off topic 90% of the time.  Some of the videos that he showed had more to do with history/political science topics than english.  He also chooses a lot of political and history topics for the essays and term paper.  Grades hard on essays but the midterm and final are pretty easy.,1
"Intro to programming and problem solving. Midterm: 30% and final: 35%. Probably the toughest class to take. Assignments 20% but there's no help. There's no tutorial or anything, and book doesn't help. He expects you to figure out java coding by yourself. Lets just say if you have no idea about programming then you will fail.",0
"Best professor ever. I would recommend to take her for 123 A,B and c. She doesn't make lecture boring. Its very important to do the lab and homework, trust me it boost your grade. She gives practice test so you know what to expect on the test. If you don't understand some problems she is more gladly to help you out.  ",1
"Professor Searfoss comes into class expecting the students to lead the entire thing for an hour and 15 minutes. Instead of teaching or asking provoking questions, it almost seems like she is so bored that she could care less about planning out a thoughtful class discussion. Prepare to read a lot and talk about what you read every class period.",0
This is my second time taking math 222 and he really helped me understand the the criteria and make connections on how everything is basically related. this is something other math teacher were never able to do. he helped me see math in a simpler way.,1
I took this class in 2020 and I don't know if it was just the circumstances but this class was lacking structure and presence. Lectures were hard to sit through sometimes but it was an easy pass. If you are looking for surface level insight into the field consider this class.,0
"This is a fun class but you do have to do a lot of reading. She only gives out 2 tests, 2 essays, and a project (but reading the chapters are crucial). She is a very nice person and wants to see you pass the class.",1
"Ms. Parker's class was interesting. Not an art fan. Even though this was an online class I still had a ""field trip"" to our local museum (did cost a fee). Which was pretty cool since I had never been. Very fair grader, made a ""B"" due to me not checking my blackboard after I submitted my last assignment. Easy ""A"" if you do the work.",1
Awesome teacher. I wished he taught more classes.,1
"He's okay. Lots of work and lots of extra credit. He seems like an easy A, but his disorganization can really hamper your grade. You also won't learn much with him. He can be inappropriate as well. I'm pretty sure there are better options at MAR 3023.",0
if that was psychlogy then i'm glad it wasnt my major...another bad class at PBU...all he did was preach every class and show movies...,0
"This class was so incredibly confusing. She explained things in a very unclear manner, even my TA said that she was confusing.",0
She is an amazing prof!! She is so energetic and passionate about teaching!,1
"Wow. I don't think I have ever hated a class so much. I dread going to this class every single day. Pearson is a nice lady, and she means well. But she has no idea what she is talking about half of the time. She will assign an essay and be confused on what she assigned. Do not take this teacher.",0
"Dr. Anderson is an awesome person and professor. His class grades are based on a rank system, so it's basically a competition with you and your classmates. His tests are extremely difficult. He is very knowledgeable and just a great guy. The scientific paper for lab is very difficult, but I learned so much in this course.",1
"So this class is definitely challenging. You need to study a little more than just following along with the HTML tutorials for the tests. If you email her though and ask to see if your website is correct & working, she will respond quickly and tell you what is wrong and how exactly to fix it.",1
"A remarkable lecturer and person, easy to approach, breaks out into song during lecture & class and makes things fun/interesting. Don't get me wrong you'll work hard, ie: loads of HW, labs & tests are hard. But worth it! especially if you are a bio major. After this class you'll have strong foundational knowledge in all things cell/molec Bio",1
"He is a professor full of enthusiasm, who cares a lot about all his students. He makes auditing, which is a very hard course, not that hard. Take his class or you will regret.",1
"Dr. Mescioglu is an excellent teacher who is very knowledgable in mathematics. Also is the easiest teacher ever! I took him for Finite, Decision Science, and Systems and they were all easy classes that I learned a lot in! Highly Recommend!",1
Like this guy,1
"The way homework is setup is awful, if you get a question right then try another one for practice it take's away from your hw grade. The hw also is graded week of unlike better professors that let it all be open till the end of the course. Instead of using the regular software for test he make's you use zoom so he can watch you which is odd.",0
"I love Mr. Ariail!!! I took his capstone class for my Associates Degree. Great way to finish off the semesters at TCC. He offers a great business simulation that is really fun. He, himself, is very fun and comfortable. I took his class Saturday mornings for 3 hours and looked forward to each one!",1
Very confusing on what she wanted on papers and was not very helpful. The only positive thing was the work load itself was easy. But she was way to picky on grading.,0
hard grader,1
"At first, I thought I liked Professor Nelson. Her lectures were good and easy to follow. But then when it came to the paper, an article review, she wouldn't listen to criticism about the rubric and didn't post a sample of what the paper should look like until the week before it was due.",0
Dr. Feige is the best professor i've ever had. He wants us to be successful and cares about our scores. His powerpoints are okay but he explains everything in full detail. So go to class. He teaches a very hard class that prepares us for the nursing program.,1
"This course is so heavily dependent on the text it's not even funny. The lectures are long, tediously boring, and ultimately useless as they do little more than summarize the text. The midterm was easy, but people stopped showing up to class after that and he purposely made the final hard to screw everyone over! My mark dropped almost 10%",0
I really feel like the entire course was very unfair. I would not recommend it to anyone under any circumstance.,0
Hands down one of the worst professors at the University of Hartford. He never responds to students asking for help and will take points off your grade for any stupid little thing. He is out to get students and if he doesn't have a good feeling about you from day one drop the class because you don't have a chance at passing.,0
"ENG49 with Professor Gonzalez is an extremely fun class - his lighthearted manner combined with his extensive knowledge and care for his students makes this class one you won't want to miss. English is not my strong suit, but he is always available to discuss problem areas and gives great feedback on how to improve. I highly recommend him.",1
"Best advisor ever! His class was really awesome. It made you think and challenged you, but not in that mind-rape sort of way.",1
"I really enjoyed this class and learned a lot from her, she does quick writes everyday which is very nice to talk about what were learning. Midterm and exams were easy because she reviews and gives study guides. Does a few group work, but gives good feedback on papers like play critiques. Required to see both of the plays they're performing at COC",1
"This was my third English class with him. He's a funny, nice guy though he may not seem like it at first. If you don't understand something, just ask, he's more than willing to help! Expect to read and then write journals with quotes based on what you read. Go to class, do the homework and you'll pass. I greatly enjoyed the novels!",1
"A great professor is very easy. I took her online very easy A. she gives lots of extra credit, but the work is a lot. she is one of the best online professors, but there was too much work but you can handle it. take her trust me you won't regret it.",1
I learned a lot from her and she is the best english professor a student could have. She tells you exactly what she wants from you. Great professor.,1
Tim will do whatever he can to help his students succeed.  Very dedicated and his comunication is great.  He's even called me at home when I needed to speak with him.  Very rare for instructors.  Take his class if you get a chance you won't regret it.,1
"Asked for the time limit on a quiz and was told ""Can't you shut up? You have diarrhea of the mouth."" Never gave the time limit and less than half the class finished. Students treated so bad one walked out. Only told give ""links to articles and maps,"" but if you gave a link instead of copying and pasting a map into the paper, you failed the project.",0
"I POSTED TO HER IN AN EMAIL FOR FALL 2010 SEM CLASS  FINAL GRADE                  I need to ask you a question; I noticed my grade was a B in the class, with a pt total of 1015. I am very happy about it, but?.  According to the syllabus grading system a pt total of 852-958 would qualify as a B in the course.  As I mentioned I have 1015 pts.  That w",0
"She was a great professor. i took her my sophmore year, and i will say that her class was NOT easy but if you go to her she will help you. If she sees you trying then she will not give up on you. She Curves all of her test. I failed all of her test but 1 before the curve and i still got an A out of her class. TAKE her but be prepared to work.",1
A really good professor! Is always available to help if you need it. took multiple spanish classes with her.,1
"He over explains simple economics topics and equations. His first lecture he said ""I've been teaching for 15 years so I know what I'm doing."" It's pretty condescending to students.",0
"Not only did I think I would dread public speaking but at 7:30 am on Monday which is my one day off?  However, I will say I am so glad I took his class. I rarely looked at the time in his class because he made it interesting to be there. He allows you to pick your speech topics, making the possibilities endless. Mr. Carter really inspired me!",1
"Awesome guy, quite the character, clearly loves teaching and extremely passionate. If hes teaching you anything about anthropology your in for a treat.",1
difficult to stay awake during lecture. but he is super nice and flexible.,1
"You MUST do the homework to understand the course material and to be prepared for the exams. His YouTube lectures are gold! For the exams, bring every page of his notes, and bring your homework. If you do this, you will get an A. Attend EVERY class or you will not understand the difficult topics. Start your group project early! This class was dope.",1
"Not helpful, only class I have ever failed, I got migraines because of this class! Awful! ",0
She is such a great professor. She literally explains every detail in her class. She is very energetic and confident and she gives people a feeling that she knows what she is saying to her students. She is also helpful and you can meet her during office hours and she is happy to answer your questions.,1
"Science is my worst subject, but she has a way of explaining things that I didn't understand before!",1
"Very unclear on expectations and takes forever to grade things. By the time she tells you that you did something incorrectly, you've already turned 2 other assignments in. Acts in person like she is laid back and an easy going instructor but she's not. She's very picky and will pick you apart.",0
just don't do it,0
"She really is a great teacher. Shes hard but she prepares you well for nclex as well as the real world. In the real world not everyone is bubbly and nice all the time. Shes very real and doesnt care if you like her or not, shes there to teach nursing and thats what she does. But dont piss her off! Shes a great person and teacher.",1
Prof Sigal is great. He's far from the stereotypically boring history prof. He really encourages you to be creative which is refreshing. I took his course on colonial Latin America and enjoyed it a lot. Whether you're taking a course in history to fulfill a general req or for your major I definitely recommend him.,1
"Your grade is based on 4 exams alone, doesn't collect homework, give extra credit, or even collect or grade quiz's. There's no room for improvement if you do not do well on all of the exams. He doesn't use MyAccountingLab online but it is there for reference, more than half the students in the class aren't aware of it and neither is he. ",0
Professor Cain is terrible at explaining what exactly she wants in her papers and assignments. She weights the final paper the heaviest and does not give options on making it up. Thus you may be an A student but because the final is worth 350 if you do poorly on it you'll end up with a C. Its ridiculous. She often has an unpleasant attitude aslo.,0
"Hegner is really more than what I had expected after checking rate on this site. She makes class very easy and interesting, let us go early (almost 30 minutes everyday).  I wanted to take her again, but she is not gonna teach ACCT 311.  I can say that who do not learn from this class, cannot learn ever.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED professor.",1
"Very good proffesor, I totally understood her and very helpful. I recomend you take her classes. I had a very good experience with her and if you try to attend classes and be active you will get what you want. Easy to talk to and an open minded person for many problems.",1
"A nice guy but not a great professor. Exams were hard, not enough time, made up 85% of grade, you needed to remember EVERY topic he taught in class. His bad microphone made lectures hard to listen to. Idk the other Econ 302 professors, he was good not great. Dropped lowest midterm grade, HW was easy. He was nice to give a 1% curve at semester end.",0
"Prof. Moss is a funny guy & the class is easy. Only three tests are taken during the year and he drops the lowest score @ the end of the quarter. MAKE SURE YOU GO TO CLASS. My grade went from an 84%-73% bc of it. Didn't realize how strict he was about it until end of course. Perfect grade on final presentation & essay, but still got a C.",1
"Professor Pave is, hands down, the best instructor at SBVC. His classes are interesting and you will receive daily instruction. He is encouraging and allows creativity and free thought. He responds to his email daily and I am sad that I have taken all of his classes that are available at Valley.",1
Literally worst experience of my life. Shouldve listened to people when they told me not to take him. I learned absolutely nothing in orgo,0
I have yet to get below a B in any college course or online course I have taken. Yet this class makes absolute no sense and doesn't give clear instructions at all. All I have to say if you take this class is GOOD LUCK,0
"lots of work, but you learn tons. grades papers really tough,and he likes daily pop quizzes on 40 pg. reading assignments; he's an officer who doesnt let the mids off easy",1
"Professor Crittenden is the one of best professors I've ever had. His lectures are very clear and the expectations are reasonable. At times it can be a bit boring, but what do you expect from Newtonian mechanics? He's very happy to talk with you outside of class and will answer any questions you have! Also he sounds a little bit like Carl Sagan.",1
"Prof Wade is highly experienced in network infrastructure and OS. Taken with Windows Server, an experience oriented course. Wade was able to provide guidance as needed, but perhaps does not emphasize importance of time needed outside class. WinServ is VERY lab heavy, strongly recommend using free lab time or working on labs on personal laptop",1
Horrible teacher...never returns any grades so you have NO idea how you are doing in the self-paced class! Talks low and very creepy,0
"You are not going to learn programming in his class. He only taught few algorithms but didn't do any coding in the class. Also, he only calls out girls names in class and make them solve the algorithms on board. He is unprofessional and his jokes are sometimes inappropriate. It's an easy A if you help him in his personal life problems.",0
"You have to work hard for the grade you get, it's tough work. But he is more than willing to help anyone that ask and will show you how to study for his test. Plus, he is damn sexy and funny. Makes his classes even better",1
"He's an excellent professor. This class is easy, but there is A LOT of work per assignment. If you just do what you're supposed to, you'll make a B easy. It is group heavy, so make sure you address any issues early.",1
"Monika was so disorganized. The course structure was all over the place and so last minute. 90% of students in French112 were taking for language requirements - we don't want to be doing presentations in French, we just want to pass the class! Terrible, UBC needs to reassess language requirements.. ",0
"Great teacher! Cares about his students and makes his lectures relatable and funny. Does not post notes so be ready to write every class start to finish. Gives 15 points for missing two or less classes, and 10 points for being a registered voter. Tests cover a lot of information, but if you study 2/3 nights before the test youll be fine.",1
Just avoid him.  Take the other professors who understand students and how they learn.,0
"Honestly, this professor has been my favorite along with the class. She is extremely understanding, smart, and funny which makes the class even more enjoyable! The class assignments are actually pretty simple and she does give opportunities for extra credit. I would highly recommend her class if you need to pass a sociology class.",1
"He did not read from the book at all in my class. Yes he uses powerpoint, which I found very helpful. The fact is he cannot make this subject as simple as some people would like it to be. Almost half of my class dropped, but that seems typical for HACC! All of the adults stayed.",1
He is incredibly disorganized. He shows up to class late 3-4 times a semester. He doesn't communicate with the people teaching recitations whatsoever. The exams are graded differently depending upon what section you're in ( F in one section  B in another section). At the end of the year no one respected him and he completely deserved it.,0
"Honestly, I am fairly confident that she wrote all of the positive reviews herself. I am an 'A' student, but I don't know anyone who would speak well of her. She is unclear in her expectations, terrible to communicate with, and doesn't understand student questions at all. I got a decent grade in the class, but I would seriously NEVER take it again.",0
"Maloy is a nice person who seems to mean well, but she cannot teach at all. Her exams are impossible. Sure, she curves, but if she was teaching properly she wouldn't need to. She doesn't update grades,ever. Still waiting on grades from 2 months ago :) she loves to give out homework but will not teach anything to help with said busy work. Enjoy :)",0
"Heed these warnings, for they are all true. She even stated in our class that she is not fond of teaching and no longer wants to do it. Doesn't answer emails. She does not give grading criteria for big projects, and then grades very hard. I even lost points for being ""too concise"" on a big project. Is that even possible?",0
"He would rant about random things that had nothing to do with class. He has his ""lunch bunch"" that is very creepy and unprofessional. Not a good professor but I did learn a lot from the class just from the readings. Never from his lectures.",0
"Everyone seems to like this professor but my whole class thinks she is a terrible teacher, she is redundant, boring, and condescending to some students, although she  knows less about certain things. Yes as a person she is sweet, as a professor she is horrible. Her projects are pointless, and she is not organized in her lessons.Keep away!",0
"Prof. Jalpal, knows his Marketing stuff, but he can't teach an introductory class.  Now if your at advanced marketing level than he's your man.  I can't support prof. that says, i don't get paid to provide solution to cases he uses in the class, and so won't handout his solutions.  Also, he has the class do 3 group presentations on same case/day",0
"This prof made me absolutely hate this class. She and our TA miscommunicate on everything. Get ready for the most unorganized class of your life. If you want to be spoken to like a toddler, take this class. Gets mad at people for being on zoom and not in class. Like sorry we're in a pandemic and I don't want to get corona? Extremely insensitive.",0
"Take a different professor. If you want to pass prepare to go to every single class to take quizzes, because according to her, her class ""has so much good information"". In reality, the class is made up of a plethora of rhetoric from academia. I worked very hard, and bit my tongue, then sighed a breathe of relief when the semester was over.",0
"Took the class online, and was pretty difficult. (70% homework, 2 exams 15% each) Required a lot of reading and a lot of homework assignments. Still, Mr.Monnin assisted a lot in the challenging homework and even curved the grades. Overall, a good professor that is recommended.",1
"I honestly think he has issues. Throughout the class he acts like youre doing well since we get good grades in exams, assignments and keeps on saying how he isnt here to fail anyone we will do well. And we all put so much efforts, but in the end ..... BOOM. You see your grade and its a b :) He messed everyones final grade up for no reason.",0
"He does not take many grades but if you go to class, take notes, and go off of his study guide you can easily get an A if you put forth an effort. LOVED THIS CLASS!!!",1
Good!,1
"Russell is awesome. The class was a little jumbled because it was her first time teaching it, but it wasn't that bad. Very little work and interesting discussion topics. Only criticism is that the TA grades papers and there's very little variance in grades regardless of quality--it's going to be a 90-92 regardless, which makes an A (96) difficult.",1
"Prof. Prussing knows her stuff. Yes lecture is boring, but she hands out 50% of your notes in class.Readings are interesting and incorporate well.Just want to say that her TA's DONT deserve to be in grad school, (this means you MANDY DICKERSON). They like to screw people like me that KNOW what they're talking about out of good grades.",1
This instructor was the best instructor I have had at NWACC hands down! She was very prompt about grading our discussion posts and gave great feedback! She was very engaged with us as students and with the material. Too bad you can't clone her.,1
"Terrible professor. Only professor that offers the management specific courses, and they're all online. I wanted to take in person. I know what you're thinking, online is easier right? Absolutely not. He makes them so hard in that he grades everything so tough. TONS OF WORK. Then he gives exams that are so hard and cover 4 chapters at once.",0
"Had a bit of a problem with this professor,  I am slated to walk across the stage and get my diploma in 5 days, and the man still has not graded any of our assignments....  I will give credit where it is due, he is very knowledgeable, and intelligent.  But a poor teacher, he slacks very hard and just curves the final exam and passes people.",0
"Horrible teacher! She doesn't know what she is doing or teaching. So confusing on what she wants to teach you, and the material that is on the tests are not what she tells you.",0
"AP is one of the best professors Ive ever had at Reynolds. She makes you work for your A bit if you show up to class, be involved, stay motivated and respect her the way shell respect you, youll get an easy A. Shes always willing to help and give feedback, she makes English class fun and hands on. Please take her while you can.",1
"Great prof! I enjoy his class, and humor. If you like the office and 24, you will get along great. Tests were moderately difficult, study hard and you do fine. I got an A.",1
Joanie is a nice instructor. She teaches the class well and will answer any questions you might have. She provides great feedback on papers and encourages you to want to do better.,1
Class is meant for students with disabilities so it goes a bit slow. It helped me decide what I wanted from school.  I learned study skills I did not know before. There are some fun excercizes. Do the workbook! He uses the workbook a lot!,1
"Dr. Chalk gives a ton of work constantly, and doesn't give you a single day off. She is under the impression that her class is the only class you are taking, and it is the most important. She gives random reading quizzes and picks awful books. She talks for 55 minutes about the books while you sit in boredom.",0
"Amazing professor, great at teaching!  Fun class with a lot of personal stories that make things very clear.  I learned a lot and would certainly take another class from this professor!",1
she is a very good professor.,1
"I understand both students and professors are having a hard time with COVID. But even now, this guy is still such a harsh grader and is still teaching religiously by the book, exceptions are very limited. Even if wifi is hard to come by, Zoom attendance required. Difficulty for exams and labs is ridiculous, pls cut some slack for your students.",0
"The professor gets very political in class and it's annoying. Too many readings, no laptops in class, you need the hard copy of the text. Lots of HW. Don't take this class when you have other important classes that take a lot of time because this professor seems to think she's the only professor we have.",0
"Learn from the book. Didn't buy the finance calculator. He doesn't know how to do the problems without it, so if you can't teach yourself. well good luck. Review is not helpful. He cannot give formulas or extra help unless it is directly from the slides given to him. Why pay for a class when the teacher can't teach?",0
Doug is a great teacher.  He is friendly and has really mastered teaching drawing. He helps you strive to be a better artist.,1
"Great Professor.  The material isn't earthshattering or really hard to understand, but expect to work hard.  The things you learn in this class will be of use to you throughout your life, whether you go into business or not.",1
"I am not great at math. Anytime a question was asked he would explain it in the same way, he wouldn't dumb it down. He said the gist and that was it, if you don't have a question right away he moves on. Pay close attention, be prepared to go to tutoring if you're not great at math.",0
"Easy, boring & useless",0
She is a  tough grader. I  won't take any class with her in future . She really wants that student get low grades. Pre Calc is  easy but she made it too hard.,0
"Take this class for your Cultural Heritage 1. Steve keeps discussion interesting and relevant. He is open to alternative viewpoints and everyone is made to feel like they have something to contribute. We don't just talk about the Greek and Romans, we talk about how it relates to today. Class is lots of fun> he's a fair grader and really nice guy.",1
This has been by far the most dumb class I've taken. He will talk and talk about absolutely nothing and miss stuff that is on the test. He's a good guy but honestly all the tests are terrible.,0
"I don't recommend her for first year students as she'll destroy your gpa with her hard tests and exams if you don't learn to adapt. If you're stuck with her, go to all her DGD's and PAY ATTENTION to all examples she does in class as it might save you during a test. Overall decent prof but expect to put in at least 20 (or more) hours a week for an A",0
"His exam for Hist 112 is basically summed up with the articles for discussion group, textbook reading and material from lectures. Fairly straightforward and relatively easy to understand.",1
This was an easy class. As long as you do the work you will make a good grade.,1
"I took Dr. Russum's courses until the school had to tell me, alright, you've capped on out Humanities. Take this professor. Appreciate the sources he gives you -- I still look at my notes from 5 years ago. Take this class if you're serious about the course itself. And when you do so, be prepared to learn and unlearn what you think you know.",1
"Prof Seymour is absolutely hilarious. Participation is key in this class & he creates an atmosphere which allows students to engage with each other about what we've learned. His lectures however, are not always clear & do not provide enough info to prepare for exams, googled info not allowed. He's wonderful, but his professionalism needs work.",1
Dr. Comfot is from the Chemical Engineering department. So his entire class is geared toward Chem E's. If you are another kind of Engineer you will not to well in his class at all. I highly recommend a different teacher if you are not a Chem E.,0
"Finishing up my degree at NOVA so I had to take him. He's by far the hardest Spanish professor I've ever had. Very strict/tough grader and assings a lot of homework! While he cares about his students, he could be very rude towards them during lectures. I normally did well in Spanish, but got a C with hard work. Glad I only had to take him once.",0
"By far the worst and most boring professor I have had here. The lectures drag on for hours and it's essentially a compilation of random facts barely stitched together. The two exams are made up from the books, and the notes in class are worthless and confusing. The lecture is mostly just rambling and videos. Do not take for an easy A.",0
Dr. Saunders is one of the best professors that I have ever had. He makes the content so much more easy to understand and is extremely helpful if you do not understand a topic. I would highly recommend taking Dr. Saunders!,1
one of the best mnsu teacher. i have learnt a lot from him.,1
Hasn't been relevant this century. He should have stayed retired and spared all of his students his unrealistic expectations and archaic thinking.,0
She is a great teacher. She taught me a lot about English and writing. She makes class interesting and fun.,1
"I am not good at English, and I got an A.  He is lenient with grading, no tests, just responses from stories in the textbook and essays.  The final is take-home.  Great class,  I'm a better writer because of this class.",1
"billy's a necessary evil because he's the only organic chem prof, he's an idiot, you can find his companion notes for the textbook online and he just reads them word for word, you'd be better off just reading the book and only showing u for tests, if you remember anything about gen chem 1, you're smarter than he is",0
Trust me. AVOID. Worst experience ever.,0
"Positive about the class: 1) Work was not hard - a few journals and weekly discussion board - both were interesting. 2) Learned a lot BY READING the textbook. Negatives: 1) exams were HARD - 1 hr, 50 questions, no review, over 8 chapters. 2) He wouldn't always respond emails. 3) He didn't seem to care much about the students. 4) Lectures not good.",1
plan to take someone different for ASL 121. Hopefully it will be a better experience.,0
She is so sweet and honestly one of my favorite teachers Ive ever had. I took French 1 with absolutely no background in french and passed with a 99. She tells you everything you need to know for tests and always emails back pretty quickly. You get points for each day you are in class and you learn important stuff everyday so you should go to class,1
"If you have little interest in math and are expecting an easy A from an online course, FORGET ABOUT IT! This class is by far the most challenging class. The quizzes are hard and the exams, well forget about that too because it's no material you've gone over. I would never recommend this class to anyone!",0
"She fabulous, encouraging, insightful. She provides feedback and helpful comments and she kept me incredibly interested.",1
When she lectures you'll have zero clue what she's talking about. She will go rant about anything she feels like and its not related to Sociology at all. As long as you show up for attendance points and print out material she emails out for exams you'll be fine. It's an easy A but I don't understand how she's a professor at YSU.,0
"Proff itself isnt too bad at teaching. She is nice and caring, but very strict. Her tests are alot more difficult than other proffs. Take any other proff if you want a good mark, or else youre risking your gpa!!",0
Mrs. Padgett is the worst teacher I have ever had. She is EXTREMELY scatterbrained therefore can never stay on topic. She claims to go by the syllabus but never does. She also picks favorites which get graded differently than the rest. Her grading varies by student or what mood she is in.  She is very unprofessional and inappropriate.,0
Wayyyyy too many readings from various books. No tests except for a take home mid-term. One paper that you work on all semester and pop quizzes on the readings. Real cool guy who will help when needed. ,1
"Mr Cone gives really interesting lectures and is a great professor. Four tests were are we were graded on, though, so you really need to be at class and take notes as much as possible to get a good grade. He gives a study guide with questions that come straight from the notes so as long as you show up to every class it's pretty easy.",1
"She's awful.  I'm taking her for Phonetics, which she says isn't her ""specialty.""  She never knows the right answer, and we're always correcting her because she contradicts herself. Maybe she's good at teaching other subjects, but not this class",0
oh my god what should i start with. first the class is way harder than it seems. u have to do so much work besides walking in the field for 4 hrs regardless of the weather. quizes are redicules. be prepared to know all the trees and flowers that u see and know everythiing he says. ton of memorization.,1
This was by far the hardest class I have taken. All of his work is close together. The good thing is he realizes that and works with you on the time frame. Be prepared to STUDY!!! He does not allow enough time for quizzes and exams and they are extremely difficult!,0
Great professor for a upper division class. However horrible professor for a general education course.,0
One of the most insecure profs I've ever had. She knows her background and lectures are useless so she demands attendance as part of your grade. She cannot give explanations for the grades she gives and she definitely grades off her personal opinion of students. The assignments are super easy but just time consuming. Textbooks are not necessary.,0
She is very understanding! Don't take her online class if you have procrastination though,1
"The worst professor at Howard! This is why we have such low bar passage. The class was dull, useless and uninformative. I taught myself Con law",0
Thank you very much .,1
"Pete was a wonderful teacher this past semester. He was fun, energetic, and willing to broach the hard topics to get us to think. As long as you show up to class, participate, and do the daily response papers (a few sentences minimum) you will find it to be fun and enlightening, He is willing to help if you need it and will explain further as well.",1
"Dr. Pham is such a genuine, hardworking, and caring professor. She is very clear with the material she teaches and ensures that the students understand the concepts. She knows exactly what she is talking about (she has had experience in the field) and is also very straightforward with what she expects from students.",1
He gave to much homework. Never understood his lectures. His lectures did not make sense. He was all over the place so unorganized. Grades harsh. On the test he deductes for every little mistake you do. I do not recommend at all.,0
"Class is really not needed because she covers the material from 335 all over again. Then at the end of the semester she goes over some new stuff, which can be covered in a few days. She requires attendance, has two projects. The way she words things is very unclear, therefore ask questions in class, she will give answers in class.",0
"This class was awful. I hoped to learn more about forensics, since I'm in the field, but all he did was make us read stuff about the 'corrupt' forensic scientists. I learned nothing about forensics at all, just how some scientists have done poor work. Do not recommend AT ALL.",0
"I think he is a really good teacher, interesting assignments, you learn a ton, and he's so knowledgeable. I'd reccomend the Revolution in China class, great topic and his specialty.",1
"He makes it difficult for a general ed course. He gives random pop quizzes a midterm and 4 to 5 speeches I believe. If you want to major in Coms take his course, if you just need the class as a requirement or transfer, look else where. Im doing fantastic in Organic Chemistry and was struggling in his class if that provides any sort of refrence",1
"By far my favorite professor at LSU thus far. She is really understanding and super cool. This was definitely a class I looked forward to and never hesitated to skipping. She makes it go by so fast. There is a midterm and finals, and quizzes, however, they are really hard. She is a great teacher and I would recommend her to all my friends.",1
"Professor Waldner is a great professor. Do not be fooled, if you are not willing to study you can't expect an A. Study her notes and follow her study guide, and you'll be fine. Yes, she's hot!",1
She is kind and prays for her students every day. It would be helpful if she actually taught the material. There is a pervasive feeling of frustration in the class and she ends the discussion if there are too many questions. I have an A but feel that I may need to retake the class from someone else so I actually learn the material.,0
"""If you don't read EACH chapter THREE times before the test, you won't get above an 80."" He's not lying, his tests are extremely hard and you learn 20 chapters in 3 short months. Your saving grace will be the MindTap homeworks and the business plan. Really passionate marketing guy, really hard professor.",0
"If you've taken ENG 308, here it is again...I think Pam tried to switch things up a little bit, but it was hard to see over the sarcasm and fake smiles.  Good luck!",0
"Honestly, I picked this teacher based on the reviews on this website. I was not impressed at all. I had a difficult time getting in contact with her, calculating my class grade was literally impossible until the end of the semester, and she definitely graded quite harshly for a freshman level class. I would not take another of her classes again.",0
"If you have her for UI100 RUN!!! This was supposed to be an easy class but we had 2-4 worksheets of homework every day. The projects were also difficult. She wrote her own ""workbook"" you have to use almost your whole printing money to print out and then fill out the pages. We also had to recite these weird pledges to her at the beginning of class..",0
Shes a pretty good professor she will help you a lot!!!!!,1
"By far the most unorganized class I have been apart of at NC State. He only communicates through email, he lost student's assignments multiple times. I felt like I was taught nothing and had to figure it out on my own. He is a nice guy and a genius in AutoCAD but I just did not enjoy him as a teacher. You will probably get a high grade in the class",0
"Personally I felt the course was a bit unorganized and formatted in an usual way. There is a lot of reading and the course is broken down into multiple assignments. If you put in the effort, it's possible to get a good grade in this class, it can just start to feel dragged out pretty quickly.",0
"This is a very easy class, but her workload is just way too ridiculous. I wouldnt take this class unless you prefer lots of practice and long homework assignments. Taking it with her was my second time taking it, and ended with worse grade than i did than the first time.",1
"There are weekly online quizzes, which are generally pretty easy and follow the book. However, his lectures do not follow the book at all/boring. The midterm and final are essay questions where you are expected to write 2 pages per question. There are 3 major papers throughout the class based upon supplemental books and a topic of your choice.",0
"Professor Abara is hilarious! He makes class interesting, however, a lot of what he says in class doesn't pertain to what's on the test. He seems to get carried away with certain topics. However, he tells you exactly what to study for your tests; the homework is easy and helps A LOT. Go to class, do the homework, and look over his ppts to get an A.",1
"Mr. Carter was honestly the BEST communications teacher I have ever had!! No matter how bad of a public speaker you are, you will not feel intimidated in his class. He makes it so easy to speak in front of a crowd! Everyone needs to take his class!",1
"Randy is a really cool professor! He does have a sort of monotone voice which make his lectures kind of boring, especially at 7am, but he's still a cool dude nonetheless. He's pretty flexible with assignment due dates. There's one piece of homework and one quiz due each week--not too bad.",1
"Dr. Weston is a great prof. You need to know this class will probably be one of the most time consuming classes in your program. Research Methods isn't hard, but it is very in-depth and will require a lot of work and time, especially if you take the 7.5 week version. The hefty final project is due in the 5th week and there are badly worded exams.",1
"She is amazing!! Such a genuine teacher, you can tell she really wants her students to learn. The only downside is I found the tests super hard. All of her lectures are done in class with handouts and discussion so you NEED to go to class or else you will miss important info. She is hands down one of my favourite teachers so far!",1
Professor Bledsoe is a great teacher he is so excited and passionate about his work. He grades very lightly and most writing assignments you can get a full grade on if you just complete them. It was an easy A and I learned a lot about writing,1
Whip smart redhead with a wit to boot. She is extremely passionate about sign language and loves to watch students improve. Take her class seriously and you will do fine.,1
"It really seemed like This professor just picked up this class in her spare time, but didn't really care about it. She showed up to our lab section once the whole semester, and for about half of the lectures she brought in guest speakers. The homework was inconsistent and seemed arbitrarily selected.",0
"I was not a fan of Professor Hoke. This was her first time teaching research methods and it showed. Her lectures had nothing to do with the topics we were talking about and all she did was ramble about nothing. Her power points also have nothing to do with the exams, mostly based on the book. So make sure to purchase it. Did not enjoy this class",0
"Lydia Palma teaches her lecture well. She writes her notes on the projector, and explains the step by step process for each problem.  Her exams are fair and easy as long as you study previous homework problems. She open to change, and always tries to engage with her students. There should be no reason why you shouldn't pass.",1
"Be prepared to give much detail to your answers when she asks questions, if not she will make you feel that your answer isn't good enough, even when you are right.  Has no sense of humor and is not helpful at all.  I advise you to read your material before coming to class. WOULD NOT TAKE HER AGAIN!",0
Very arbitray in his grading and is boring in class. AVOID if at all possible. I didnt heed the advice and now have this as my worst class in my CAREER,0
"Tough grader, I did not open my textbook one time, passionate about the material so class is more interesting",1
"This is an English class, having to write many papers should not come as a surprise. Lisa is absolutely wonderful. She's so helpful, lenient, and understanding. Papers were very reasonable and of course she wants you to work hard on them but she isn't a super tough grader. There used to be a 12 pg final but instead she added one more 4-7pg essay.",1
"I absolutely love Prof Cutler. If you do take her class though, be ready to work for your grade. Attendance isn't mandatory but your grade will be MUCH higher than someone who skips if you go to all of the scheduled class sessions. She is very caring and I recommend having her as a professor. Highly recommend skimming lessons in book before class.",1
"Dr. Lamas is a fantastic professor. He is well-organized, good at explaining difficult concepts, and communicates clearly. There are many readings that are difficult to comprehend but as long as you try hard, you will do good. The essays are tough, but if you ask for help and utilize the tutors, you will pass. The class was very interesting to me",1
Talks about race too much....knows a lot about math but doesn't know how to teach It,0
"Going to class was intimidating, she belittles your opinions and will sit on ONE question the entire class period because she refuses to give you the answer. You have to work to find the right answer which has to be the exact answer she is looking for. Something is due every class period, so come prepared because she calls on everyone at some point",0
"I really wanted to like this class because the material was so interesting. However, the professor was very unorganized, not posting assignments until the middle of the week that they were due and very unresponsive to emails. I wanted to be understanding due to the pandemic but people told me she's always been this unorganized.",0
Professor Meehan's class is pretty boring but the material you get from the class is more than what she provides on the outlines.  Her tests are straight forward but only study what she talked about in class.  Wouldn't even recommend getting the textbook because she narrows down what you need to know.,0
"Prof wu is a very kind and sweet person. All you need is his ppt slides and lab sessions, you can learn pretty much everything from it. Do not skip the lab sessions. Properly scheduled and planned homework, projects and quiz. He is always ready to clear your doubts in class and outside class too. Would definitely take his classes again.",1
I took this class as a distance learning course from Armwood.  The professor never replied to any form of communication and was not at all understanding when I was unable to upload videos of my speeches due to internet restrictions at school and deadlines conflicting with mandatory afterschool activities.,0
"He is possibly the worst professor I've ever had. Drop the class if you get him trust me, you'll thank yourself. He doesn't teach. It's his way or no way. He gets upset at each student if they get a bad grade on the test. If you wanna pass, get a different professor!!",0
"Have to start this review by saying that this prof. is SO passive aggressive. Will make class optional, but guilt you into being there if you so choose to skip. Not to mention, the material is difficult to begin with. I, personally, found this professor sometimes snarky and difficult to converse with. He is quick to shut people down.",0
"Never liked math before, but he makes it seem so easy, tests arent difficult, homework is online, and you can take tests in math lab if you want... Really dont even have to be there. He is just an overall good teacher. He teaches high school, so he only has night classes, if he taught every subject I would for sure take him, you should too.",1
"For her lectures in the class, bring your laptop to type or record the lecture. She talks fast and goes through concepts quickly! She's always open to questions so definitely ask away. The class is content heavy so you really will have to pay attention to the details she says.",1
She gives a lot of homework. Doesn't open the homework at the end of the  Semester. Grades that's worth no percentage drops your grades the most.,0
"I'm three classes into the semester and I already know this is going to be the most draining class I've ever taken. There's 100 points total in the whole class, so every single point really matters to your grade. He's very intimidating and demanding and has so patience for questions. He teaches the course like a high level MBA class, which is scary",0
Sitting through this class is utterly painful. He gives you a syllabus but rarely sticks to it. He makes you buy a textbook you barely use b/c you need to get 3 course materials packets (that he uses). He teaches the same idea abut 10 times and then moves onto another one. I have no clue what the final will even test on,0
"Mr. Milton is very nice, but this class leaves much to be desired. The amount of information in this class is by far the largest of any class I've ever taken, and the lectures are very poor, with little effort. Students are not given nearly enough information on what they will actually be tested on. Students are essentially left to teach themselves",0
"Overall, he is a man that knows his stuff. His work and critiscm is by far some of the best you can get on that campus. However, his grading and expectations is sometimes over the top and ridiculous. He holds everyone at a professional expectation which is good and bad. He has no censor and says whatever he wants. Overall 3 stars.",0
If you're concerned with your grades I would highly recommend taking this class from another instructor. The classwork is far more extensive than needed and the instructor is very inflexible.  You will be required to do several hours unrelated volunteer work and raise a virtual child online which is time consuming and holds little educational value,0
"He puts things in the simplest terms, no beating around the bush. He is a character and will explain things as many times it takes for you to understand. Very patient, very caring teacher. He is willing to give extra credit as long as you show interest in the class and participation. I highly recommend him. Speaks English/Spanish.",1
Diane is extremely nice but I would not recommend her if you're looking for a professor who will help you out. Tests are basically all she relies on for grades and she doesn't give any extra credit out. She talks about her kids a lot so she gets side tracked and then starts rushing through sections.,0
"I took his online class and it was the best thing I could have done for my GPA.The assignments are weekly and the questions are right from the book.Only downside,he took a little long posting grades. For me,it was one class I didn't have to stress about.",1
"The class was online, you had to respond to a discussion once a week, and had 3 days to complete a 8 page papers. Take her if you don't mind all of your weekends disappearing.",0
"Took the hybrid class; met in class twice a week for 50 minutes&had an easy blackboard response due each week. I dropped halfway because I wasn't learning how to write with her and wasn't sure how well I was going to do without learning much. She's nice. One complaint: She took so long to grade essays, I don't even know what I got on my first one.",1
This class is an incredible amount of work for what it should be with not a lot of notice in between assignments. Mandatory attendance and participation and on top of that the professor is a little bit harsh so it doesn't make for a comfortable leaning environment. You don't learn any valuable programs or anything the work is all busy work.,0
Lectures are boring they will put you to sleep. Sometimes test questions arent from the lectures. Requires lock down browser makes it so uncomfortable.,0
Shawna is really nice but is completely inaccessible outside of class nor does she (or the TA) respond to emails. The group project is terrible  if you get stuck with a bad group ..... good luck Charlie :-) super easy but disappointed overall since I was really looking forward to learning about US policy from a current mayor,0
avoid at all cost.,0
Hard class. A lot of studying will give you a C.,0
"This professor just reads out the the book, easy A. But did not learn anything, he spoke more about music than he did math. The math class I took after him I was lost due to lack of prep by Zaino. ...",0
"Fantastic guy.  Gives great examples, tells corny jokes you can't help but laugh at, and is a very fair grader.  Does everything in a very upfront, easy to understand fashion, and presents the material very well.
 
 HIGHLY recommended",1
"He is a good professor! He is really funny and often makes jokes during class. I especially like how he gives you a note packet, instead of saying look at the book.",1
I love RIT,0
Dra. Hess is extremely friendly and her tests are very easy. her students' success is a big concern for her.,1
"WOW. i literally met with her everyday after class, went to the writing center- and spent atleast 5 hours weekly studying for her class, Still got a C. She is ridiculous- and expects you to answer exactly the way she wants- or no points. Deflates grades- highest grade in the class was a b-. this is NOT ok",0
"One of the worst professors I've taken. Mocked students who ""should've learned the material in grade school"" and was often unwilling to explain calculations in class. Cancelled Friday classes without making up for the time lost and seemed perpetually unhappy. Tests were 2-3 problems and significantly different from homework and lecture problems.",0
"Yes, he is hard and serious for those who are only interesting getting diplomas without adequate learning. Sorry for them.",1
She failed to teach things well to the point I learned more about U.S history in my Africa class. She spent two whole days going over Indians in the new world and spent maybe five minutes on the American revolution. Her class is random crap she decides to talk about. She repeats things differently and goes too fast. Powerpoints were useless.,0
"I've had this professor a few times, he's amazing. He is very approachable, his lectures are absolutely fantastic and easy to follow, homework is easy, exams are multiple choice and he gives you plenty of material to study from (old exams + the answers, and study guide) . Everything is posted online, he'll even record lectures if you want him to!",1
Sweetest lady ever. So cute.,1
Mr. Prey is my favorite teacher of all time!! Took him in high school and then again at rio. He makes every class fun and interesting and really cares about his students and their ability to understand and learn the material. He is the smartest person Ive ever met and knows everything about science.,1
She is amazing! Take her if you want an easy A!,1
"Some people were permitted late work and some weren't despite same reasons. Grading of drawings is inconsistent: a student loses 5 points for having a dimension line that is too long and another student loses 1 point for the same same line, same length. Why? I don't know. You teach yourselves, get others to help you. He does a short demo each day.",0
"She is a very nice and helpful professor. She is by far one of the best. She is very helpful during office hours. Stop by if you do not understand something during class and she will clear it up. Seven homeworks, Seven quizzes, two exams, one 3-4 page term paper. She is by far the best. It makes up for the term paper.",1
Not a bad person but insisted that we brought the $120 text book and that if we didn't we would be required to drop the class. Upon buying the book a week later he made the class online and you were not longer required to have the book.,0
"He has an accent, but easy to understand.  He has a good sense of humor and tries to answer questions. He had to cover a lot of material so recommends that you get a tutor if you cannot understand beyond the classroom.  He does give opportunity to go over HW questions on following week. Very fair teacher. Don't miss class - you'll miss a lot!",0
She has no idea what she is talking about sometimes and often relies on outdated information. Tests are quite unique and are fairly simple.  Very condescending with no good reason and students have even shown to better comprehend the textbook material. This Prof was the very reason I switched institutions.,0
"If you are taking Trigonometry with Prof. Gaworecki, then get ready to spend most of the semester focusing solely on Trig. You will have to keep up with her during lectures and she hands out pop quizzes every other day. (I would recommend studying the homework before class in order to not fail the pop quizzes.) Study weeks before the exams to pass.",0
"If you enjoy reading, take this course. It is a book a week plus projects.",1
"Worst professor I have ever had. It seems like she is never prepared for lecture. She mumbles, and if you pay attention to what she is saying she repeats the same idea several times in one sentence, just reworded. She does not know how to help students and when you ask her one question, you're left with many more after her answer.",0
"Hands down worst professor I ever had, talks down when people speak up in class ""The class room is a place to learn, not a place to ask questions"". Very unclear as to what is being taught during class, 1/2 of the content she lectures is about china and nothing to do with the course outline. Highly recommend to NOT take a course she lectures.",0
"I am currently taking Hunsche in a thurs. night class for intermediate Algebra.  Last sem. I dropped my class due to not being able to understand the material which I believe was due to the prof. I chose.  I signed up for this class and currently have an A. As others say as long as you TRY, its impossible to fail!! RECOMMEND!!",1
"One of the best professors I've EVER taken. Prof. Mangone taught the second half of Genetics, one of the more difficult classes a Bio major will take. I loved his lectures and he was very inspirational. I decided to take his BIO494 class on RNA the next semester and I am so glad I did. He will inspire the crap out of you. I wish I could write more!",1
He is very helpful and understanding.,1
Was her first semester teaching Crim Pro. Slides were very helpful. Exam wasn't bad. Essay was one of those you can never finish bc of some many issues. She was a good teacher. Would take another class with her.,1
"Dr. Ramey is a very good lecturer and really knows his stuff. He doesn't say attendance is mandatory but you have in-class assignment every class for credit. Show up, do the readings, and study the night before each test and you should get an A. Highly recommended.",1
One of the most intelligent professors I have ever met. Slides have clear logic for students to follow. Definitely should take it if you wanna gain some real perspective in bio.,1
"By far the best professor I've ever had! If you go to class and pay attention, you will do great! He has lots of extra credit and drops several test/quiz grades. HIGHLY RECOMMEND",1
10/10 would recommend. Really knew the topic and brought in guest speakers almost every week which was really interesting. Tests were open book - take notes on the lectures too!! Easy grader on the midterm paper,1
"Great professor, willing to work with you if you're taking the class seriously.",1
Great Professor. Really cares about her students and wants you to pass. She is helpful and understanding. The course may be stressful at times but she is always willing to help. I would highly reccomend and take her again for any chem class if I could.,1
If you do the weekly labs and take the quizzes you will get an A,1
This was a very easy online class. Just remember the due dates and you'll be fine. A lot of the exam questions come from the book so you will use it.,1
DO NOT DO EXTRA CREDIT!!!!!  Unfair with grading students extra credit after working all weekend to complete a packet.,0
"Please don't give yourself a heart attack by taking her, this is not fair in pandemic putting so much pressure on students and heavy test and tough in grading. So Big NO! just run away!",0
Great Professor. As long as you do the reading and re-read slides you can pass the class with a good grade. Discussions are a key part of the curriculum. Took it during summer and therefore it was very reading intensive. Clicker questions about the readings. Just do what youre suppose to to and youll be fine. Is lenient with attendance.,1
Very bad professor. Very unclear. Bad english skills. Very bad people.Is better when he doesn't attend.,0
"Easiest class I have ever taken. I enjoyed learning as well. I suggest taking this class with a harder class (like micro, anatomy). All exams are open note and open book. Theres no way to fail. I have no idea how he is not 5/5! Great class and professor!",1
"Lectures are very detailed and, therefore, helpful (if the material is new for you) or boring (if you know the stuff). If you did not understand anything during a lesson, he will explain it several times and not to go futher until you are satisfied with the answer.  Sometimes gives examples from real life to make you understand better.",1
The professor made us buy a lot of material on our own or we could get it from him for about $150. I suggest you share supplies with a classmate. I had a baby weeks before the semester was over. He let me turn in my work a week after everyone else thank God. We had to make a book and turned in a portfolio. Easy teacher just a lot of work.,1
"She is a very nice indivudual but I felt she did not connect with all the students in the class. At times she looked at me like ""Are you in my class"" and she did have her favourites. Both Exam were HARD. Her marking not so easy either. I always felt what she was teaching made sense in her own head but most of us had no clue what she was saying.",1
"I ended up dropping this course. I would do every homework assignment, quiz/test & try extremely hard on them and still couldn't get up to a passing grade. I would spend hours working on labs/homeworks & still couldn't get above a 40 in the class, instead of offering help, she suggested I drop the course because I was not going to be able to pass.",0
"I took 2601 with Dr. Isley and she made such a huge impact on my entire class. The curriculum was awesome, we gained hands-on, real world experience and went in-depth into theoretical aspects of features writing. Since leaving her class, I have not had a better journalism professor. She is so caring and resourceful. Wish I could add more.",1
"I attended every lecture and took notes, but pretty much taught myself everything. It was difficult because the professor was not clear nor helpful. To be honest, he didn't seem that enthusiastic about teaching nor did he show genuine care for his students. If I could retake the class, I would choose a different professor.",0
"Took Drugs and Behavior with her. She is AMAZING! Greatest professor I have had at NAU. Cares about students and their success. Difficult content, but she makes it easier to understand.",1
"He is very good at explaining everything  and answering questions during his lectures. He is willing to help during his office hours. He does assign a lot of hw, but I think that's why I actually learned something.",1
Nice guy - but he knows nothing asbout MIS - this is not a computer science class - it should be about business.,0
"This professor was amazing! I took him last fall and although he was intimidating at first, he made it extremely comfortable to speak to him and in class. I enjoyed his lectures and have actually registered for the other two classes he offers despite them not being required for my degree. I highly recommend him to anyone who's willing to do it.",1
The information she provides in the lectures is rarely if ever useful. She is not helpful if you ask for advice regarding studying. The tests are incredibly difficult and specific. They cover everything from the book and the lecture. Also the powerpoints are not uploaded to webcourses so take notes and pictures!,0
"BUAD 205 is not a difficult class. Attendance is taken for a grade, so by just showing up everyday you can earn 100 points (600 total points in the course). Dr. Ranft is a friendly guy and does an excellent job guiding discussion. ",1
"I am taking his class for Calculus II which is the hardest. He is a good teacher, however, definitely speaks and do math too fast!! Pop quizzes once a week, projects in every section. Calc II is a very challenging course. Prof Le is not the nicest and helpful teacher I know. He requires over usual math skills. Overall he is OK. You have to work...",1
Good professor.  Awesome Class!,1
"GREAT professor. Definitely cares about students and gives every opportunity to improve ones grade. This class is not easy, but its not supposed to be, If you put in the effort and READ the textbook you will get an A. 4 tests each with 25 questions which can be a little tricky. Study hard for them, overall good class with an amazing professor",1
This professor is awesome! One of the most kind and compassionate ones who actually cared about YOU and your academics. He is very warm to students and classes are always something to look forward to. You learn a lot of material in such a short period and he is there helping you right along. Very stress free and laid back environment. ,1
"If taking a class with Singer, be prepared to consult outside resources for help. He is VERY smart, but neglects to go over the basics of new concepts. I used a lot of YouTube videos and other resources. Once you figure out the basics for certain concepts the problems are not hard, but he rarely goes over said basics before jumping to examples.",0
Absolute worst nightmare. He brings up his past prodigies and then makes you feel like a failure if you're not like them. He is so rude and too old to be teaching this class. News is not the same as it used to be and he's very conservative. No matter how hard you work he will not appreciate it. Go to a different school if you want to be on TV.,1
"Great Professor, very fair and helpful.",1
"hilarious guy. great sense of humor and just can't seem to keep from smiling. however, his tests are RIDICULOUSLY hard. and LONG. however, he really wants to help you and he puts a ton of work into the class. its definitely a gpa killer though",1
"Never shows up on time, likes to keep you late. Doesn't ever use the $200 textbook. Not a very patient person or good teacher. I wouldn't recommend her.",0
"Very very nice man, but terrible professor. He does not know how to teach physics at all. Tries to be helpful, but is terrible at explaining things. Lecture heavy! Not much practice with equations, but thats what the exams are on.",0
Fuyez pauvre fou,0
"Midterms and final questions all came from a bank of questions from previous years. The assignments were definitely difficult to do alone and would require you to spend some time each day going to TA office hours to get help. His lectures would go over the concepts of the material, but the assignments were about how to use and apply those concepts.",1
class was great! time flew by and it was clear that he was really into it. he paced back and forth in front of the class and threw his arms up to make a point. really funny and nice guy. hard paper grader but its worth it!,1
"I have signed up for classes I had no intention of taking just because I found out Kellie was the teacher; she is THAT good. Her classes are challenging but fun, and as long as you participate and give it you're all you'll pass without an issue. She's so good at teaching for all skill levels, and she's one of the sweetest people you'll meet.",1
"So rude, just do yourself a favor and dont take her",0
"As someone to tell you how it is in the field, he's fantastic. As a teacher he is slightly better than an online class. I learned the very basic fundamentals of EKG therapy but most of the class was him being late, not responding to emails and repeating himself over and over. He's the only one who teaches required courses so be prepared to teach some things to yourself. Great guy, schmuck of a proffesor.",1
"She grades harshly and takes off points for minor things. She will find any specific thing to mark you off some points. Impossible to get an A on anything. Psych 1 was supposed to be an intro to the subject and class, but no I was welcomed with mistreatment. If you are a Psych Major then sure have at it. But for those who aren't then good luck to u",0
"One of the best teachers I've met here! she has a lot to teach and it's really good stuff too! She's super funny, lives an interesting life and sometime gets off topic but always brings it back with some crazy connection, a little disorganized at some times, but I highly recommend to take any class of hers.",1
Turning in essays she would mark out things I would say and add in something that is much longer and unnecessary. So when you take this class be prepared for your essay to be heavily nit picked. An essay that deserves at least an A is actually graded a B and even closer to a C. Keep in mind your finished grade is based solidly on these essays.,0
"This professor is the worst!! She is rude and mean. She does not care to help students, Laughs at us when we ask questions. She is writes rude emails and is rude when you go to her office hours for help. Despite her being hard to understand and confusing, she is not nice at all.",0
"Professor Graham provided immediate feedback on homework and exams. Very well organized! There were almost daily webassign homework assignments, 11 or 12 written assignments, 4 exams and a final. This is a lot of work, but getting a poor score on one exam won't tank your grade. Note: this class was taken online during COVID lockdown",1
"Great Professor! Extremely helpful, and very easy class! Take Professor Galan! His class is fun, he's very funny, and a really nice professor.",1
"If you struggle with math, I'd highly recommend her class. She explains things throughly. She provides her own lecture notes so make sure you have a printer! Lecture notes are easy to understand. Textbook not required. Typos here & there but we all make mistakes. Super passionate at what she does & cares for her students. Best professor at ELAC!!!",1
"Miller is hilarious and very clear. He is an incredibly knowleadgeable person, and so his lectures are pretty dense. His tests are very long, with 3 essay questions. Howver, he provides extra credit opportunities and makeup for test points. He is hilarious.",1
"She wants you to learn the material, but she also wants you to pass. She is very loving and caring and will help you in any way that she can.",1
Very tough grader but really nice person. She gives great feedback and is accessible outside of class.,1
Go to class and pay attention and you will be fine. He is straight forward and will tell you what to study for each test and the final exam. His notes are very good and labs are not that bad. MUST TAKE FOR ME3500,1
"Sweet Mother of Jesus! That is all I can say after taking his class. All of the other reviews that claim he is disorganized and goes off on tangents frequently are 100% accurate. Plus, he takes forever (months) to grade things. You will learn nothing and be dumber than when you started. Avoid this class at all costs if you value your sanity.",0
"I took her class for the F/W 2019 year and dropped it because she refuses to use any technology whatsoever. If you miss class even for a valid reason such as a doctor's appointment, a family loss, etc., you're screwed because she doesn't use moodle and doesn't post any content online. She often said she never uses her work email and never responds.",0
She's a great teacher but don't miss class after the mid-term. I had a death in the family and couldn't make it to 1 of 3 mandatory classes. Ended up losing nearly 30% of my final grade to one absence. I'm lucky I'd done very well early on or there's no way I could've passed. ,0
She is not a good professor at all. she expects you to have knowledge in what she is supposed to teach. I couldn't understand what she was talking about because she never explained and tried to make it sound more complicated than they were. If you are taking this class you should read the text book for exam and dont care about her lectures.,0
"Dr. Hines's lectures are very confusing, since he often gets the questions wrong. I have attended every class and done all the homework and still do not understand the material because of his lectures. His office hours are during my other classes, so I recommend going to the Study or Mathskellar because his lectures/notes online are not helpful.",0
"All homework and quizzes are done online on a site you have to pay for. That's where the textbook is as well, but I never used it and passed. English is not his first language, so it may be difficult to understand what he says, but powerpoints are clear. Pay attention, show up to take notes and you'll pass. Hands out a clear syllabus.",1
"Do the assigned problems before the lectures, take notes, and create a thorough 1 page of notes for the tests. Jameson truly cares about his students understanding the material and succeeding. He has tons of energy in presenting the lectures and interacting with the class. He also gives extra credit opportunity and drops lowest test score.",1
THE BEST!!! Cares about his students. Flexible. Entertaining. WANTS YOU TO PASS & will do anything he can to help. Takes time to slow down & explain if you're having trouble. All tests are taken in testing center giving (relatively) unlimited time. Willing to extend deadlines. Gives extra credit. Gives test reviews. Responds to emails. Dedicated!,1
TERRIBLE. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND TO MY WORST ENEMY.,0
fernandez-payano made what should've been a good course full of relevant information to make us well rounded and cultured individuals into a nightmare.,0
"Prof Zaitsev is a great teacher. 4 tests, he drops the lowest. Do not miss his labs. I didnt have time to read the book, just learnt the lectures ( he gives printouts ).Micro is not easy, dont expect him to explain everything. You ll have a lot of memorization to do.  Do your work- you ll get an A. ",1
Loved this class!! I've never taught before and I really got to see what it is like to be a teacher. We were able to do lessons with students. It was so much better than just observing for 45 hours.,1
Amazing teacher! Explains everything and is very enthusiastic about History. He's so nice and as long as you go to class and take notes you'll be good. You'll do good on the tests as long as you thoroughly describe everything.,1
"He is such a nice guy honestly really is, but his tests are difficult. Very difficult. I don't know if it is because it is in the split format but we only have 50 minutes to take the test and i feel so rushed.",1
He never tells you what he wants bc he doesnt want to stifle your creativity then takes off points for stuff that wouldve been clear if he gave rubrics. feedback sucks and gets annoyed when you try to talk to him/clarify things. His lectures are cool and so is he but he rambles and is unhelpful. he doesnt realize that hes condescending ALL THE TIME,0
"Homeworks really hard.  Don't take class unless you have to. Its not worth the headache. I disagree with the review below, I chose the labs instead of presentation.  Labs were very easy, basically just pinging and tracerts.  Tests are super hard.  I ended up with an A, but worked really hard for it. Didn't know any grades until the final.",0
"Prof. Rodriguez is excellent. I am currently taking his class online and I couldn't be happier with the way that he structured it. 3 Exams, quizzes, and a big final research paper. The class is not the easiest (its Finance..) but it is very possible to get an A+. The final project is extremely helpful for your career and it's doable. RECOMMENDED!!!",1
"Okay, she is extremely vague in what she wants, yet she is such a hard grader when it comes to essays. Like i have professors in the 200 and 300 english classes giving me A's and A- on my essays, yet she gives me a C?!!! And i still dont understand what she wants from your writing. Class was very stupid.",0
Listen to all the reviews. Do not take his class. Book teaches one way and he teaches another. Homework everyday for no grade. Doesn't review at all. Answers must be in complete sentences to his standards.,0
This class was one of the most disorganized classes I have ever been in.  She tells you one thing and does another or marks in another way.  I don't recomend this class to anyone.,0
"Taking his class is the worst mistake you could ever make.  I hate to say it, but his thick accent makes him virtually incoherent during lectures.  Just make sure that you go to his office frequently and let him know that you're trying, and you'll be OK.",0
"Tests consists of 4 short answers and an essay, the 4 short answers can consists of any of the 40 things we learned before the test",0
"She's shown up late to class nearly every day.  She is vague about her expectations, and the tests and quizzes are a nightmare. Also, I'm not a fan of the way she weighs grades.  It's hard to communicate my questions and concerns to her.  Nice lady, fun personality and funny, but I wouldn't take another class of hers if I could help it.",0
Gupta's idea of teaching is to read the textbook's provided slides while waving his hands around in front of the class as if the students have come in to class knowing the material. Anything that becomes difficult for him to describe is ultimately left out of the lecture. There is also no curve in the class.,0
"Was a nice guy, his lectures sucked though. Got sidetracked often. Fit too much material into tests and quizzes. Posted previous exams online and did a lot of copy pasta, so that helped. Went easy on grading of papers. He would assign 100s of questions and would make it all worth 5 points. Gave a lot of EC to those who stayed for the whole class.",1
"An amazing professor that made me love marketing. He is not here to make it hard, rather give you the facts and make it relatable and fun. Engaging in the class makes class discussions fun and the quizzes as well as the midterm is open note and the final is a group project that's fun.",1
"VERY HARD TEACHER. He's a Great person and a very smart professor, but he's NOT a GOOD teacher at all. I felt lost throughout his lectures until i started reading the book, then everything began to make sense. Doesn't know how to get a message across and to top it off his tests are just impossible to do in 50min. Not recommended. Great guy though.",0
I've had her for ten chem & ochem1&2. She's a sarcastic person but not hard to get along with. I don't recommend her classes for people who take things too personally. Her classes are tough because they're based on tough subjects. She's really pushes you to think and apply your knowledge.,1
"Try to avoid him. The class is lecture heavy so if you skip you will be lost! He never tells you what is on the tests. In class you will learn mostly math, but the tests are all conceptual short answer. His tests are harshly graded because he is very picky about what he wants. Print the slides and write on them as the notes. Write down everything",0
Very nice professor. Will help you if you need anything. Tough information that he explains really well - so go to class and make your own notes in the sidelines of his slides so it's clear to you. Tests are based only on what he talks about in class (somewhat hard).  Suggest buying the book online through Aplia (he will explain that) saves MONEY!,1
"Dr. Bottomley made the somewhat boring class that is E101 interesting and worthwhile. She is hilarious and wants her students to do well. Definitely go to her for any problems and questions you have with FEDD because she is very helpful. She is a great lady to know, and I would take a class with her again.",1
"He is a nice guy, but he is not a thorough Prof. Unless you have had some background  in the statics, I would advise you NOT to take him. He didn't offer extra credit and lots of people were confused during his lectures.  ",0
"I love Quinlan! He's so awesome and fun and his stories really help you understand what he is teaching! He is very funny and he gives out a lot of extra credit points on tests if you speak up in class. You are rewarded for being a well rounded student in his class. Talk to him about sports, he'll love you.",1
She is way too excited--treats her 101 class like high school students. Too much work for an intro-level 101 class. Doesn't know how to discipline a class either.,0
Dr. Morgan is a great professor. He takes time to individually teach you things if you ask him to and will not stop explaining until you fully understand. His Lab Practicals are very difficult. If you do not take his advice about looking at models and slides you will not pass his practicals.,1
"Professor Fritch is amazing. Whether you are in the class or online, she has a way of capturing your attention about things you would not ordinarily think about. Her online class is layed out better than most online classes. There is not much homework as long as you stay on top of the assignments. They're simple, just do them and you get an easy A.",1
Dr. Kahn is a nice professor who does not know how to direct a classroom. She tends to let people get the class off topic and it usually results in a tangent which takes up most of the class time. She teaches at a high school level and tests at a grad level. She also takes around 2-4 weeks to grade tests. If you can take another professor do so.,0
One of the most interesting professors I have ever had. If you get the chance to take a class taught by him I would highly recommend it.,1
"Overall he is a good Professor. He does care for you, he wants you to learn and pass. I've leaned this by being in his class, I can tell by his great personality. So do the work, participate in class, and you'll be just fine.",1
"Not big on Shakespeare, but what an easy class. He's an easy grader and using sparknotes really helps",1
"Great prof. He taught in france for a few weeks, in my uni. Great course though the test is pretty difficult!",1
She's the best professor I've ever had. Highly recommend this class!,1
"This was my second class with Prof Williams. The exams are definitely more confusing in SF350. Pay attention, take good notes, and study a lot. There is a lot of overlap with the technical details so you have to pay careful attention during lectures and when studying. Use the powerpoints to make sure you have all your notes correct before studying!",1
"Professor Holliway is a solid professor. He does get back to you except on the weekends, and if you send him another email after a day or two of no response, he will get back to you. In psyc, lots of reading, but other than that, I am on the path to a fairly easy A.",1
Amazing teachers. Does her best to help students.,1
"Great teacher, Got everyone involved. Graded easy. Made a scary class fun. I definitely recommend her for speech!!!",1
"I really wish there was a tag option that says: DOES NOT CARE. I reached out to her several times throughout the semester, received a response 1 in every 5 times. She doesn't care about her students whatsoever and an all around horrible professor. The idea behind her extra papers is fine, but she gives you nothing to go on. DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS",0
"Ms. Lhota is a very nice lady. I had her for English 101, which she doesn't usually teach, but she still showed all of the qualities of a good professor. She is always willing to review your work and give you constructive feedback. Overall, Easy A, just do the essays and you're golden.",1
"I could never recommend this professor.  His lectures are uninspired and quite frankly a waste of time, his homework assignments are extremely inflexible (especially to those who have work hours), and he gives quizzes on material irrelevant to anything we've done in class.  He rarely answers class questions and also curves downward.",0
"This is probably an amazing class in person. Online it is pretty bad. First off, she used someone else's video lectures and worksheets. She didn't teach a single thing. We had mandatory group meeting in place of class. The actual work is very easy except on Sunday's expect to have 6 or 7 worksheets due. This makes getting the work in difficult.",0
Grades hard for no reason. Its an easy class you just get no chance to ask questions because she acts like your dumb if you do.,0
"Great professor! Kind, caring, understanding. Wants you to succeed.",1
She assigns readings and make sure you read them. She doesn't give study guides or lets you review the hw or tell you what to study. Make sure you go to lectures for attendance and lecture questions on tophat. Screenshot the questions because that's the only time you'll see them. Lectures are beyond boring personally but she's really into it.,0
"At first the content seemed to be way over my head but after a few classes i loved it!  if you give it a chance and really try to understand what the articles are saying, you will be so much more enlightened on English as a whole.  Rivas did an amazing job at teaching this subject and is very helpful.",1
"I took educ 275 with Karen. You have to go to class every day, and some days get long but the content is really important if youre wanting to go into education. There are two group projects and a few essays, but she cares more about content than rubric. Most days are class discussion or presentation. Definitely recommend for future teachers",1
"I love this man! Gorgeous, Gorgeous, Gorgeous!!!",1
"Dr. Guerra is AMAZING! Very organized, detailed, and inspirational educator. He motivates you to be the best performer version of you. Super detailed feedback that will empower you to overcome your mistakes and do brilliant for the rest of the semester. You must take him if you want to learn in a professional production environment. He is funny too",1
"Dr. Beckman is a very knowledgeable and intelligent professor, his classes are very interesting and usually not too difficult if you pay attention in class. You will probably do a few projects in his class, but he doesn't give too much homework and is a very fair grader.",1
Can't listen to her as she never uses microphone,0
"1 of the BEST Professors I ever had. Amazing lectures, caring, if you need anything just ask. She will do anything for her students. The workload may seem like a lot, but it is easy and it is good for you to learn. Also the stuff she has you do will HELP YOU get a job someday, that is why she has you do it, SO DO IT and do it right!",1
Absolutely love this professor.He explains material very thoroughly. Love his attitude. You will laugh in his class- no doubt. Go to his office hours!,1
"The worst. Unclear on expectations and grading criteria, but grades extremely harshly. Also never grades anything on time, I turned in one of 2 assignments (for the entire class) in JANUARY and he didn't grade it until MARCH 4 days before grades were due. btw i am a 4.0 student, do my work diligently, and still would NEVER recommend",0
Dr. G's class was great. He lays out a clear path to follow and you just do the work. Writing English at a basic adult level is needed to pass. If you write like a ten year old child then you get a D. Like you literally have to be totally ignorant about writing to fail his class.,1
Bunch of busy work so much effort required for basic grades. Way too cheerful. Definitely has favorites.,0
"Professor Wheeler makes lecture enjoyable and interesting. I believe the class is way too hard for a 100 level so if you are looking for an easy GenEd, this isn't the one for you. A ton of reading outside of class. Befriend your TA for sure.",0
"Oksana is a wonderful teacher. If you are in the LYHS field, particularly Tourism, you will understand what she expects. She knows what she is teaching and will help you if you ask for it. I have a very close relationship with her and look up to the knowledge and experience she has.",1
"Fun and informative class, with a knowledgeable and laid back teacher.  I have every intention to take a class from him again.",1
"He's really helpful and want his students to pass. Very passionate about the subject and knows his work. He talks all throughout his class time but his stories are interesting. Attendance is not mandatory but you will want to be there, 4 exams notes come from the textbook and his own notes/worksheet packets. Awesome professor. Highly Reccomend!",1
"Ok look.I got like a 95% in this class. Tons of homework and quizzes that prepare you for the exams. You can always contact him to take a quiz that you missed within a week of the quiz. He doesn't post his lectures but his lectures are extremely relevant and useful every time! Don't miss class, you will regret it. Just go to class!!!",1
She WILL help you become a better speaker and her assignments will challenge you to think outside the box. She doesn't critique too hard but you will have to work for that A. She will straight up tell you that she has no problem dropping and failing people who don't show up or do the work. One midterm and final.,1
"Professor Soniak's class had a lot of extensive readings, but they were all high quality and informative. There are multiple papers that require research and analysis. The assignments all have clear grading criteria. He gave constructive feedback to help me understand new material and form a deeper understanding of politics.",1
"Doctor Mavica is a beautiful middle of the road, neither strict nor lenient. She requires attendance and some participation, but she talks about information thats not exactly necessary but is interesting and pertinent. She cares for each of her students and is relatable. If you dont like profs that can get off topic, she may not be for you.",1
"Kim is a nice and down to earth guy BUT he never answers emails, he confuses himself when he talks, and he goes through the lecture so fast. The class is a teach yourself course and half online. There are three tests, 10 connect HWs (one extra credit), and different assignments here and there.",0
"Melissa is a great prof! The class was not too hard. Basically do the reading, listen in class, do your work, study for like 15 to 20 mins for test and you should pass. She is really funny (and really sassy!) she is fun to listen to with class discussions. Highly recommended class and prof!",1
"He's an all around good teacher. He takes the time out to help you understand what's taking place.  He does problems on the board to help you understand, which is GREAT because I'm a hands-on and visual learner. I look forward to taking ACC 102. You do have to do work in this class. BE ON TIME for test days or you won't be allowed to take the test.",1
"She is a tough grader. She doesn't know how to teach. I took more than 8 hours to do her each assignment, but she still said I am not work hard. The comments she gives you in the class are different from the blackboard. Don't taking her class!",0
"This was the worst professor I have ever had !!! She is very condescending, I would NOT recommend her at all. You have to go over modules by yourself and then come to zoom sessions and ask questions, if you need a professor that teaches then dont choose her ! Her mid term had 8 or more answer choices per question!!! WORST PROFESSOR EVER",0
"Dr. Hill does a great job at lecturing for the number of students in the class. She is interactive and tries to make what we learn relatable. The tests are not too bad as most questions come from the quizzes, clicker questions, and end of chapter ""self-check"". Overall, as long as you go to class and put in some effort, you will get an A.",1
"I think a lot of people misread her because they don't put forth the effort to really pay attention and talk to her. She can be confusing and unclear (more so in the Research class) but seriously she has been one of the kindest, most inspirational and helpful teachers I've had here. And trust me, she's a good teacher to have on your side!!",1
Dr. Allison was by far the best prof I have had so far while at Conestoga.  He clearly understands what he teaches and is more than willing to sit down with each student and thoroughly explain what you're struggling with. His positive attitude was very appreciated and made him more approachable than other IT profs.,1
"Easy class for biology 2, no anatomy of physio stuff at all; recommends using openstax free text but exams are based on simple powerpoints and are straightforward, mainly multiple choice very easy, & some open-ended q's a little harder. Plenty extra credit weekly. Overall lovely professor and person, you will miss her at end of semester. I love her",1
"Don't take this class too seriously. There were a few people that were just peeing their pants every time something even more complicated came up. Those people just need to know only the exceptional student is going to get EVERYTHING from the course, and that's the way it was designed. I mean come on, we still all got A's.  Chill out, it's DigiPen.",1
"Very clear and organization. Take Tabea's class if you actually want to learn something. Do not use your phone/laptop in class, and participate as much as possible. Super knowledgeable, accessible, and cares about your success. This class was the most ""worth my money"" course I've ever taken.",1
"She is a very nice professor with a very clear explanation for each question. By reading the PPT she provided, and do all the practice, it is easy to pass. She also provided 3 grading policy and she will be based on your grade to see which policy was best for you. Also, she will curve the exam, so you don't need to worry about not passing her class",1
"She was probably the worst professor I've had to deal with. She is an extremely tough grader, when she gets around to grading. Her instructions are extremely unclear and she doesn't tell you due dates. You can't keep to the syllabus since it changed the first day. She was unwilling to answer questions and her questions are extremely open ended.",0
"So this professor isn't great by any means. Yes, he is kind but only in person. I take online classes because I work a lot and I had to go see him if I had a question because he is ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE at responding to email. I never received an email. He also didn't start grading until the quarter was practically over. He contradicts himself.",0
nice guy but jeesh..his class is set up crazy..3 page papers every week is nuts!,0
"Very respectful and easy professor. His lectures are very long, but the way he went about them I for sure take a class of his again.",1
This class was interesting and touched on some topics that may be a little difficult/heavy for some and she does give this disclaimer at the beginning of the course. There was a group project and we did have the opportunity to grade our group members at the end of the course. I am not a fan of group projects but it went well. I'd take her again.,1
"I was excited to take geology and now I dread it. She's not the worst teacher; she has a few good moments but don't take her if you can avoid her. The homework takes me two hours and no matter how long I study, I can't pass the tests. There is also wayyy to much work for a gen ed class.",0
best professor i have taken in Moorpark. his lectures are entertaining and his tests are easy. he does a short review the class before the test and he pretty much tells you exactly whats going to be on the test. do the assignments on canvas. they are super easy. i can honestly say i learned a lot from his lectures.,1
A great teacher who cares for us.,1
"She's a really good teacher and the assignments are easy but she's really big on attendance, she is really fun to work with. As long as you go to class nd do your work you ae sure to pass,",1
"This class was amazingly interesting. I loved lecture and section. I found out that history and archaeology can be pretty raunchy. One time I dozed off in class and woke up to, ""...trying to pass it off as the foreskin of Jesus..."" He relates a lot of things to The Godfather and Italians. It's a very fun class and I recommend it to anyone!",1
I have taken 3 classes with Chingling and I have loved her every semester that I have taken her. She is always ready to have deep discussions with you and presentations that end up taking 3 hours of a 4 hour class seem like they take 2 minutes. She always has interesting coursework and is a tough but fair grader. If you like a challenge try her!,1
I am at the start of this course and I already want to drop. After watching his first videos of this course that he uploaded I can already tell hes going to make my life miserable and I am going to want to drop out. He legit did not say one positive thing and he makes it known as if your going to have a rough semester with him. dont take him.,0
Professor Howell is one of the best teachers I've ever had at COCC because she is really great at helping students if they're confused on a topic. She is also really good about checking her email daily even over the weekend if you have questions.,1
"Rizkalla is the only teacher that truly believes we understand him and the material as well as he does, and it shows, because there is no method to his madness . He does pay enough attention to his students and does not try to understand us. this also shows because he will give out a test prep work sheet, and only use 1/4 of it. worst prof ever.",0
"I had her for bio lab and it was literally awful…her accent is so heavy that u cannot understand a single thing she says.I dreaded going to my lab every week bc she cant help u bc u cant understand her.Besides not being able to understand her there were no other prblms,but its just really hard to complete the lab when u have no idea what ur doing.",0
"Energetic and dynamic personality.  She really brought personality theory to life with her real world applications.  Her tests can be tricky some times, but she doesn't put as much emphasis on the exams as she does on class projects and writing assignments.  If you come to class and turn in all of the work you are sure to get an A.",1
"I was so excited to take this class but the professor destroyed the passion I had for the subject. The material is choppy and there are no class discussions. The provided materials are stale, outdated, and unconnected. The test questions are confusing and conflicting information is in the materials provided. Do yourself a favor, pick another class.",0
Loved this teacher. Would definitely take again. Super nice and knowledgeable. Definitely a teacher who cares about her students and their success.,1
He Rocks!,1
"The best teacher I've ever met! Very clear but very complex. You have to push yourself hard,  but not beyond your capacity. A lot of hard reading, but his lectures clarify everything (if you are attentive and present).  Grades not based on Attendence.",1
This was an easy class before I got to this guy...He made everything difficult and made tons of mistakes which made me have to follow up all the time just to make sure that I got the grade I deserved....I was doing my job as a student and his by constantly having to correct everything...Forget it...,0
"Dr. Baddar is fantastic at getting you to think around the literature you'll be reading, she's extremely insightful, and she's definitely someone I look up to, but she's one of the harshest graders I've ever encountered. It wouldn't have been so bad if she gave me feedback, ever. Save yourself, don't take a writing class from her.",0
She prefers women over men. She is very moody. I bet all these good comments were made by women in her class.,0
"Chrissy is THE most inclusive, caring and kindhearted teacher at state. Taking her class will boost your GPA and inspire you to come to class and learn what she has to share! A couple tests online, some discussion papers with easy/personal prompts and that is about it! Chrissy is such a light and amazing energy to have in your day!!",1
"Mathi clearly knows how to do Calculus. However, her delivery is poor IMO. Her accent is heavy and makes it difficult to understand what she is saying. For example, when she says ""8"" she will instead say ""yayyyt"", or instead of ""A"" she will say ""yayyy"". This isn't to be rude, but rather totally honest about my experience with her.",0
"I took this professor for MATH 103, have to withdraw from the class, she covers a lot. But at a very very fast pace and expects you to know everything she covered. I went to tutoring numerous times and still didn't come up with knowledge of the course. She has a more old fashioned type of teaching and her office hours aren't that flexible either.",0
"Hard to hear, her slides don't make sense half the time because she doesn't proof read them. If you ask her something she'll tell you that's too advanced for the class and won't answer.",0
"She is a wonderful professor. I wish I had her for all my classes because she really does explain the material very well. She could be better at grading faster this semester but considering the situation, she gave much more than most of my professors. Her leniency in accepting late work this semester gave me the courage to continue with class.",1
"great teacher, so nice, brought us food, totally understands the subject bc he is in many small businesses himself..pretty hot",1
"First off I got an A in this course. But I don't feel like I learned all that much. THere are way too many moodle assignments (especially focused on small subtopics barely mentioned in the book), come on many of us have work too. Exams are open book, but again you don't learn anything if you take exams that way. ",0
GREAT TEACHER!,1
"He's infatuated with flowery prose, plots that range from wistful to depressing, and image-heavy poetry. That's it. Not helpful if you write genre fiction. Very traditionalist and pushes a literary fiction-or-bust attitude. I took a piece I cared about to him during office hours, and he essentially told me to can it and write something else.",0
"Zaino is a nice person but a bad instructor. His lectures are unorganized and boring. He is often confused about the slides himself. The homework is harder than what is taught in class. There are pop-quizzes, which makes attendance mandatory. Studying from the textbook is a MUST, since he doesn't really teach in class.  I dont recommend taking it!",0
Excellent prof! Very clear and decidedly hot. :),1
If you invest a lot of time outside of class for this class you will be fine. She expects you to practice around 10-20 hours outside of class for accounting. I don't recommend because it's hard to catch up once you don't understand something. She goes through lecture slides very fast.,0
"Took him on his first semester teaching so not sure if my review will still apply. He's very disorganized, unsure of what he's doing, and sadly, boring. He is also slow on grading. Don't think teaching is a right fit for him. Avoid if you want to engage in your learning in an interesting/insightful way.",0
This class is terrible take another one. Class has no direction the lectures are a waste of time and boring have nothing to do with the tests. Just an awful awful awful awful class and professor. Lazy no direction just terrible,0
"Peter is a nice guy, but his class taught me nothing. Very focused on sewing and design, but did not really teach us how to sew. Taught us the bare minimum to code, still didn't understand. The way he explained things was very confusing and never answered his email. If you asked me to code now I couldn't do anything basic. Nice grader tho.",0
I took his psychology 100 class and it was amazing ! I missed a test and he allowed me to make it up. Just by doing the homework and the small writing assignments he assigns youre guaranteed to pass the class. He is really funny and shows some cool videos before class (:,1
"Cool guy. Three papers, best of which counts as a grade. You don't have to do the others if you like your grade on one. Exams were online, questions from his slides which he posts. Participation was mandatory, meaning you have to talk five times throughout the semester.",1
"she cant teach very well, but it is so easy it doesnt matter. I always went to class but never paid attention. I got 60 points more than i needed for an A and didnt even have to take the exam.  She makes it seem like you may be doing bad, but everyone does well",1
"This class is time consuming, but it pays off. 4 lecture exams (final is a retake of lowest test). Nothing in the class is cumulative so you can focus on each segment without worrying about previous material. He gives his students more than enough material to succeed. Use the book, attend lecture, PAY ATTENTION and you'll do fine.",1
"Get ready to read everything he gives you! Tests are for some reason very specific. You'll think you'll understand the concept, but the test will make you search the book for one specific detail. Not a class that i would recommend",0
"Just go to class and you'll do well. Write solid papers and turn them in ON TIME, EVERY TIME. Go to every paper review day and you'll make an A. Just do the work. Pretty funny, obviously loves what he does.",1
One hour assignment on WebAssign 3 nights a week. Due MWF.  CAN HARDLY UNDERSTAND HIM. Tests are a lot harder than class lectures.  no classwork. just lecture notes and the homework.  good thing is homework is 50 percent of grade.  but tests are really hard for the other 50%.,0
"Dr. Veve is a good professor, he truly wants all his students to succeed in his class. Reading the textbook does help, but I made an A without ever reading. The powerpoints and homework are a huge help and a lot of his test questions are pulled from the two. He only grades you on 3 exams, homework/attendance, and the final.",1
"Certain topics introduced in ECE 241, such as bit masking, weren't clearly explained by Dr. Day. This required me to go out and research them for myself outside of class. (not necessarily a bad thing!) Dr. Day would occasionally go off on tangents during lectures that were interesting but not part of the curriculum. He is a very fair grader.",1
"Professor Tulin is great and understanding Professor. For this humanities class we had a good amount of reading but he would have discussions about the readings during class. The assignments of the class were discussion board posts, two tests that were ""essays"" and some group projects. Professor Tulin will listen to students if they are struggling.",1
He makes students life hard; very egotistical and rude.,0
This class is ok but make sure your passing those test! cause if you don't you would probably fail. I think that her 5 step plan doesn't make any sense.,0
"Decent teacher, but he was not understanding at all when I had a severe case of the flu and had to go to the ER on the day of a test. A doctors note from the ER was not enough for him to allow me to retake this exam. I spoke with the dean on this matter and applied for a grade appeal. I highly advise everyone against taking this class with Knox.",0
Lee is really great. Funny and creative,1
Very interesting lectures. This teacher has a lot of great experiences and is very knowledgeable on the subject of Human Resource Management. I would recommend him to anyone.,1
"Mrs. Wright barely taught us anything & barely communicated with us (in-person or through email). Lots of group assignments and quizzes on TB chapters (which you don't have to read). No lecture material. She is not very accommodating or approachable. She does not reply to emails for weeks. The class was an easy A, it was just frustrating",0
"I have never had a professor who is as organized,as intelligent and as respectful to his students as Professor Dattolo. His teaching is to the point and he is very clear in his lectures. He makes understanding Spanish easy. He is highly recommended.",1
"Putnam is a good professor. Study guides for every chapter are very helpful. Talked a lot about morality and law and different cases, which was very interesting. Doesn't post the slides on Bb, and occasionally moves quickly, so I recommend taking notes on a laptop. He will call you out in front of everyone if you talk during his lecture.",1
"Unbeleivalbe how he can be a teacher. Absolutely incomprehensible lectures. He likes to make the students feel stupid when they ask questions. The guy has to realize that we're there to learn the subject; that's why we're asking questions. Never in my life had I been subject to a more useless, confusing-for-the-sake-of-cunfusing teacher in my life.",0
Professor Mark was an extremely hard professor. He would always give us busy work and then walk out of the class. He is not very helpful. I am a B student and I am really struggling to pass this course. I would advise taking another professor if you can.,0
Wonderful prof. You will learn a lot if you pay attention. Most of the teaching comes through real world examples. I graduated 3 years ago and he still helps me out from time to time.,1
"Dr. Tonks is a really nice guy, but he isn't the best teacher. I had him for Chemistry lab and the material was really difficult and was geared towards people who had taken Chemistry before. Quizzes were impossible. Go to extra help. He's much easier to understand there.",0
I dreaded taking English but Professor Boyles keeps the class engaged and he won't bore you to death. Do the work and participate in class and you'll get an A.,1
I really enjoyed this class. It was a very informative class and Dr. Westover did a great job at explaining things. I would highly recommend him to anyone. There was a lot of work but it was all helpful to the learning.,1
"He is a wonderful human being and a brilliant professor, but DO NOT take his Research Methods 121A class. If you want to actually learn anything from him take his Social Psyc or other classes he teaches. You're on your own for 121A and he's just the grader. His instructions are unclear and he didn't seem to care about teaching this class at all.",0
"Dr. Felizzi is one of the best professors I have had. His classes are heavy on participation and things are kept at a conversational tone. He gives great feedback on assignments and prepares his students to succeed. If a student is having an issue, he makes himself available to the student and his very approachable.",1
Professor Dunham truly wants his students to grasp the course. He is respectful to his students and does not hesitate to answers questions with clear and simple explanations. It is as simple as doing the work and you will get the grade. I would definitely take a course he was instructing again. Thank you Professor for caring.,1
"He would give a list of terms to know which took about an hour to look up, but then none of them would be on the test.  A lot of tricky questions on quiz and upon asking, he would give a BS answer and then knuckle under and give me the points like he was doing me a favor.  Death by power point lecture. I had a 89.6% and he gave me a B anyway. ",0
"I had to study minimum ten hours for each exam. We are lectured for almost three hours each class, yet the test covers topics that we did not touch upon in lecture. Why doesn't Adelphi read these comments and take them into consideration?",0
"This Prof. is very funny and nice. You will need to take a lot of notes, which he will grade. He gives out a lot of quizzes after like 2 chapters. However, they are NOT hard at all. Just make sure you show up to class and take notes! He does give extra credit. I really recommend taking his class.",1
"Professor was very intelligent about her subject, however, her teaching style was not fit for such a small class. Also, textbook reading was not only a requirement, we would be required to read in depth and analyze information, almost always requiring a second or third read to answer quizzes correctly. Homework was also extremely difficult.",0
I advise only the people who are ging to devote their lives to Bio to continue with it. I got an A in Evo and am now in danger of getting a D in this damn class. Very vague about what's going to be on test and expects you to know EVERY DETAIL. It's a shame 'cause they seem like good people too.,0
Way too much work and reading for a 200 level class. He expects his students to do way more work than should be expected for a class at this level. He is very opinionated & seems to make personal vendettas against students who voice opposing thoughts. Anyone who thinks for themselves rather than just saying what the professor wants should stay away,0
"Lisa's class was very interesting, and she made all the assignments relevant to the field.  She was not very clear with any of her instructions, however, and she confused you even more when you asked for clarification.  She is very knowledgable in her field, but has a hard time teaching that knowledge in a classroom setting.",0
"just stay at home, read the book, u will be fine",0
"loved his class. he is very funny, how he even talks make you laugh. very nice teacher. however, his tests are hard. you have to study the text book to pass the tests. labs are fine. lots of homework and quizes. have to show up for every class since HW and quizes are due on each class meeting. so I had fun in his class and I was studying very hard.",1
"Grading is not clear... professor does not follow Her own rubrics or syllabus, do not take this professor",0
Kraft is a awesome professor and is a super nice guy!,1
Shes cool. She makes things easy to understand.,1
"Professor Washburn is my favorite professor, I've taken 3 of her classes. Her lectures are clear and concise. Tests are based on materials covered in class. She is caring and is devoted to child development and her students. She has worked in many areas related to CD and offers great career and life advice. Show up and you'll get a good grade.",1
"Super great lectures! He's funny and makes history entertaining and not boring. Usually history classes are difficult and textbook heavy, but he doesn't use a textbook and as long as you show up and pay attention, you'll pass. If you listen and take notes and spend like an hour studying for the test then you get an easy A.",1
Span 315 with Profesora Hess was a great class. She is very knowledgeable & also very funny & nice. She's also helpful during office hours or after class if you have any questions. Highly recommend her. ,1
Not helpful,0
"He doesn't curve, very hard class... Take his class with caution",0
Homework due almost every Friday. Will not open it back up even if you have a valid excuse. Unclear during her lectures. Tough quiz grader ( 1 question- 10 pts). Overall I didon't like her teaching style. Very unclear about test reviews!!!!! You basically have to teach yourself,0
"It is a research class. Must know how to write in active voice with Chicago style to do excel. I got a B, maybe an A- when he posts. Wonderful person who I would take again. Class made me better. Will write a good bit. No tests or quizzes. They say this is the hardest history class in the social studies program. Just apply yourself.",1
"First B I have ever gotten. Mostly because he doesn't really work with students. He turns stuff in very very late and it's hard to understand what he wants on his papers. You have to learn to take responsibility, so be prepared well before class, take super good notes, and be responsible for what you deserve. He does know history really well tho!!",1
"Ms. Pajer is a very kind lady. Only 5 essays in the semester and one is basically an annotated bib. She has a tough time with technology and Zoom. Sometimes class was boring and pointless, but in-person class had a fun dynamic. Uses peer review, rough drafts, and editing before each paper is due. Very flexible and helpful in office hours to clarify",1
"A very knowledgeable professor who conducts an engaging and relaxed course. I learned so much from him, and I really enjoyed his class. He may a bit rough around the edges but I feel his overall knowledge and clarity more than makes up for it. An overall great experience.",1
"So when I had him I thought he was a good guy, but whenever i asked serious questions, he would come back with really smart ass answers that were unnecessary. He is a fair grader but he likes to keep people between A- and B+... participation he rarely gives over a 90% and rarely over an 18/20... just to warn you, its not hard, but not so fun either",0
This is a great class. As long as you call in for the weekly conference calls he pretty much gives you the answers. Very flexible & will work with you if you need an extension on an assignment. Very responsive to emails and questions. I would take more classes from him. I didn't like law before I took this class but now I am making law my focus.,1
She is a very tough grader and is super picky on papers. Her tests are dumb as well. Her teaching is dead boring and she is very mean. Avoid at all costs.,0
I feel bad.. but she's a pretty bad teacher. I'm taking her now and I'm so excited for December to come around.. She assigns an assload of busy work just because.. she's really vague and an over all poor teacher. She will discuss essays and she's actually pretty helpful about that.. but that's pretty much it.,0
"Well she's an amazing teacher if you don't need visual examples, not just words. Other than that, she does grad hard, she's messed up a couple of times while grading (Check your tests), she's nice but when they're idiots that constantly talk in class like it's high school she doesn't do anything except tell them to be quiet.Iwishshedmakethemleave.",1
A good teacher but talks a lot. All we did every class was break into groups and answer questions about the reading. If you hate reading then do not take this class.,1
"Her projects were really fun and interesting.  she is hard on crafstmanship.  she is really nice and friendly.  tough to understand at times.  contradictory in critiques sometimes.  she grades tough, almost impossible to get an A.  it's possible but very difficult.",0
"Go to class, do the labs and practice the problem sets. Lectures based on the textbook but I've opened it less than 5 times and I'm not struggling. If you don't want to ask her questions, ask the lab instructor and you'll be fine.",1
good teacher. if you dont ask questions he wont answer them :) so just ask. a real looker aswell! that bald head. easily distracted if you dont want to do math. fantastic by my book. remind him that he is a republican an he will get pissy. great fun.,1
Dr. Hayes is a great teacher. I have looked at life different since this class and he has taught me a lot. I'm planning on taking more classes with him.,1
"Tough grader, not helpful at all. Class moves very fast pace. Unless you are already familiar with accounting do not take this class. She expects you to know what you did wrong.  I think she has been teaching to so long she forgets some people are new to the accounting field.",0
I love Professor Maida. She is such a sweet lady and the way she explains things makes it so clear. You absolutely have to do the homework as it helps in understanding the material and makes the tests a breeze. If you don't understand something then she is happy to help until you do. ,1
"Took Duane for all 3 of the courses he offers. By far the most time consuming and taxing courses I took, but also the most rewarding . He makes you work and challenges you to think outside the box. By the time I got to biochemimmunology in Med school, the stuff they taught seemed like a joke in comparison. Work hard and you'll be rewarded.",1
Professor Niu is a really nice person and her intentions are to help you but her teaching style is bad. She does not explain in a way you'll understand and may be unclear to comprehend. Do not take her if your math skills are not sharp.,0
"Brace seems nice at first look, but she's not as cute as she appears. Her lectures are VERY boring, and she never comes to class prepared. She wings half the things she says most of the time. Grading wise, it's confusing. One paper she could be an easy marker, the next it seems like she didn't even read it.",0
"Ana is by far one of the sweetest, most caring teachers at Chapman. All she wants is for her students to learn and succeed. She is very understanding and will accept late work if there is a valid reason. I would definitely recommend taking Spanish with her.",1
"I hate bio, and he made it tolerable. he is a really great person, with some even better stories...Just go to class, he gives extra credit on those rainy days when no one attends class.",1
"She is really hard to understand on her video lectures. Also, she often times works on the homework in her video lectures and gets the question answers wrong.  That's worrisome. She takes forever to upload her video lectures. Really nice person, but not the best professor. If you don't like doing HW and quizzes last minute do not take her. ",0
"Her readings are extremely boring!!!!! Bring your pillows; she will put you to sleep!!!!!! A Don Quixote groupie, her stupid brownie points are annoying, seriously how old are we? She’s a harsh grader! Avoid taking her!!!!",0
"Dont buy textbook. There are 3tests, mathxl hw/quiz grade and final exam. She really cares about her students and is willing to help. I would definitely take her again.",1
"I normally wait until the end of the semester to write these but I just cant wait: this lady is way too picky. Ive gotten into it with her a few times bc of her unfair grading. She overcomplicates everything. Claims to not have gotten my emails, has yet to fix my attendance when I was in the hospital. She does too much. Condescending & boring.",0
"Clearcut lectures that do not feel long and drawn out.  covers material solidly and with humor.  Final was twice as hard as the midterm, so you really need to do the HW and know your stuff.  There's quite a bit of memorization of material.",1
Professor Williams is really passionate about what he does. I think it was just the fact that it was a Tuesday and Thursday schedule that made this class a little bit of a drag. I can genuinely say I learned a lot in this material and I enjoyed it. Cool dude and gives many opportunities for extra credit.,1
"Great professor. The more your class participates, asks a lot of question and have discussions the easier the test are. You can't really go wrong in this class with this professor.",1
"I don't understand how he grades the tests, but it is so confusing every time I received my grade. Never told you the formate of term tests and exams. Although marks assigned on each question (multiple choice) are equally weighted, the level of difficulty has not matched the marks.",0
She is super aggressive. She has an annoying iclicker. The people that say she is nice there lying. Take someone else because she is too much. She gives sooo much work like there is no other classes but her. Aleks is supper annoying and she give so much hw that she could reduce but doesn't care. She has a lot of attitude in her emails.,0
She expects you to spend 10+ hours of extra work on the side weekly as she expects you to work as much as an engineering student. Grading is quite unjustified at times as well!,0
"She does a great job of breaking down complex ideas into simple terms. Test material comes from the in class notes, so it's a good idea to go to class. Her exams aren't hard, but there is a lot of critical thinking, so make sure you know the material. She cares about her students, she is an amazing prof.",1
"Completely all over the place, she doesn't even know what's going on. Super boring but SO easy, you could hand in a paper 3 weeks late and she probably wouldn't even notice. Doesn't really make lesson plans, you just hang out til the class is over. Attendance doesn't matter. If you want to actually learn, take someone else. ",0
DO NOT TAKE THIS MAN FOR STOR435. JUST DON'T DO IT YOU WILL HAVE TO LEARN EVERYTHING ON YOUR OWN AND HE GIVES A HOMEWORK DUE EVERY CLASS PERIOD. He cares not at all about teaching this class,0
"If you think logically and have a good math/proof based background, Dr. Buhler's explanations will make a lot of sense. Otherwise, you may have trouble understanding him. However, he is helpful if you have questions, and is willing to listen to student feedback.",1
"Maria is what I expect of a teacher, she is passionate about her field,  genuinely wants for you to succeed, and through her creativity and knowledge inspires excitement in you to learn! What is a bonus is that she will go above and beyond to help meet your learning needs, she is super funny, and puts all material into situations you can relate to!",1
"Very hard to contact! Does not answer emails and is very unclear when he does! He makes it very difficult to succeed in his class, and he lets you know that as a student! We are beneath him as students! Stay clear! Avoid at all costs!",0
Mr D is the best! lectures a lot but you dont even need to take notes because he goes over every question to the test a few days prior. homework is jusy busy work and he grades really fairly. get ready for a 10 page paper! you get to pick your topic so choose wisely. He is a lot of fun and i will be taking 2 more classes of his in the spring,1
"Overall, the class was a bit of a mess.  Although the lectures generally had to do with the readings, they often wandered off to various other topics.  Lots of reading; graded mainly by essays.  Class was interesting, prof. definitely knows about the subject.",1
"He is so cokcy and full of himself. He makes you buy the books he has wrote and read them. THEY ARE SOOOO BORING and crap that no one really cares about. If I were you I would change professors, unless you want to hear about how much money he makes and listen to him belittle other professors.",0
"A horrible professor that doesn't care whether he is speaking about opinion or facts, he simply combines the two during lectures. He is a boring lecturer that makes multiple gaffes every class and rarely answers a question straight. Avoid taking this class, you will learn nothing.",0
fun guy with a great sense of humor,1
Boring guy. FREAKS out over phones and laptops for some odd reason. Doesn't even let you take a picture of the lecture notes even though he skips through the slides with lightening speed. Attendance is mandatory so you can stare at him just talk. Unreasonable.,0
I liked Professor Abara. I found him to have a quick wit and to be a fun person. He was very helpful.,1
"TAKE HER EMOTIONS CLASS DURING WINTER OR SUMMER SESSION! During those times, she lets you take the tests open book/open note. During the regular semester it's closed book/notes and there's so much information that it would be extremely difficult. When open notes, impossible not to get an A. Papers clearly explained she gives grading guide. Easy A.",1
"This is more of a review of all of his classes between 2016-17. I have taken every class from him that I possibly could. He is the best teacher I've ever had, patient, nice, and understanding. If you don't understand or remember something, he helps you remember the answer without feeling dumb. Allows lots of extra time on homework and tests.",1
"cogan is brillant. Professor and author he is current and funny. You will have to do the work, but he is always available for help and you will be rewarded. Fair grader.",1
"Professor Fetter is one of the worst professors I have had at Butler. He is a great person and a very enthusiastic teacher but does not efficiently provide students with the material and teaching skills necessary to do well in class. He records notes and puts them online, which are just as confusing. Do not take him or Marketing Analytics (MK 384).",0
"Mi Sook was not a helpful teacher at all. I worked my butt off in this class and she did not even notice the dedication me and other students put into our work. Although she was nice at times and tried to help, she usually ended up messing up your project. Try not to get her for a teacher!",0
"She also teaches at AMU. She is Very knowledgeable and seems to care a lot about her students succeeding in her class. She promptly responses to messages and grades papers quickly. Overall, she's a fair grader and has a sense of humor!",1
Graded mainly on 3 essays. You learn nothing useful in lectures because he is too busy talking about his own life or other people's lives. You will need to read a few articles but they're all pretty pointless. He is caring and wants to be close to his students but not a great professor. You won't learn anything. Most people get Cs on essays.,0
worst teacher ever...if you ever get him drop. Good thing he is retiring soon. Biggest mistake was to take his class,0
An absolute waste of time.  Do yourself a huge favor and drop whatever class you're taking with him and wait until someone else teaches it.,0
Dee is a great teacher but has a smart mouth and is extremely rude towards some students... She makes a huge difference in students and has her picks. Her rude CAN BE VERY OFFENDING!!!,0
"I think she is a good professor, because she always responds fast to emails; she is polite, not stuck-up; she is always helpful and flexible. To be objective, I think her weak qualities are that she mostly reads most of lecture material from slide shows rather than explaining it in own words; no smile, most of the time she looks too serious.",1
"Unfair and rude. If he likes you, you will do well on his class, there were only 2 exams during the semester. Make sure you talk to him and praise him, he likes to feel important and he loves it if you tell him that you love his books.  2 students can have the same exact answers on the exam, but grades will be based on whether he likes you or not",0
"This guy's pretty boring and isn't very good at teaching. He flies through chapters but highlights what's going to be on the final for the most part. If you want to do well, you're gonna have to study a lot on your own. The textbook is your best friend but he definitely isn't!",0
Save yourself she will mess up your average.,0
"She is such a wonderful Professor!  So kind and enthusiastic about the material, it is amazing.  She really wants each student to do well and I am so glad to have taken her class.  Truly a great Professor.",1
He was a great teacher and Im really excited to have through all my four years here in uni,1
"It was an interesting class that covered interesting topics. Gildenhuys is a little hard to follow at times, but has interesting ideas as well. Definitely must stay up on the readings, and although most people didn't attend the second class of the week, you definitely should.",0
this prof's #1 goal is to make his students life a living nightmare. avoid at all cost,0
"If you're even a second late to class you're marked absent (which I get not being late, but I only had 10 minutes to get across campus to this class). It messes with your financial aid. He talks too low; you cannot hear a word he's saying unless you're in the first few rows. He reads straight from the notes, no enthusiasm..",0
Did not learn anything throughout the whole semester.,0
"Seriously awful. I cannot express. Reading actual scientific papers is a great ideas. Learning basic genetics concepts from them is not. Getting angry when being asked to put answers to review questions online is not. CREATE is not. She doesn't even lead review sessions, the LAs do, and they usually don't know the answers. Avoid at all costs.",0
"Maybe because it was online ,that this class was so hard. The professors made the tests harder than they usually are to curb cheating but that's not fair for students who don't cheat. They don't curve the class for some reason so do not count on that. Final was harder than usual so don't get blind sided.",0
"Dr. ODonnel is a terrible teacher. She believes that everyone should ""bomb their quizzes because it will help them in the long run on the tests"" so she makes them impossible. I know people who attended all of her office hours and studios for extra help and she wouldn't even raise their grades 0.56% of a point so it would go up a half letter grade.",0
"Horrible professor who is more unprepared then your dropout college freshman. Does not use D2l for any extra help. Arrives late to class every day. What he teaches in class will not be on the test nor homework. Unless you HAVE to take him, please dont and wait till another professor teaches the class.",0
"Very odd grading scale, grades off what she thinks is right instead of using the correct rubric",0
"If you are a Food and Nutrition major, the semester you take NHM 362 is going to be your hardest semester of your college career. Not because the material is hard, the professors pile on the work. It's busy work and group projects. You will be taking around 5-6 classes. Dr. Park's tests are super hard and tricky. She is a tough grader.",0
"Ms. Mancini is a life saver, definitely one of my favorite professors at NOVA.  She will go the extra mile to help a student with anything.  I took her class online, which was a little extra work because you had to teach yourself, but she was really helpful and replied to all emails quickly.  I would recommend her to anyone!",1
"Really sad to see such a great professor with some low ratings. He was very engaging, thorough, & excellent at explaining the material! If you are willing to do some independent studying and practice, you will do just great. Keep up w/ the material from the start. Don't miss clickers, don't bother w/the book. Pay attention to what he emphasizes.",1
Great teaching enviroment,1
"Let me just say that Dr. Vartanian IS THE BEST PSYCHOLOGY PROFESSOR EVER. Just take a class with her and you'll understand. But anyway, participation is not mandatory IF YOU'RE GOING TO READ THE WHOLE BOOK AND TAKE THE EXAMS. however, if you attend all lectures you'll literally never use the book. She's really lovely and passionate, Good Luck (:",1
"I think he is the best professor I have met. You don't need to worry about many things and his homework is really easy. Although I have not gotten my grade, I cannot wait to give him a good assessment!",1
"She gets real snippy and definitely has favorites. She is impatient and very negative. Amber definitely Does have favorites. Some people she jokes and laughs with, others she treats like dirt. It never ceases to amaze me how diff she'll treat one person from the next. She treated me real unpleasant, and some others too. But some poeple she loves.",0
"Nedd is such a great professor. The class was all about Provençal history, which is relevant to where we were, and he really knew the content. The projects were easy and the essay was short. I learned a lot. His awkwardness is really what makes his class interesting. Love this guy.",1
"Since all of my classes have moved online, Prof. Nadeau has really done the most as far as making herself available and adding more times to her office hours to talk to students. She lists many times throughout the week (from morning to night) to take the online exams, so if you have other classes or work you can still manage it no problem.",1
I took an online class with Scott and found him incredibly difficult to work with. There were no consistent due dates for the assignments and when interacting with him through email and forum posts I found him to be snide and condescending.,0
"Professor Gilbert was inspirational, and so good-looking too ;)",1
I have her this semester for HED 200 very frustrating does not give any material related to the lectures for exams.,0
"She is a comp. 1 professor. Comp. 1 should not be hard to pass, especially at a COMMUNITY college. She is a weird grader, very technical, and will rip your essays/summaries to shreds. You are warned.",0
"Class is not boring. Only two papers, and two written, brain-dump exams. EXTREMELY  tough grader. I was the ONLY student to get an A in his class. Extremely, extremely, extremely difficult.",1
"to the prev. rater: i suggest you pay attention in lecture as well as read the text. 1/3 questions from each...the other 1/3 are random, educated guesses needed..not too hard to pull at least a B. curve is insane",0
DR. A ROCKS,1
"He's super funny, and really cares about his students. 1190 is a difficult course in itself, but Garyen teaches well. Difficult fill in the blank quizzes every week and constant iclicker questions, but they help you stay on track with studying.",1
"she gave 19 problems for the final exam... HW due in class at 8 a.m. Though she did not take attendance, she use quizzes to drag you out of bed......",0
"Pretty heavy accent and speaks very softly. If you're not sitting in the first row, you'll be lucky to hear half of what he says.",0
"First and foremost, it takes months to have assignments graded.  You'll think you understand everything in class only to have quite a surprise after tests.  Not always approachable or accessible.  Overall I was disappointed with Shelome.",0
"She knows her stuff. But shes tough. However, she is super accessible outside of the class. She will do whatever she can to help you get a good mark.",1
"Easy.  But frustratingly, irritatingly, infuriatingly, mind-bogglingly inane classes.  If you seek to learn, do not look here.",0
"Unless your a math major..DO NOT TAKE HIM!! Over 80% of my class dropped. Its a hard subject and its compounded even more by his not realizing that we are there to learn it,not go through every single chapter, whizzing through and never picking it up. He makes constant mistaks while explaining and confuses you rather than teaching you. Waste of tim",0
"I had him for MATH 1500, he made the most informative easy to understand videos, his tests were fair, his live lectures were great , everything about him is amazing. Best prof ever!",1
"Extremely easy, learn nothing. Easiest A I've ever gotten.",0
"HORRIBLE! His essays are so hard to get a good grade on, he doesn't teach all he does is read from the book and expect us to know how to write A+ essays. I dropped his class it wasn't even worth going to. I would never take him again.",0
"Mr. Tyson is late to class everyday. He only gives tests, no homework. The information from his lectures are what you need for the test but hes late everyday so you miss out on time for info. He doesnt help you out what so ever. I ended the class with an 89.2% and I emailed him twice about something I could do to get an A & he just didnt answer",0
"Took over the summer. Did not learn anything from lecture, learned every the material on my own, but attendance was required. Spends too much time on a problem when stuck, and shows that he did not review materials before lecturing. Lab was a mess, did not explain the procedure or setup, and left us 10mins to do the lab at the end.",0
"Mrs. Chaney is fun to talk to and nice but man oh man, don't expect to understand anything that she tries to teach at all. She's all over the place with her lectures and will expect you to understand a term after she has mentioned it once. Overall I come out of class knowing less than when I went in. 10/10 wouldn't take again",0
"talks extremely fast, and won't slow down. Lab quizzes every lab day, based on previous lab. 5 exams on top of the final. Best advice if you get her- study everything, read her lectures and slides before class. Take notes off those and not her verbal lecture. She plagiarizes all her tests so Google helps. Not an easy class by any means.",0
"Before taking her class I looked on here and she had a good rating but now It's lowered I can see why since I'm in the class and it's terrible, she's such a hard grader and doesn't explain work well I'm always confused, and I didn't find out my grade till the end of the semester, now I know who not to take for enc1102.",0
She was a great teacher! There are assignements in class to bring up grades. She gives extra credit opportunity for every test that you do at home. She gives a study guide for every test and the test is exactly from the guide! A very good teacher who will help you in any way possible!,1
"She's ridiculous, we spend every day hearing Dr. Smith telling us we need to work harder. We have AT LEAST 4 pages of homework every day. Our mid term was three, three page papers, an interview, a 8 semester course diagram, and 6 pages of the workbook. UI100 is supposed to be a blow off class, and it is in every other UI100. Not this one.",0
Very annoying. Gives zeros on papers for little things such as not having your date right. You can redo them but she takes forever to grade. Boring lectures and gets mad if you dont pay attention. Would not recommend,0
Made us believe turning in review packets would give us 5 points on each test that they were turned in for and apparently this is not the case because my final grade is 6% lower than it should be.,0
She does not give feedback on what is missed on homework or tests to be able to study as well as doesn't even release grades unless begged for by students. Extremely unorganized for class and in general. If you have a question don't bother emailing her as she doesn't respond for days at a time. In short don't waste your time w/ her for any class.,0
"The ASL class had a pleasant and quiet atmosphere. We didn't speak and really immersed ourselves in the language. The way she went about teaching without speaking wasn't hard to follow at all, like you may think. I would take the next ASL class with her again if I had the opportunity to do so.",1
"He is a good teacher, but hard to understand. You have to take good notes and find alternative notes otherwise you might get lost. ",0
"Assignments are not specific. Whenever I ask her a question, her response is ""refer to the assignment."" Poor grammar that makes the assignments confusing. Posts assignments in modules that are not due that week. Would not recommend this teacher to anyone. I've taught myself more about communications than she's taught me. Teacher's Rate: 0",0
"Dr. Lanning was very straight forward in what he expected his students to understand for his exams. He was clear and concise during his lectures and utilized every portion of them by providing information pertaining to his exams and also what he thought was important to know about for future bio courses, pretty funny as well.",1
One of the most interesting history classes I've taken and she really cares about the stuff shes teaching.  She is really enthusiastic and spends alot of time with you outside of class if you want it.,1
Paul Sanfran is an overall great teacher!!! He has a great understanding of technology and it shows through his teaching!!!!!!,1
"Kato sensei is great! I agree with the most recent review. She's cool and caring and she was always available to talk to, ask questions and go over work. The class atmosphere was good, everyone made friends and we learned at a steady pace. Tests were always fair. The beginning can be a bit hard if you have never learned any Hiragana, but it was ok!",1
Mrs. DePinto is a true gem. She is truly a great teacher I have learned a lot from her this semester. I am so glad to have taken her class. She expects hard work from her students.,1
"Very arrogant teacher. Goes over one example per concept and still fails to clearly explain it. Ridiculous homeworks, pointless project, and impossible exams.",0
"Mrs. Mudrick-Smiley was a great prof I had at DCCC.  As much as I hate English and all its ""to-the-point"" grammar, she made it fun and interesting, esp with the movie we watched with ""Boy in Striped Pajamas"". I'll be forever thankful for the great recommendation she gave me that helped me get into Temple. Take her if you want a good English class.",1
"I truly enjoyed going to her class I learned so much in such a short amount of time in this class. She makes her classes fun so that you don't want to miss it, She is very educated and motivated me to want to succeed not only in her class but in all my classes.  I wish that she taught more classes I would love to take her again!!",1
"Terri is very nice and is always willing to help her students succeed. She is very personable and extends a hand whenever you need help. Her class was manageable. I would suggest reading the power points in depth as they help you prepare for exams. In labs, you have stations and it can be difficult to get your work done so plan your time properly.",1
"Lindsay has had a sassy and difficult classroom to deal with this semester and I think she is doing as well as anyone could under these circumstances. The class is not easy, but it is because she holds her students to high standards and wants to see us do our very best.",1
Very knowledgeable and nice manner.  Participation marks are not based on attendance or participation; they will coincide with your other grades.  More difficult than expected even with his help.,0
"I had selected this teacher for my ECO 2023 but, the first two classes with this woman were enough to realize that she was a lost case for the class. She is rude and arrogant. I'm glad I  trusted my guts and dropped the class. After reading this reviews, I see I was not wrong.  Avoid her as much as you can.",0
"Dr. J is the woman.  Seriously, I wish she were my mom.",1
Loved her. She is very kind.,1
"Very enthusiastic and helpful in class! On the other hand, there is lots of reading material, like a new book every week, and the majority of them are quite dense and are not very well known books.",1
"He is way too into the subject which makes the class more difficult. He wants everyone to enjoy the class as much as he does, which is very difficult considering many people take this class as a pre-requisite as an easier math class. He does not use the book except for maybe one or two assignments. Tests are not like study guide. Would not recomm.",0
"This guy is super funny. He is easy on the eyes too and he is a great professor. Beware, he doesn't look at you in the eye. Don't know why.",1
"The class was very interesting but other than a paper and a couple of news article homework assignments, the only grades are tests. The tests are hard and a fourth of the questions don't relate to what's on the study guide. It is a fun class however, I just wish you got more than 1 point for attending class.",1
"Jim is really nice and cares so much. But he doesn't really teach. He reads from the book and has you do activities from it. He has a lot of knowledge about social work, but only shared personal experiences a few times. The grade was a couple tests, book assignments, and assessments of a classmate.",1

This professor is doing nonsense thing! She asked me to rewrite my essay twice just because she didn't tell want I need to achieve at once! Now I have less than a week to write a final essay! It is killing me!,0
"Attendance isn't mandatory but he doesn't upload any of the powerpoints. A LOT of reading, he assigned 5 books for one semester and we read them all. He grades on a curve but he's really rude. You're not allowed to eat in class, use the restroom or leave early. I would never recommend his class to anyone. Only took it because it was available.",0
"Melissa's lectures were informative but very lengthy. A lot of the time she would spend class giving a tutorial on how to use Adobe Premier but would get upset when we followed along on our computers because we weren't ""paying attention."" I feel like her class was better pre-covid. Overall she was just alright, do the work and you'll pass.",1
She was a guest lecturer for our class and she was awesome!!! She's young and so funny! Her class was more discussion based rather than powerpoint. I learned a lot from her lecture-it had great content. She was great and I hope she starts teaching more!,1
she is the best,1
"She is not helpful at all; Probably one of the hardest teachers Ive ever had. Studying, taking notes, and looking over h/w is not helping. I'm still enrolled in this class because I have no choice.  She does not give extra credit or curve your grade. Take another teacher if you can you will regret it unless you're good in math and word problems.",0
"He is there to help you learn physics, but also will not spoon-feed the subject to you. He will help you understand how it all works, then expect you to read some at home, and do homework . He is not mean, he expects great things from you because he knows that every person is brilliant. Be there in class, organize well, pay attention, and ask ?'s .",1
GREAT LADY!!!!! So helpful you won't believe it. More than a teacher she felt like my friend throughout every counseling session. She really has an awesome and helpful personality.,1
"This professor is horrendous. I emailed him and messaged him through canvas multiple times and did not receive a single response throughout the entire quarter. Course load was ridiculous, spent at least 4 hours a day on this class to keep a 4.0. He would 100% be unemployed if his wife was not head of the Psychology department. Avoid at all costs.",0
"She's really intelligent, but takes English way too seriously than it is. Made us stay in class for the entire 1HR 15MIN for just an English class, was quite annoying. Quite a tough grader, and does not accept work late. If you want to take a more relaxed class to get an easy A, definitely not hers. Don't go to class late, she'll mark you down. ",1
"Good suggestions on color mixing, paint handling. Poor management of class time. Critiques went way over; she stayed later to finish & implied that anyone who didn't stay was not committed. As a single parent w child care obligations I had no choice but to leave, although I was hugely committed. Left a bad taste, insensitive, elitist.",0
"Nutrition being a nursing class is tough as it is, but this professor turns it into rocket science. Don't expect any lectures, powerpoints, and or anything other than your textbook to get through this class. She is quick to respond and quick to grade but the tests are impossible, and you're 100% on your own. Would never take her again.",0
I hate her teaching style. She uses MyMathLab.com and she expects everyone to know what they're doing. The homework is pretty hard. If you take this class you might as well sign your life over to math homework because it takes HOURS..,0
Overall one of the best professors I've had for any class.  Loves the subject and can teach it well.  Student participation is crucial but he makes it interesting.  Do the homework and you'll get an A.,1
"ATP was a great professor. Funny and engaging. Definitely have to work for your grade. Attendance is not mandatory but Iclicker points are in every class (50 total for semester) so if you skip, you lose points. Super helpful and always willing to answer questions. Highly recommend this class. Don't buy the textbook but DO buy lecture notebook.",1
"She's a sweet lady, but very quirky. She has a very specific way of grading assignments, and if you don't follow it exactly she'll take off points. It's easy criteria, she's just super picky about it. I didn't feel like I had the freedom to really get better as a public speaker because she forced us to use such a plain mold for speeches.",0
"Very difficult to understand due to accent, does not know how to explain things well at all, could have been an easy A but because I barley learned anything from lecture I did not do as good as I could have done",0
"Moves pretty fast through lectures and doesn't allow electronic devices, so prepare to do a lot of note-taking. Understands most of us aren't stats major so she jokes a lot to keep it light. Tests are usually 5 questions each but lots work but write down EVERYTHING you know, she gives points just for trying even if answers are wrong. Enjoyed her!",1
"I had Mi-Sook for the new module-oriented foundation courses for Art majors. The thing I disliked the most was unclear directions-- changed from class to class, and if she misspoke, she would act like that's what she had been saying all along. Also, she was hard just to be hard, not to help. She generalized students, didn't feel like she cared.",1
"Anderson is absolutely fantastic. He requires you to do most of the work outside of class time, but he is definitely willing to help you if you just ask. He is by far one of my favorite professors at LSU.",1
"She gave me a B in the class, and I have no idea why.  Not that B is a bad grade...but I made A's on all of the assignments and I participated in the discussions.",0
"Dr. Walker is amazing, her teaching style allows the content to stick. She relates the work to real life experiences. She grades very fairly and is always willing to work with you as long as you are acting putting in the work. to top it all off she is willing to listen to any problems you might have school related or not. she is all around amazing!",1
awful awful awful.  could not understand her at all. she goes way too fast. knows subject so well but does not know how to present it to students. DO NOT TAKE HER FOR FINANCE.,0
Graded on a 1000 pt. scale with 2 major assignments; one worth 300 and the other worth 500. You have two chances at each to improve your grade if you did poorly on the first. He did not get my 500 pt. assn. graded until the qtr was completed. Did not get a chance to reattempt 500 pt assn.,0
It shows that this was her first semester teaching a course by herself.,0
"Professor Bamford is a fantastic professor here at QU. Caring, committed, and always willing to help her students, she is one of the best professors I have had at QU.",1
Highly recommend this professor. He makes the class very engaging and fun and you get to learn a lot.,1
"I really struggled in his class. I only missed a few classes and still had issues understanding what he was teaching. You can tell that he knows the information, it's just sometimes confusing to understand the way he explains things. He always offered to help me in and out of class, but I found it easier to get a tutor.",0
Scatterbrained & unorganized.,0
"Crazy Austrian Economist from the University of Vienna.  Although he knows his stuff, he is extremely dry.",1
"I've taken many online courses, and really do prefer them, but Taking this class was a mistake. If you struggle with math, please please please look for another professor or wait a semester. Your GPA isn't worth it!",0
"Okaaaaaay let's see ... Whatever I'm gonna say I can't describe this professor. He is amazing, great, one of the best professors I ever had. I always like to bother him with my questions lol, he always helps. You better take his class if u guys see his name. You will get an A if u listen to his comments on your presentations. Take him��Take him��",1
"Prof. Victor is brilliant.  She knows her stuff and is always 100% prepared, as you should be every time you walk into her class.  If you want to merely get by, don’t take her class.  On the other hand, if you are willing to work, the knowledge you will gain from her class is priceless.  I am honored to have had the opportunity to learn from her.",1
"I really enjoyed this class, but it is a lot of work over the summer. The textbook is thick and you have to commit to reading or working on an assignment everyday (which should be expected.) I enjoyed her class and thought that it was very easy, but it might be even easier during a regular semester. Overall, I would recommend her class!",1
Avoid signing up for him. Run as fast as you can!,0
He was the easiest professor and the most honest. He always tells you what to expect in the midterms and final. He gives handouts which basically outlines the class lecture. You don't need to go to class BUT he gives good examples that can help for the exams. Key ideas and examples are his thing. Not boring if you listen attentively. Really chill.,1
"A LOT of hw and classwork, test was open note and project was over the course of a couple of months. If you can keep up for the first month the rest of the class will be a breeze. However, Morris is perhaps one of the most vanilla boring lecturers I've had. Bring earbuds to class.",0
"Class is easy and prof. is friendly. Teaches off of the powerpoint slides that are posted before class, 4 homework problems each week. Exams are not difficult plus you are allowed a 2-sided cheat sheet.",1
Please do not take with him. he is the worst ever and ever. He does not know how to teach. he just copy powerpoint from another professor and show in the class. he does not even know whats in the powerpoint because that was other professor slide. worst worst worst. you will regrett after middle of the class. do not take with him.,0
this class was difficult for me. The instructor is not very clear when he gives lectures in class plus he gives a lot of quizzes of what he talked earlier in class. Not an enjoyable class.,0
"she is really funny and keeps class fun. she does a lot of group work. tests are really easy she gives you the questions before the test and half of those are on the actual test (multiple choice). topic paper is your choice, easy grader. def take for an easy A.",1
Dr. Vendetti was  an awesome professor. I learned a lot about Evolution in just 5 weeks. This class was not hard at all. Just study your notes and the study guides she provides and you're guaranteed an A.  She was such a caring professor and passionate about the subject. The only thing I disliked about the class was that it is not a semester long.,1
no.,0
"I would never recommend Dr. Yang. She is condescending and rude. Unnecessary amount of work. You write, take, and grade your own tests that take HOURS. She is very particular and if things are not done her way, she is judgemental and will tell you you're wrong. Struggles to give compliments to her students or make them feel worthy! Avoid!!!",0
"WORST TEACHER BY FAR, HELLA CONTRIDICTIONS. picks on students unmercifully. grades on a ""what I say goes basis"" meaning if you have a similar ALSO CORRECT answer he will not count it . gives quizzes with no clarity on content  or chapter randomly. ""the quizzes can be on anything we've covered during the semester"" -Cage and he doesn't tell you what",0
"Even though she was an online professor, she taught the material well and very concise! Easily accessible when I needed a question answered, very straightforward materials/tests, light but comprehensible coursework. Well rounded professor in general!",1
"Lectures are always BORING. Learned almost nothing from her specifically, but other professors teaching the class were helpful. She speaks slow but it doesn't help at all. There's just too much information. Definitely read the book and all the suggested readings and you should be fine. I would try to avoid taking any of her classes though.",0
"The classes are extremely slow, heavy, and redundant. Her teaching method is very confusing unless you ask specific questions and get the answer youre looking for. Resources on blackboard are all over the place so it will take you a while to find the correct resource for the assignment youre working on.",0
"When everybody in the class got a bad grade on the first exam, he said do better. Not very respectable and cannot explain things very well. You learn mostly through the online homework.",0
I took her online class. They layout was very unorganized and confusing. the dates are wrong in the weekly assignment folder so I got a few zeros cause she never changed the dates from her previous classes. ALOT of reading. expects you to know everything already and if you dont expects you to learn it on your own. if never taken anat before dont,0
"She's really sassy sometimes, but not in a funny way. She seems to clearly have students that she prefers and kind of comes across as fake caring.",0
"Mollie is awesome! She gives you real world examples and makes the material relevant. She likes to talk about her kids. She is a funny, nice teacher! Class was not difficult if you just go to it. I used to book twice and got a B if that gives any point of reference.I hope to have more classes with Mollie.",1
"If you're not an accounting major, this class likely won't be very fun. It's a lot of work, sometimes pretty straightforward sometimes not. If you don't put in the time you won't do very well. Mr. Mac's cryptic comments in class don't really help. My only beef is that while he claimed not to have trick questions on tests, they appeared frequently.",0
By far the best teacher I've ever had. Tests are from lectures (so record them). Do lab questions before going to lab. If you're ahead of the game she will appreciate that. Always ask a lot of questions. She's extremely smart & a very impressive teacher. I learned so much from her. Highly recommend for future RNs. You won't regret taking her class.,1
"Shes the worst. Had a hard to understand accent. Could only meet outside of class before or after class. Wont answer emails only directs you to syllabus. Attendance is mandatory,she only takes doctor notes. You will need to read the chapter and take notes from lecture to pass. The map part of the class is the hardest almost everyone failed it.",0
"Tough grader, Little feedback, and has no filter",0
"Probably one of the easiest classes I've taken, ever. As long as you're able to complete all of your assignments on MyMathLab, and partake in the discussion boards, ON TIME, you will pass this class. She has a strict-late work policy.  Also, if you're passing the class with an 85% or higher, you're exempt from taking the final exam ",1
"Phil is a good teacher. He is funny and has a lot of knowledge about agriculture. He can come off as a little snobby. Overall a good lecturer. Easy class, however, there is a 5-page research paper, but he grades super easy.",1
I have taken this professor for all 3 of my science classes for nursing. Since thats what Im majoring in. She is very caring and easy. I am glad I have taken her for all those classes she makes the material easy to understand.,1
"Lauren is a completely unfair marker. She says one thing and does another. Lectures how exams are not meant to trick you, yet every question was a joke. Once she has her mind made up on your mark she wont change it regardless of whether it was fair or not. Although the class looks interesting AVOID her a prof for any future classes.",0
"Best teacher ever!! Gave study guides and they were practically the test!! If you want an A, take Mrs. V; she's awesome!(:",1
"Very nice man, but this class was awful. He assigned YouTube videos instead of teaching and yet gave the hardest exams and homework I have ever had to do. Questions were unclear and made to trick you. He takes off an unnecessary amount of points for small errors. In office hours he is not helpful and says that it is for you to figure out. Run!!",0
Absolutely awesome professor. Very helpfull and has a very creative teaching style.,1
Take this teacher at your own risk!! Day 1: 35+ students Day of Final: 7 students total. his teaching doesnt make sense and he Laughs at his own jokes. His class is based on  eassays. Students dropped the class because they knew he wasn't going to pass anyone.,0
Probably the worst teacher ever.  There was no point to even goto class except on Friday's for the quizzes because all he did was read off the Power Point slides and then post them on Angel.  Tests were so long for 50 minutes.  What a dick.,0
"I LOVE Kathleen. She is an amazing effects animator who is still very active in the field. Type in her name in IMDB if you're curious. She has a tendency to talk quite a bit, but her lectures and advice are really helpful in the long run. Her figure drawing class is also INCREDIBLE. My favorite class at CSUCI so far.",1
Prof. Ochs runs a fairly simple class. You have a reading assigned for every class and she gives you notes on the reading during class. Actually doing the readings is not all that mandatory. Showing up to class also isn't mandatory but the class becomes a lot harder if you don't because you really need the notes to do all the writing assignments.,1
"Professor is nice, kind, and informative. however shes not on time with anything, always adjusting her schedule of the syllabus changing dates for assingments due. talks about her jobs and is constantly asking for feedback which pushes time back for assignments due. Heavy grader for a class to improve for poor writing. DONT TAKE HER!",0
"I took the hybrid class.  He kept everything up to date on D2L and sent e-mail reminders when an assignment was due.  The assignments are easy to get full credit on.  The tests are matching and multiple choice, but he grades on a curve.  Be sure to study the book and the notes for the tests.",1
"She was always very vague about what she wanted. She expected you to use canvas a lot and from what I could remember would never give you a heads up with something was coming up, I understand that it's our responsibility, but Eng101 is one of the 1st classes you take in college and I didn't know how to use it right away. A heads up would've been n",0
So caring and kind. You can tell how much she loves what she does and it shines through her. I had been in the hospital for a while and she checked on me constantly and was there for me when I needed to get caught up. She tells you exactly what will be on her tests. If you fail this class it is completely your fault. She gives multiple chances.,1
Extremely unclear instructions. Way too much work.,0
"He's OK, knowledgeable but like some others pointed out a little too frank which comes off intimidating. I'd take him again if I had to. Class is way to easy once you understand the way it grading, quizzes, etc works. ",1
"Great Professor, she is a little off sometimes and tough on presentations but overall a caring professor. I would recommend actively participating and doing all the work. easy A",1
"I love this man. Helpful and incredibly sweet. Once you take his intelligence as adorably awkward instead of superficial, you'll appreciate his teaching more. You actually learn how to use the book you spent tons of money on and use those skills for other classes. And his sense of humor is priceless!",1
"This class prompted me to watch a lot of really good films that I wouldn't have watched otherwise. However, there's a good amount of writing involved and the instructions are not always clear. My biggest gripe is when he took points off my assignment because he didn't think I actually watched the assigned films.",0
"You either hate her or love her. either way an entertaining class. You learn to laugh at yourself and at her quirks...she also has the most experience you will ever find in a prof in canada who is a playwrite. i loved it and am takin a second course, but mostly for the humor of it all.",1
DIDNT LEARN ANYTHING!!!>..she thinks she's the smartest person on earth. With her water bottle and fake smiles....She will fail you ..if you sit and understand everthing...u need to stay after school and suck her toes just to get a D,0
don't take her ever . she is not A PROFESSOR  i took her 240 with her last semester. i recommend you to drop her class if you register her class. Take another professor,0
"Professor Galan is awesome! He is laid back, understanding and very nice. Easy to talk to! Gives extra credit for having the Texas quarter in TXHIS class. I am not good with dates and history but will receive an A+ in his class. Try to get his class!",1
"Although his lectures may be kind of boring at times, he is extremely knowledgeable in the field of cognitive neuroscience and breaks up lecture with funny personal stories and interesting video clips. His lectures are far more engaging than most other professors",1
"She is the best professor ever. If you do your essays and assigned journals, trust me you will get easy A !!! I love her, she made me start loving writing the essays. the class is so much funny, she is a very modern professor, you will have a lot of fun in class. Having problems with essays? always there for you whenever you need her. ",1
Jallen is mad chill and easy. Just do the assignments and you'll do well on exams. Grades leniently on group projects and is flexible with late work. Take him for sure!,1
"Only problem I had with her was due dates. Assignments would have due dates for before the class had even started (late start). Drop boxes would close before the due date, then you wouldn't get credit even if you had it finished on time. I found communicating with her not helpful. I'm sure she's great in person, online isn't her strong suit maybe.",0
"I finished this class with about 107% She gives lots of extra credit! Tests are multiple choice with study guides, sometimes even open notes, Homework was just typing key word definitions, Had to do one group presentation + one scientific report, But overall the course was very easy, she was super sweet, was there for help when you needed her.",1
Hes a great prof. for high level math courses! He really possesses the ability to take confusing concepts and break it down in a way that any student can understand! He gets a bad wrap for being somewhat monotone but hes Hilarious the more your class engages the better! Do your homework & attend class and theres no way you can fail! Thanks Adam!,1
Awesome online lectures. Always responds to emails in a timely manner. Fair grader. Before every exam he gives a practice test then holds zoom meeting to go over every problem and answers any thing you are still unsure of. If you put in the time work you will pass this class.,1
"I didn't learn anything in this class, really boring especially his stories and his way of teaching.  This should be the students class.  Can't give any feedback.  Where is his learn unlearn and relearn, not if you haven't learn anything in the first place. Not recommended to take this class.",0
"Her class is pretty hard especially the exams. There are 3 big exams during the semester, no final. She did change the grading scale of the 2nd one because everyone sucked at it. If you have to take her class without choice like I did, be fully prepared with the exams and spend as much time as you can to go over the lecture notes and exercises.",1
"I loved the readings for this class and the paper assignments had a nice amount of freedom, often allowing students to choose between multiple readings. Feedback on papers was always extremely helpful and on point. Grading felt fair. Reading was manageable to light. Class discussions sadly got stale rather quickly and I wish there was more variety.",1
Very good instructor willing to help any way she can makes the info clear cut and easy to understand,1
"The lectures seem easy, but the tests are very challenging. He is a very smart professor, but he assumes that his students are just as smart as he is. He makes fun of you for asking questions that he thinks are ""something we should know by now"". I would not take him again.",1
"Me and all my classmates loved taking Paula's class. She is an amazing woman who really cares about her students. She can tell when you're taking advantage of her kindness though. Made public speaking super easy, and made us all feel comfortable. Gives great feedback and explains assignments in a very clear way.",1
Lots of reading but the book is interesting enough,1
Silva is very difficult to reach outside of office hours and doesn't respond in a timely manner to any emails sent to her. She can be unclear regarding the level of participation she wants. The online homework is very heavy as well as the tests. Do not attempt this class without a textbook. Weekly online discussions mandatory,0
She's very understanding if you do't catch on to something in class. She'll stay back after class to go over a homework problem with you so you understand.  homework is online and easy to get 100% on. It's an easy A ! Take her!!!!,1
Awesome professor. Her experience in the law enforcement community shows. She brings real world events and her police stories into her lecture. Class went by really fast. If you pay attention in class you will be fine,1
"Great guy, whose very funny. Material is interesting and lectures are thorough. His tests are extremely tough. Make sure you study alot and talk to him about anything you are uncertain about.",1
"Kim's lectures are not mandatory. Most ASA classes, if not most classes at Davis, are synchronous and mandatory. I suggest emailing a professor before you take their class to see if their class is mandatory or not. Kim is very caring and understandable and will grant an extension if you need one, whether it's mental health-related or COVID related.",1
"I had an amazing time with this professor! Made everything less complicated. She explained the material well, always responded to email , and is a fair grader .She is a great professor would gladly take again.",1
"Basically a self-teach class. She reads straight off the slides and is very unorganized. There is a quiz after every chapter, she speeds through every chapter so the quizzes are every other day. She says she's always available but has never once responded to my emails. Didn't learn much either. Just study and you're likely to pass.",0
"She is a boring, monotonous, condescending ""teacher"". She was very unhelpful. One of the worst ""teachers"" I have ever had. Avoid her classes at all costs.",0
Super interesting lecturer,1
Boring class. Simnet test can be very difficult at beginning. Double check before submitting. Easy A if you study and complete all work.,0
"This course was very interesting and Dr. Flannery gave a ton of resources for it. There was a lot of work for a one credit hour, week long course, but some days were lighter than others and I was able to work ahead so that the final day wasn't so jam packed. There is a paper and a final for this class but it was not outrageously hard.",1
This class if full of daily lectures and constant homework assignments. Dr. Steadman is a cool guy but not super flexible on deadlines and outside circumstances. If you pay attention in class and do your work it is an easy A.,1
Attended 3 weeks of lecture and then resorted to the homework website to learn everything. Reads out of the book and is very hard to follow. I took this class online and his hand writing was unreadable.,0
"Professor Wu is a very nice guy, he allows cheat sheets on tests and doesn't have too many exams. Be sure to put everything on your cheat sheet! His lectures are hard to understand what's relevant, and for his lab projects make sure you attend those classes because his instructions are vague at best.",1
"Prof Galan is a great professor.  He really knows what he is talking about, loves questions, very willing to help. Takes attendance, if you show up for class but are still struggling, this will play a big factor on your grade. Reviews for Exams are helpful, and you write 4 papers in the semester (2 on films watched in class and 2 on books)",1
Very funny but a horrible teacher. He does not teach just tells you what to look at in the book. Very messy on the board and jumps from one thing to another. I cried after every test but huge curves if the whole class does bad. I'd say if you have a good background in physics you'll be fine but if you're shaky with the stuff don't take.,0
Doesn't know what he's doing. Disorganized for every class,0
"Don't get me wrong this class is not hard at all. If you do all the chapter reviews, online quizzes and papers you will get an A in the class. The midterm and final is easy. I never went to class because the professor was mono tone and not engaging at all.",0
Makes it tough for a 100 level class.,0
Gives really good lectures but the test will hurt you.,0
"he was a terrible teacher. honestly worst i've ever had. leaves you to teach yourself the course. he would overload you with homework and never even went over it and was always in a bad mood. he told my class, ""guys i could be doing something better than be wasting my time here"" but isn't it your JOB to be here??? definitely do not recommend him!!",0
"WORST EXPERIENCE EVER! It is nearly impossible to study for his exams because he makes up his own questions in the most unconventional way possible. He rushes through most of his lectures. If you want to feel dumb, please take this course with professor Chu. He will make sure of that. (Word of advice, if you do take his course, STUDY EVERYTHING!)",0
"IDK why she's a professor to start off. She Can Not Teach!! If you ask her a question she is unable to answer because she doesn't know herself. Take my advice and avoid her at all cost or you will regret it. She also teaches Auditing, do yourself a favor and do not take her!",0
"She was rude, you had to teach a lot of the content yourself, not very helpful in general.",0
"Extremely unreasonable. Unwilling to help students, spends most of her class giving long lectures that aren't related to the syllabus. Whoever reads this, please don't choose her as your professor.",0
"TA (English is her 2nd language) does all of the grading. Two papers totaling 15-20 pages plus the midterm and final.  The material is not hard, but the grading is ridiculously strict. The other section of this course had an open note-online final, where as ours was 35% of our final grade. Way harder than it needs to be! GPA killer",0
You have to read a chapter of the textbook and a whole play each week and have weekly quizzes. There are also 2 critiques and a group final project. She takes attendance everyday and it does affect your grade. She is a hard grader on the group project. I would recommend taking a different class to fulfill your fine arts credit.,0
"Had Rick for 260 as well as an online course - He's never failed to be condescending and rude when asked a question, especially if he thinks the student should know the answer. Doesn't know how to teach the material in his class and gets upset when the entire class performs poorly on an exam that was written like he wanted everyone to fail. Avoid!.",0
"Lisa is GREAT! She has a really good knowledge of the French language and really wants everyone to be successful. We did fun activities, ate food, learned the culture and the language. I totally recommend taking her class!",1
"Dr. Vohs was a great professor.  He was very helpful when I needed him, and I thought he explained difficult concepts very well.",1
I recommend taking his class. He is the bomb dot com. I took his class for 092 and math 100. Attendance is a must and you must do the work. He cares about his students and if you need help he will help you. I would take him again.,1
Don't waste your time going to his office hours. He won't hep you and will tell you to learn  it yourself. Better off memorizing the textbook than doing his assignments. Will tell you to drop out if you don't pass the midterm (over 55% will fail it). Breaks the rules every year.,0
"I loved Adelle's classes. She has such an interesting past and is very involved in the field of Forensic Psychology. The lectures were interesting and had awesome information provided. I enjoyed showing up for class and looked forward to readings. Grading was fair, the quizzes were easy - studying for midterm and final is essential!",1
"If you arent good in math, stay far away from her. She is more of a bully than a teacher, she was not helpful at all, I will never take her again.",0
This professor is the worst. Does not care if you understand the material. Reads to himself instead of teaching. Often times made so many mistakes. Tough grader to the max. Overall does not take the time to teach and expect the student to pass. I took his summer Chem 131 and it destroyed my GPS. DO NOT TAKE his class. You've been warn.,0
When it comes to tests this guy does not know what he is doing. His review sheets have little to nothing to do with his tests.,0
Bliss is the most helpful teacher ever. Knows what he's doing and is there for you no matter what. Has fun and unique ways to teach all his classes and to integrate real-life situations and anecdotes. He genuinely cares =),1
"Vance makes it seem easy when he lectures, but you are totally unprepared for the test unless you thoroughly read the book. And, with the way he teaches this class, they should make the income tax class a prerequisite. If you don't understand income tax really well, it will be hard to get above a B in this class, no matter how much you study.",1
Dr.T gives out study guides that are very identical to the actual exams. Practice makes perfect tough. He explains the lessons really well so take good notes. He is the best math professor that I had at Spelman!,1
"Great professor! Very interesting; obvious that he really cared about the subject (novels from the modern period) and the students. Gave a variety of assignments which really helped to learn the material in different ways, leading to deeper learning. Very fair grader, and always willing to help if you need it. Gave extensive and helpful feedback!",1
"Worst teacher ever! takes weeks and weeks to grade! SLOW to answer emails. Doesnt teach at all, and the sad part is: LoneStar college does not provide a choice. LoneStar college needs to fire her and get someone else to teach because she is useless!",0
Terrible teacher. She puts you down.,0
"RUN. Nice demeanor, however she is new to teaching. Requires odd-ball assignments no one has ever done or heard of. Does not really know what she is doing at times. WRITING INTENSIVE!! Group project/PowerPoint, textbook reading, 20+ pg *purchased* case studies, and Memos all expected all to be worked on at the same time.",0
"He tries but not enough. His study guides are useless. Most of this class i taught myself. It was really harsh exams, you can pass it if you get good grades in hw and quizzes but even there you will need at least 50 in the two midterms. Advice if you have to take it from him, do not even try to fight with him. No extra credit so dont even ask.",0
"Professor Smith is one of my favorite professors at UCSD! He literally wrote Constitutional Law for Dummies - there is no better professor to take a course about constitutional law. His courses are detailed and difficult, as he teaches them like he teaches is law school courses. If you are a POLI major, I would highly recommend!",1
She is honestly a great professor and you should get an A as long as you listen in class and take notes. Tests are all based off a list of key terms and she makes sure to go over every one on the list. Attendance isn't mandatory unless it's Friday (still go to class). 2 tests and they are easy. 5/10 250 word discussion prompts due and they are easy,1
No extra credit. His test are worth 70% of your grade. doesn't drop lowest test. Doesn't explain things and is very rude.,0
"PRACTICES UNFAIR GRADING.  If you want to be success in ECON 2105, do not take him.  Boldt is not a good professor.",0
I ddin't learn much.,0
"Listen to me people, DO NOT let the reviews/comments discourage you from taking his class. He prepares you very well for what you're going to experience in the advertising world. Yes he's a tough grader, but he's also incredibly reasonable and understanding. Great lectures, great feedback, great class! He's very straightforward and you'll learn!!",1
"Worst class I've ever taken. She was not a good teacher, and had a horrible TA who she let control almost all of our grade. When we complained that the TA was giving us horrible grades with no explination she just said ""you will have to take that up with him."" Horrible teacher, horrible class. I'm a straight A student and withdrew. WAST OF TIME.",0
"Professor Onyiahs accent is difficult to get used to, so it definitely requires active listening on your part. (I would recommend seeing a tutor.) He genuinely cares about the success of his students and encourages questions. Hes not the greatest teacher, but hes a nice guy and will meet you halfway as long as you put forth the effort.",0
"Interesting class, really funny prof.",1
"Very interesting material.  Prof clear in explanations, gives numerous examples.  Full lectures, not much time to ask questions.  Gives minimal extra credit.  Read chapters, attend class, study, easy A.",1
Dr Barnes is very nice and I enjoyed the way she taught class with examples and stories. Lectures were engaging and she made it fun. Speeches arent too bad but she grades very harsh. I would suggest going to her office hours to clear up guidelines and to have her look over outlines. Overall great professor for this class.,1
"The best thing about Prof Davis is that she is an easy A. However, her interaction was extremely minimal. Her feedback was seriously lacking, and she does not write her own lecture notes. It was clear that a lot of students did not understand basic concepts of deviance even in the last week of class!",1
Made this French III class harder than it needed to be in terms of us adding to previously gained knowledge. She could take more time in explaining grammar. But she was okay in general. Going from Mme Vitaglione in French 2 to her was more difficult than it should have been if the point was to have people leave being fluent in French.,0
"Terrible teacher. Rude, condescending, hypocritical. Does not know her own materials. Could not answer questions on her own test. Has blatant equality issues. Would not take her classes again.",0
This prof made me dislike Economics... lecture is extremely boring.,0
Tough but you learn learn learn!!!,1
"Dr. Jones is the best professor I have ever had! If you are willing to do the work (which is worth it) she will help you in any way she can. She has an endless knowledge base in the subject area of English Education. She makes every topic interesting and gives great resources for future teachers! Love, Love, Love her!",1
"What a guy! Cool head! Smart phys. ed. professor, been around the block a time or 2 or 3 or 4.knows his s#*! When it comes pitchin! Only 1 thing... he's a Cubby fan!! oooooo Jus kiddin Great Coach!!! Keep on Truckin! Newport! Rock On !!!",1
Very rude.,0
"Great, Great Teacher. The Comp sci dept is the best. KC is easy going and fun to be with. sometimes she gets a little over the top but you leard to deal with it. She loves everybody and will take walk ins anytime of the day in her office.",1
"I really liked him, especially having an 8 am he didn't make me want to fall asleep. There are a lot of online assignments so it helps your grade if you don't do well on tests and he is available for office hours.",1
"Lizs lectures are unorganized & unprepared. She does not use visual aids which hinders the learning of majority of her students. She is incredibly soft spoken & without personality. Her lectures are dry, long & seemingly unimportant. It is hard to evaluate what information is most important in her lectures & what will be found on tests and exam",0
He doesn't really explain well in class lectures. His examples were straight from the book without actual imput from him. He plays irrelavent math games in class on purpose to get the students interested. He relies on the students to catch his mistakes but if a student is learning material how would we know the mistakes.,0
"Her classes aren't that bad, but her manner of dealing with students is the real problem. She targets students she doesn't like and makes them feel completely worthless.",0
"I enjoyed having Professor fields because she was approachable, but she didnt get back to me on a few emails (or took 3 days). The class was kind of difficult, honestly. Reading the chapters was a breeze and the information wasnt hard to grasp, but the homework assignments and tests were pretty difficult. I barely got an A and had to work HARD.",1
"Don't as for any help, vague and won't go out of his way to help you.",0
LOVE THIS TEACHER!  He the BEST!,1
"Because he would rather sound 'correct' as opposed to understandable, he seems more concerned with the quality of his own voice than being a good teacher. His online class only uses video lectures, which are unnecessarily tedious and boring. Bottom line: This professor makes an interesting subject like music needlessly challenging and frustrating.",0
His tests are very very hard. His lectures are extremely long and difficult to follow. He does not use powerpoint or anything for his lectures. It is also very difficult to keep a good grade in his class. Would not take him again.,0
You don't attend Thurs and have DBs about movies instead those days. Proceeded to look around at what people said the movie was about then pretend I watched it too. Final project poorly explained. No lectures in class; all you do is discuss assigned readings in groups. Why is this not an online class? Ugh. I couldn't take her seriously.,0
If you are hard working and do your homework she is fair and you get the grade earned. She is always available to help and she has no control over the homework the department assigns it all. Just make time for it at least 4 hours per chapter. She has knowledge and works well with difficult learners. Overall i would not take any other stat professor,1
Overall he is a easy teacher. I was worried about taking stats but this was an easy A. He gives extra credit for participation. We only took three tests and one final exam. His tests are exactly as the study guide. You don't have to listen to his lectures because he basically goes over the book. He has an accent but you get used to it. Take him!,1
"Yes, very smart and too much for  Susquehanna University",1
"Judy truly cares about the personal well being of her students and their internal learning more than tests.  You may take it bc its easy, but she'll care so much about you that you end up caring alot about the class, and learning.  And she's brilliant.",1
"Professor Peng is a really caring person who accommodates students by giving extended due dates understanding that we have alot of stress at the moment with the pandemic and online schooling. Her course breakdown was a simple 2 case assignments, midterm and final. Powerpoint slides worked well with textbook so use the textbook for her class.",1
THIS IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE BEST TEACHERS AT ASU. Things to know hes a fair grader and his class is simple its all about veteran advocating. You get your assignment once a week a quiz and a writing assignment of 300 words. Participation in class matters remember everything in yellowdig for that. Its honest a great class.,1
"Shes an amazing professor. Therere 3 essays , a midterm and final , but they are fairly easy. She takes attendance daily and starts off by asking everyone to answer the roll call question. Her class is easy and manageable. I would really recommend her class and her as a teacher if you are a Child Development major.",1
"One of the worst professors at PCC. Teaching style is terrible and his notes dont correlate to the homework, quizzes, or tests. From using the equations he has taught us I have figured out that he is a poo poo teacher and that is the only equation I was able to figure out while taking his class. Dont take this class/professor if you want a future",0
"He is absolutely awesome! He's very understanding and down to earth. The class was very opininated and sometimes it got very tense, but he always knew how to calm things down and put us back on track. I loved his class!",1
"I got an A from this class from determination alone. He gives you extra credit on some tests (if you correct them) but other than that, nada. After the second day absent, you lose points. And he has this ridiculous grading system where he replaces the lowest test score (say an 80) with your final (say a 50), regardless of score. Hated it.",0
"Good guy. He's teaching this class for first time. He seems to know a lot but it doesn't always come across that way. Book is small,cheap but there are errors in it. Instructor admitted such.",1
Her lectures are long and she just talks at you for most of it. Tests are alright but she grades them very meticulously. The homework are an easy 100% but they don't count for much towards your grade. I would not take this class again.,0
My first semester with her was an awesome one. I wish I could have her for the remaining 3 semesters. She gives you all you need to succeed in the class. She will not sugar coat and there will be no misunderstandings from her. She says what she means and means what she says. If you have the opportunity you should select her for 1300/1451,1
"Class is way too dark, exams are very difficult, she puts things on the exam that are not in the book or her objectives. She also gives 80 page powerpoints that have nothing to do with the exams. She talks a lot and most of the time its about things that are not on the exam, and it takes her 3 days to get through one PowerPoint.",0
"Professor Warden was a great teacher. She made the class interesting. She was a fair grader and as long as you do the assignment how it says to, you get a good grade. No final or other tests. Would DEFINITELY recommend her course. ",1
"I find it hilarious how a professor can take the longest time to grade a paper yet can send multiple emails saying that any work turned in late will not be graded unless you are in a ""dying situation."" We are currently in a pandemic and she has missed a lot of classes yet can't forgive her students for doing work tardy. Also doesn't check her email",0
I was super nervous to take his class as I haven't taken a math class in five years. His assigned homework is ALWAYS related to tests and very helpful. He grades very fairly. He is an awesome teacher willing to explain and answer questions. Fast grading. Not to mention he's very nice and cracks a few jokes. He also brought treats several times :),1
VERY VERY VERY HARD...  BUT HE IS VERY COOL AND VERY FAIR...  WOULD DO AGAIN,1
all im gonna say is that the mean exam scores were in the low 40's for the ENTIRE CLASS. Highest was in the 50's.,0
"His class was challenging, but it really taught me so much. If you don't understand something, go to his office hours. He is always there to help and will definitely be one of my fav. profs. ",1
"Dr. Robert Schmidt is the man!  If you want to learn from a professor who knows it all, take a class with this guy.  If you can get past his awkwardness you will surely enjoy learning from this professor.",1
"I'm not crazy about his teaching style, nor do I think his powerpoint/lectures are well put together. With that said, he is a very intelligent man w/ a sense of humor. As a working paralegal he is able to tell you about how things really show down in the field. You are going to work in his class, but you come out appreciating it. I recommend.",1
"During class Daria only goes through 2 to 4 questions per chapter, which is definitely not sufficient enough for students to understand the content properly. Her online quizzes were not quizzes, they were very difficult and cannot be finished on time. She does not set any expectations which makes it hard in a content heavy course.",0
".Not a lot of feedback, she doesn't like to get emails by students. It is really hard to get good grade own this class. However, I have learned a lot of things fro her! She is organized and clear how to teach. DEFINITELY, HARD GRADER!! DONT TAKE HER CLASS IF YOU WANT TO PASS EASILY!",0
"the worst ever. she makes the course so so so hard. also, she challenges the students. She feels satisfies if the student can't answer her quizzes or exams.",0
Professor Miura is extremely vague when it comes to lectures. He only skims through basic information rather than developing detail for the material he is teaching. Be sure to do all the work possible outside of class because he will not be specific during class. This was a lab course and it wasn't as detailed as other courses Ive taken at Loyola.,0
Jana is a great professor! She makes the complicated concepts make sense and is always great at answering questions.  She is a very supportive professor and really cares about her students.,1
"She is a good teacher, but does like to make you work. The work is easy enough if you keep up with her.",1
Fantastic! My favorite teacher so far at UB. Nice guy. Very good at keeping students interested. Easy tests. Couldn't ask for better.,1
Do the readings and the quizzes and participate in discussion. The midterm and final are pretty straightforward.,1
"JP is a perfect example of someone who can't ""do"", so they teach instead. He is totally inept when it comes to software development and loves to tell you what the ""industry"" is doing, when it's not only completely inaccurate but it's laughable, he's never worked a day in his life in the private sector. Avoid, he's hard to understand and childish.",0
i completed a few of her courses back in 2010-11. chingling was my match in the English dept. she brought out the best in me in class and on paper. i found her essay prompts challenging as they gave me the opportunity to be creative and intellectual. chingling is intelligent. she helped me see little details that actually were bigger.,1
"If Professor Mason doesn't like your writing style you won't get an A no matter how hard you try. He expects a lot and is rarely available outside of office hours. His tangents do end up on the tests though, so take extensive notes. I've had him twice and I will do anything not to take him again.",0
"You should take Kageyama if you want to learn anatomy. He's a great guy. You'll find the class rewarding if you work hard, and fascinating even if you do not.",1
"she is a great teacher, loves all her students, class was never boring and students are able to understand well. If you come to class your guaranteed to pass its such n easy simple class as long as your present and participate in activities!",1
No longer teaching. Professror Emeritus. Laid a good foundation for future teachers to model. His clarity of thought and instruction has helped me in my upper level courses. Master teacher,1
"basic course not as hard as described by others. Just do your work, the test and quizzes match closely.",1
"All the reviews about her are right! She is awesome & during the pandemic she lighten the workload and was very flexible with due dates as long as they were in before the end of the semester! I also loved her class and writing poetry, plays and a short story.",1
"First of all, its not the easiest class in the world, and it certainly didnt help that Rayburn didnt seem to care to actually TEACH the material...pretty much he just told you to do it and whether you not you already knew how to do it or not didnt matter. Hopefully if you take this class, you are able to look at the book and just teach yourself...",0
"If you are in the psychology field, it is a must to learn about your professors as you expect them to learn about you. You must read and learn the flow of this class and if you are involved and listen to her lectures, she pretty much tells you what will be on every graded quiz or test. Reach out and you will be met at the other end. Effort is key",1
"I took this class to boost my gpa. Way too much work for a class that should be simple. Yes, you watch movies, but you also have to do a lot of reading. The avg on all assignments is in the 70s. Very rude and condescending in emails, harsh grader, TAs grade nicer but you have 0 contact w them. Never once felt sure if I was doing anything correctly.",0
"Obviously, this class is not even remotely easy (you should know this coming). Material is difficult to analyze and comprehend, and exams are PURELY essay-based regarding book content (he wrote the book). I would say lecture is mandatory, considering. GO TO CLASS, TAKE NOTES, AND READ THE BOOK. You can pass, just try. It's GE, right?",1
This class has a million TAs but it takes forever for assignments to be graded. The tests are very difficult and the reviews aren't recorded. High expectations for a GE class. Lectures are very very long and boring. Not a lot of talk about current events. Could have been much better and had a lot of potential but just fell flat b/c of COVID maybe??,0
"While the class may have been hard, he did a great job teaching it. He tried to get the class involved in discussions all the time.",1
This Professor has very broad and in-depth knowledge in several areas of science. His vast research experience makes him explain any difficult topic with nice examples. He possesses hands on technical experience.,1
"Dr.Hill is a terrible professor. This class was extremely difficult, and rather useless considering it 100% filled with pre-health professional students who do not care to study ecology. Exams were very unfair and graded even more unfairly. Professor is stubborn and does not even reply to emails. Try to take the class online!!!",0
DO NOT TAKE GENETICS AT UIC. It is way harder than it needs to be and they make sure you don't succeed.,0
I had Professor Dattolo for Spanish I and 2 and I am am glad I did. Not only did i learn so much from him but he restored my belief that there are still professors at WPU who really care. He is clear in his explanations and if you ever need extra help or advice he is always there for you. I wish more professors were like Professor Dattolo!,1
"Class is very unorganized to the point where self-researching the quiz/test topics is where I actually learned anything. Tons of topics that are tested on and required to know yet only briefly mentioned in class, so studying for tests became looking up all the given 'key terms' on wikipedia. Lectures skip around and make no cohesive sense.",0
"Here's the thing about Tareneh. She ultimately wants you to learn. But it is up to you know A LOT about java to pass this class. She has office hours but never really responds to emails. She will not leave, so you better suck up to her ESPECIALLY if you're on the CS general track. She is a nice person if you put in effort and show up to class.",0
each time I ask him about the class work. His attitude was so mean. I will not take any of his class again.,0
"She's a great and easy professor. Doesn't like lecturing for the duration of the entire class, and when she does, the lectures are fun to listen to. She adds stories about her experiences in the field, and overall, makes the class fun. Tests aren't hard, but do make sure to skim through the book. Bring a laptop as you will find it very helpful!!",1
"As much as I hated this class and the material, I know I could've done better with a better professor. You get 4 grades; midterm lab/lecture exam and final lab/lecture exam. That's it. They are HARD. Took notes and nothing was on the lecture exams. Lab exams he does do a review, GO!! And do not miss labs they help your grade a TON! Good luck!",0
"His tests were really hard. The tests were nothing like the labs or homework. His lectures weren't so great, he started off expecting you to understand Matlab and how to code. Major of the class failed or got a D. Not an easy class at all.",0
"I sm majoring in business so I had to take Macroeconomics. Be warned you have to teach yourself in this class. Most of what you learn will be on the test, but some questions you have to read 3-4 times cause they are ""trick"" questions. You are required to do a paper at the end about how to boost Maine's economy, and she gives no help whatsoever!!!!",0
Great!,1
"Never take this professor. He lets you have a page for exams to write down anything you want, but it doesnt help because tests are designed to confuse you, my class avg for the 1st test was a 28% and the extra credit offered due to this was hrs worth of hw for a max of 2%. No point going to class because you usually will spend the time watching TV.",0
"It's a very detailed subject with a lot of information covered in a relatively short time. Show up (most important!), read the text, do your homework and it's easy-peasy. Make sure to take notes because he gives a lot of extra explanation in class to help understand the text/labs.",1
"Vraimenr ennuyant comme cours. Le livre suffit pour la matière. Les examens ne traitent même pas de la matière vu en classe, c'est seulement de la logique. Ce n'est aucunement du par coeur, mais du bon sens. Elle est très généreuse dans la correction des travaux et le cours est facile a passé. Personne coule.",0
"Honestly this class was unreasonably difficult for a 101 class. It's not that it was hard necessarily, just way too much work expected for such a low level course. Lectures were not good and she just read off the slides for the most part that had nothing to do with the tests. Too much outside work and event attendances required.",0
"His lectures are interesting. He's a nice guy, but don't be fooled he is a tough grading professor. He gives out vocabulary quizzes, which can be helpful. You have to do the readings, in order to understand whats going on in class, lectures are long but he does give a 15 minute break. Personally, I would not take this professor ever again. Beware!",1
"If you want to learn personlity through the book, take the class. She teaches from the book and has a lot of work. Discussion posts and response are pretty specific but manageable. Not an easy class. Quizzes are specific but just read the chapter and you will be fine.",1
Great teacher and really takes interest in her students. Workload is managable and she is a fair grader. There were a few writing assignments and quizzes and a discussion question each week. There was also a Proctored exam. You won't regret taking this class.,1
Had interesting lectures that you wanted to attend.  Very involved with the students  .  Tests were all open book.  Overall a very good professor.,1
"65% of class dropped before exam 4. Chem 1 & 2 material is presented throughout. Organic chem is at end of course. It CHM 2045 text, homework, and labs. Ask for help and he'll tell you to go use the internet to learn. Take CHM 1030 if you can. Don't take this class unless you aced AP Chem. This is not an intro chem class.",0
He is the best professor. He give one midterm exam and one final and both of them are home take. in the midterm you can do as many times you can and raise your grade. He usually look at the effort that students put in his midterm. He is simply awesome and care for his students.,1
"Thornton is awesome. He codes alongside his lectures and explains his process in a way that makes sense. His notes are kinda dense, but they're helpful and align with his lectures in a way that helps reinforce stuff that may not have made sense upon first reading them. He gives a reasonable amount of work too. I really can't complain about him.",1
"Reddy was great. The class moves fast, it covers a whole chapter each lecture. Every class except three throughout the whole term is a lecture, and theres very minimal homework. The material itself is definitely manageable, as long as you stay on top of your learning. The labs taught by grad assistants were genuinely fun, which is a plus!",1
"Lecture's optional but I would recommend going because they are entertaining and he includes real world applications to what you're learning. He cares that you learn the material and succeed as opposed to trying to fail you, which is a nice change of pace in the ME college.",1
"She is the best yoga instructor I have ever had!!  This is an excellent class to take, and you can get a letter grade!!",1
Such a sweetheart!! Super approachable and good in lecture. I studied for maybe 1 hour for each exam.,1
DO NOT BUY THE BOOKS. You literally don't need them. I just showed up and did other work on my computer. You have a reflection due every week but its super easy and he's a really really easy grader. Your midterm is take home and no final. Other than the midterm and reflections you have an easy group project and a bigger reflection paper. TAKE HIM!!,1
"Good person, nice, accessible, a man of intelligence and ehthusiasm. However, Intro to economy is really not suitable for him to teach. so many reading without any specific instruction. Always looking for your visit during office hour, which is good, but often I don't have questions because I do not really understand what we are learning.",0
"I had Dr. Strange for Conservation, a class he created.  Incredible!!  This was one of the best classes I have taken at UT.  Dr. Strange is funny, passionate, engaging and a downright blast.  I learned so much in this class.  Don't miss this one!!",1
"It was an online class which meant that communication with the teacher is very important, but she was pretty much impossible to get in contact off. Too many tests and the tests are hard.",1
"Don't waste your time; if you want to get anything out of her classes - good luck. She's flighty and there's no structure to her classes - she likes to make things up as she goes. Poor communication with students, takes days to get back to you if you have questions- you're lucky if you know if you're having class from week to week. NO!!!!!!!!!!!",0
"Attendance isn't mandatory, but it does affect your grade. Come to class, take notes, and everything else will be easy.",1
"You learn a lot from class than any other high school or human sexuality courses. It's true he talks about his life A LOT so likely you won't get through the whole chapter. His exams are hard so study repeatedly. I had open book but I still ended up with a C so be prepared, attendance is key, read during lectures, and stay awake he watches everyone",0
"The professor had many students that found the material challenging and does not try to explain the material thoroughly. I attended his office hours and even that was useless. He told me because Im not doing so well, that I should try again next semester with a smile on his face. I would not recommend taking his class unless you already know the m",0
"Easiest class I have ever taken! There are only a few assignments, and 2 listening exams, but they are super easy if you study a little bit. You also have to attend 2 concerts as assignments, but they are ultimately an easy A+ and grade-booster. Take this class!!!",1
"Great Instructor! Awesome feedback. Not too much homework or quizzes. If you have questions, he is there for you. Prompt in answering emails. ",1
"He doesn't follow his syllabus and has trouble connecting with his students on an educational level. He will talk endlessly about a subject without allowing students enough hands-on experience, which inevitably bites you in the ass when the end of the semester rolls in and he realizes you've done .5/10 of his intended projects. Nice & funny though.",0
"Has a funny sense of humor, and keeps class interesting. Not too hard of a grader. Gives you all the information on everything you need to write about, alot easier than other teachers who teach English 1002 g.",1
"easy professor, get him if you can",1
"Dr. Khadka is a great professor, he is very smart, and it can be seen from his teaching style. his lecture were great and his structure of teaching was excellent and helped me thrive in this class.  Everything was organized and was easy to follow for the most part!",1
"Do not take this teacher. Extremely unorganized and never responds to emails, also barely puts work up on time for online class until half the class emails her so she has to extend the deadlines and make assignments due in 2 days rather than the week. Many long, pointless assignments 10+ pages that she won't grade until 2 months later. Just don't..",0
Awful teacher. I came in with no coding experience and was immediately lost. Inaccessible and frankly rude outside of class when asking questions. Quizzes and exams are worded confusingly and he often makes mistakes.,0
I was very interested in this course but I did not like her style or the lack of clarity from the teacher. I would not take a course with her again,0
"Not only has this professor managed to make a single intro class as hard as possible, during a pandemic, but she has managed to bore any interest in Geology which existed out of me. Her every response is either cryptic or sarcastic. Not to mention her cryptic and possibly non-existent grading system, labs and exams alike. Wish I checked RMP sooner",0
"If you work hard for this class then you will be rewarded by a good grade. He's very lenient with the grading of the students. However, if he sees you trying hard then you will pass with either an B, C or A.",1
TOOOOOOOOO SLOWWWWWWW!,0
"If you don't like writing and want an easy A, pick another class. However, if you want to improve your writing tenfold (and eliminate the use of cliché in your papers), then take this class. There are some quizzes on the assigned reading material, and lectures are coupled with in-class debates.",1
"he's hard-core knowledgeable but forgiving grade-wise; and no class attendance policy, which is nice",1
Her teaching style is lacking in clarity. You are pretty much on you own for knowing how to write a paper. Her tips and tricks are not very useful.,0
"Dr Osoba is a difficult professor, but I learned a great deal in his class. Well worth the time and money. Very different approach. Very Interactive. Very heavy work load, a lot of time is required for reading, problem sets, papers, exams (cumulative final). He is genuinely dedicated to Economics and teaching.",1
Randy is a great guy and wants to further our futures art. Super cool and nice guy! Wants you to succeed and helps you with your project ideas if need be.,1
"There are four tests, of which he will drop one. The class of 70 students averaged 61% on the final three tests. The professor is loud, and sometimes inappropriate. While it is apparent he knows the material well, he does a poor job conveying that knowledge to his students. An obstacle to overcome, not an introduction to the subject. Avoid!",0
Awesome professor. Make class fun and easy to learn. Be on time to class as she like to give quizzes for extra credit; which you will need. Go over her slides and the book.,1
"Nina is fabulous! I had her for philosophy of literature, and it was excellent. Not only is the content super interesting (lots of different readings, but they aren't dull), but she gives you room for creativity in the assignments, which isn't very common (at least not that I've found). Take her class!!!!!!",1
Staring at the wall is more eventful than his lectures. He is not very good at presenting information. All his exams are fill in the blank with word banks and attendance sheet is there to be signed every day.,0
This professor has experience and knowledge in/of the business world.  She stays up-to-date on many topics and keeps the class interested and throughout her lectures.  She also has many theories on teaching and how students learn and apply them to class.  She also takes real-world scenarios and applies them to her classes.,1
Thomson is generally a nice teacher and a easy grader. EASY B if your looking to slack off. does require you to buy novels and stories but they are cheaper than textbooks so thats a plus. good teacher i would recommend him to others.,1
"If you like hard tests that aren't like the lectures, and thick accents, Singh is the man for you",0
"I'm a business major so I wasn't exciting about taking this class to fulfill my degree, but professor Riggs is funny, caring, and pretty cool. Offers 2 attempts on all questions, and even extra credit to help you on your lowest scoring quiz. If you need to take an elective to graduate, he should be one of your top choices!",1
10/10 take her! she was amazing and by far my favorite teacher ever. Show up to class and put in effort and you shouldn't have a problem getting an A.,1
This class was an easy A! The professor was so nice and understanding. There was little to no homework and it was always easy to understand. Please take this class!,1
She is a very nice lady. Her lecture can be a bit boring sometimes (make sure to participate once in a while) but she definitely cares about her students and the class isn't too hard.,1
"This lady is the reason I am the Spelman woman that I am. Yes, she is tough and expects much of the women who come through her class, but she loves what she does. She has a passion for teaching and for Spelman and it shows in her teaching! She is also willing to work with you if you need it!",1
Don't take English with her if English is not your strong subject.,0
"He pauses in between sentences which adds up to half the class time Spends a month lecturing half a chapter. During reviews, he goes over questions that won't be on the exam . Takes off points if you don't solve it the way he wants it. I should have listened to the previous reviews on this man. Please read the other reviews and avoid this man.",0
"Unbelievably rude and unapproachable professor. Claims he wants to quit his job because his averages are so low.. but doesn't try to change his methods. 10 people dropped his class in the first three weeks. Makes unnecessary rude comments about not caring if you fail. Also, he only knows how to answers questions and does NOT have a proper lecture.",0
This class was entirely NOT what I expected. It is WAY too technical for the average person. The teacher is incredibly awkward and her shrill voice gave me a headache every single class. She was very ambiguous about homework and exams. I would NOT recommend this class to a friend.,0
She is one of the best professors! She is very helpful and adorable. Do your outlines and speeches on time and you will get an easy  A. ,1
This class would have been fine if trying to turn in work wasn't so hard. She allowed everyone to redo this one assignment and I went to turn in the redo I couldn't because she somehow graded my redo when I haven't even turned it in yet. Come to find out she graded the original one I turned in already before she even let us do a redo it. Ignored,0
Saralina comes into class smiling everyday and is always so excited to dive into literature.  What a great teacher to have first thing in the morning.,1
Hes a very funny man who deserves more than a part time position. I do recommend him for CTA103 and intro to acting as well. He does give some quizzes in class and two test for the semester. Nothing is cumulative for the end of semester exam. Very chill atmosphere. Can be annoying at times because theirs a lot of theater nerds who take his class.,1
"You really have to learn it yourself. Plus, he will wait until the end of the semester to grade anything, so you have no idea where you stand in the class. However, he does curve. A lot. Big curves. Like where did that come from? Still a stressful class though.",0
"Monica Hall is an amazing professor!  She is very clear when explaining different topics.  BIO 121 is a very difficult class, but she makes the material make sense.",1
"It's an interesting intro course if you're exploring European Studies. A variety of professors come in and lecture from various fields. A lot of reading, and most of it is pretty boring. Some of the topics are pretty cool, but some are boring. He's pretty sarcastic and likes to show that he's right about everything, which gets annoying. It's aight.",1
"One of the worst professors I have ever  had. He didn't explain the work in a manner that all students could understand, & would not help students that were not clear. His class was  with out a doubt the longest hour& 40 minuets ever. Stay away...",0
"Terrible teacher. Very unclear. Even though she is kinda helpful, doesn't know what she is talking about. In all honesty i could teach this class myself better than her",0
"I don't know what others here are talking about. She's a very nice teacher. She responds quickly to emails. The exams are timed which is very nerve-wracking but it's how it's done in person so I don't mind. At the end of every exam, she gives 10 extra credits which is ALOT. Chem is a hard subject overall so get ready to study hard.",1
"By a wide margin, the least enthused professor I've ever had. It is difficult to pay attention in this class even though I love biology. No involvement from the class or anything to keep you on your toes. Just do your homework, read the chapters, show up, you'll get an A.",0
"If you have no prior physics background, this class will be impossible. I consider myself to be pretty smart and I was lost from day 1. Doesn't teach just tells you to do the example problems on your own. The tests are easy to fail because the multiple choice are 5 pts each and he barely gives partial credit on the open ended. Very tough class. ",0
"professor gaffin is very unspecific in what he wants us to study, he can generalize at times he tends sometimes make people feel uncomfortable, my advice is to come to class and read the readings and study then you will not have to worry about failing.",0
Nice guy but too disorganized to run an online class. Spent hours trying to figure out which site each assignment was on (never used blackboard like most online profs). Paid $100 for book + $100 online course fee and got an A but couldn't even tell you what Human Geography is. Easy enough to fulfill requirements but you won't learn anything.,0
"TAKE another professor even if you have to wait for next semester. I devoted at least 6-8 hrs daily on chem. You teach yourself. Tests are not similar to worksheets/quizzes as she says. Tests are specifically structured to confuse & throw you off track, no matter how much you study, even switches the periodic table day of exam.",0
"Amazing lectures, easy to understand, very helpful if u don't understand",1
There's a lot of group discussion for an online class. First time in an online class I felt like I got to know the other students. That's good if you had a great group like my class was. I can see where it could be bad with a worse group though. Textbook is not necessary.,1
Mr. Pierce is an amazing professor! Gives lots of quizzes but they are directly from the PowerPoints. He makes reviews for every test on the concepts that will be tested. I had 0 idea about animals and I got an A. TAKE THIS CLASS AND PROFESSOR do the work and get an A,1
Very weird considering that this lecture class included like 4 different professors teaching a humanities course. There are so many quizzes and they're so obscure to the lecture notes. Would stay away from this class if you need a good grade.,0
"This professor is very strict. He doesn't allow leaving the lecture hall during his lecture, unless you are leaving the class. He seems to get extremely frustrated when his lecture is interrupted by a question from one of his students and gives very short, harsh answers. There is no discussion or participation in class.",0
"continuation from below. I have graduated form nursing school and this to date is the most difficult class and work load of my career. I am going Tuesday to drop it. Mind you, i have no job right now, a partner and two dogs...i have the time but its just ridiculous. She has been late both classes, no real teaching plate-form, demands your life",0
"He is an amazing teacher, he really cares if you pass. The only thing I don't like is he preaches his democratic philosophy and its clear. Other than that its a 5 Star.",1
Amazing teacher. One of the best teachers I've ever had. He is very approachable for questions. Very charismatic and keeps your attention. He is very  entertaining and is full of knowledge. You can really tell he cares for his work and students.,1
"Ms. Gordon will work with you and she explain the work.  IF you do not show up for class she will drop you,(makes room for the ones that want to learn). Very easy going and I have her for all my math.",1
"Terrible professor; would avoid at all costs. Powerpoints are very scattered and lack flow. She slides in unnecessary, snarky comments at times. ",0
"nice lady, but if you care about your GPA id avoid taking this class with her at all costs! shes very unorganized & there is almost 2 weeks of class left & shes only posted one grade plus attendance. she is also picky at grading so its unfair for us to know what to work on to get a better grade when she doesnt give us anything to compare to.",0
Overall he was so rude and unprofessional.. he was literally horrible and known through the school and student body as so. I wish I was able to take the class with someone else.,0
This class is horrible with him. I attended this class everyday. Some TAs grade very hardly. Not helpful. Not clear. Not easy.,0
"Super sweet lady! Attendance is required, but you can do your other homework or study during class. Don't have to pay attention. EASY A!!! Gives tons of bonus! She gives you all of the test questions and answers during the review! Highly recommended!!",1
"He is an amazing teacher! I took this class as a hybrid and it worked really well with my schedule. His work isn't hard if you take the time to do them. If you listen and follow his instruction you should easily get an A. I will take more classes from him. I would highly recommend, we didn't take any test, we just did the 2 major papers quizzes, hw",1
"For Stem Seminar 2 , he's been a great teacher, giving good feedback and makes us laugh sometimes. We all feel engaged in his class.  Though he may not look it, he is a humble yet precise professor. He will always help you if you need help with anything.",1
Great lectures however the tests are graded completely unfairly by his group of 4 other graders so there is no consistency.  if you can afford the high probability of a C  the material is worth it.,1
Out of all my 18 years in school I have to say that she has been the BEST teacher EVER!! She is so understanding and her lesson plans are easy to follow and this is a class you'll miss 100%!!,1
"Profesor Bamford loves Philosophy, and wants her students to learn something. Two papers (opinion-based), a midterm and final. For both tests, you can bring a 'cheat sheet'. Incredibly kind and understanding. Assigns lots of readings for class, but does not check if you've read them or not. Class usually consists of powerpoints and group work.",1
YEA WHAT THEY SAID !,0
"Two Exams + final totaling 80% of grade. Very tough class, but Dave is a great person. I probably would've done a lot better had I gone to get help from him outside of class and read the textbook. Nonetheless, make sure to study important concepts, and work problems over and over. Dave often forgets to upload homework so remind him, practice helps!",1
"Osburn was a very good professor who explained the content well and made sure students understood and was a very nice professor until the last 2 weeks of class. With COVID we had to switch all online, and he gave a final that was VERY unfair and (class average 35%), tanked nearly everyones grade multiple letter grades because of this.",0
"5 tests, the last being a cumulative final. 2 projects (both short papers). The tests are really easy and you don't really need the book. He provided us with online study flashcards, which were very helpful. Usually takes 1 hour to lecture, very rarely takes up the 75 mins. He is very knowledgable about ABA and I highly suggest him.",1
"Bob is so much fun and definitely one of the best professors I've had in all of college. A great guy with a lot of charisma, you'll love this professor no doubt in my mind.",1
"Great teacher. However, your GPA will not thank you. He is overly ambitious with the amount of information he tries to teach. His expectations for essays are ridiculous; papers that would easily get an A in other English classes will bring you Bs in an O'Quinn class. You need to think like him to get a good mark. Good teacher, evil marker.",1
"He is the easiest professor i have dealt with. He will tell you in 1st day of that you are  guaranteed an A or B at the worst if you come to class. All the exams are 12 take home and the reviews are same as the exams, he only changes the numbers. Easy A for everyone, even if you are horrible in math like i was. He is the man. Best professor ever.",1
"The tests go into way more depth than she or her slides explain. How are you supposed to know things that she isn't willing to teach you? My whole class of 50 bombed a test, and she said she went through the questions and all of them were in the notes, if they weren't that they were implied. How can you teach people based on implications?! Horrible",0
"This class was absolutely the most tedious class I have ever taken.  Everything had to be perfect, and he was not very helpful. He answers questions with a question. (student)""Dr. Walsh, is this the right chemical formula to use?""...(Dr. Walsh)""I don't know, is it?""  If would highly advise a different professor if you possibly could.",0
"Quizzes/test straight from the powerpoints. Didn't need them, though. However... case studies suck, are different from text problems, and don't expect her nor the TA to help, either. She never helped in discussions or private email. I guess she expects the online students to automatically understand the studies, which are 18 points of final grade.",0
"Professor Leung is a wonderful teacher! He worked very hard to present the material in a clear and understandable way.  He responded to all questions quickly, even over the weekend.  I recommend this class to everyone!",1
"He is an amazing person overall. Great professor to have for any class! He is very good at giving feedback and spending office hours with you to aid you in grasping the understanding of the text. My favorite seminar teacher. He is also a good Theology professor, but I have not taken a class with him for that. THE BEST OF THE BEST.",1
"She's a pretty tough grader, but she tells you exactly what she wants, and expects that you follow those guidelines.  The amount of writing assigned is reasonable for an english class.  The time in the classroom was my favorite part. Lots of good discussions and insights into writing and literature.  Probably the best english class I've ever taken.",1
"Very scatterbrained, not organized at all, I do not recommend taking her at all.",0
She is not clear about what she teaches. She thinks very one sidely. I would recommend not taking her class. You will not learn anything.,0
"As a person he is whatever but I respect his way of teaching. Compared to the rest of the math department, he is imo the best math teacher. I love the way he grades, 3 tests each 33%. Doesn't give homework but gives example problems with clear given solutions that reflect exactly into the tests. He knows what to teach and how to teach it.",1
Best professor ever! Unorthodox in ways of teaching that keeps you engaged,1
First let me start by saying this professor wants you to think in his frame of mind. Many classmates would not participate because he would shut their answers down. Repeated himself quite often. He also will fail you if you miss 2 classes. He was aware of situation and went back on his word and failed me anyway with no explanation stopped replying.,0
"Abeh was pretty easy, if he knew your name you you were golden!  Take good notes for test prep.  If you take him for Aviat. Leg. he will tell you all sorts of irrelevant crazy info, like how to get out of a speeding ticket!",0
"Dr. Hayes is the most intimidating woman I have ever met. I had borderline panic attacks every time I walked into my piano class. If you mess something up, she will call you out in front of the class & make you do it over & over until you get it right. I would try to ask questions but she would just look at me like I was stupid. Worst class ever.",0
Excellent course and caring teacher. This is an advanced course in Linux system administration learning information security methodologies which enables me to earn industry standards certification. Very interesting and very useful course.,1
She is very smart in her own way but cannot express what she is trying to teach. She is probably one of the smartest people I have ever met but cannot teach what she knows. I relied on the book and other people in the class to get an A. She does post a lot of quizzes online that can really help your grade if you look for the right answer.,0
Make sure to do the readings because he will notice. Grades are mostly based around participation but he will make sure you participate in discussions.,1
"Doctor Ahmad is a professor who genuinely cares about her students and is a good lecturer, however you really have to keep up with everything she's saying to understand. Her tests are brutal and to do well you need to study a little every day, however, her study guides aren't exactly accurate. Hardest class I've ever taken but APII is usually hard.",0
"Her tone is always condescending. Especially since shes smiling 24/7, even when irritated. Her instructions can be extremely vague but then she's very specific about what she wants from you. If you miss class then that's at least 3 grades going in as a 0 cause she'll put the report that's due the next week in as a 0 as well",0
"Proffesor Valltos is a very fair grader. Goes directly from the rubric and is very accomodating, just as long as you communicate. The weekly post are extensive (usually 6 questions to be answered in one post) but a requierement. Also, the final is BRUTAL! It definitey takes allll week to complete with lots of research.",1
She is a great teacher and proides study guides. All you have to is show up because you get a lot of in class assignments and just need 2 do your projects/papers.,1
He does not really care about hi students and he is not very specific. He goes through things too fast. He takes too many points off of lab and it was a struggle to get good grades on labs. I would have to go to another professor to get good grades on the labs.,0
Professor Aragona is an amazing professor who is very understanding. I enjoyed taking her class and I hope she is teaching my other edu classes next semester.,1
"Great Professor, Wants to see you succeed and improve. The class was easy and helpful. It is an easy A as long as you try to learn how to play piano a bit.",1
"you learn a lot more than just public speaking. life conversations come up and he is knowledgable, its awesome to pick his brain. if you don't have your speech ready he will give you an extension, but do not abuse it!",1
"NEVER take ecology with her unless you can get the tests from previous years. She'll talk about something in class for maybe 5 seconds and put an entire page of questions on the test. She literally can't teach and makes the class based off of group quizzes. Really difficult time passing this class and I'm usually an A student, good luck w yang.",0
"Dr. Dudley is very fascinated with Psychology, specifically Research Methods, which makes going to his class entertaining and informative. He has a quirky and witty sense of humor which keeps the class light and fun. The class has a couple group experiments that you conduct, some online quizzes for each chapter of the book, a midterm, and a final.",1
This class is easy if you do all of the work assigned (which is NOT a lot). She puts grades in very quickly and posts all of the powerpoints before an exam. ,1
TAs did all of the work on grading. Class was pretty basic and only discussed problem issues in forensic science. Timed exam (60 mins) on over a thousand plus pages of material and articles. Not a PhD instructor which really takes away from the quality of education at ASU. Did not comment on any assignments but did offer help when needed/asked.,0
Martin is a fantastic Prof and Im glad that I had the chance to take a class from him. His marking is very fair and his feedback is excellent!! He is funny and extremely intelligent and never belittles anyones thoughts or ideas. Id definitely recommend him as a prof.,1
He spent the first six weeks culling the class with nearly impossible exams and grading the weekly homework with an iron fist. Things got easier the second half but by no means easy. He offers extra credit which meant me spending $70 to see a live performance so I could do even more work in this work heavy class. Extremely serious and passionate.,0
She's helpful and makes the class fun! Definitely promotes friendships within the class and wants you to pass. She makes sure to answer every question that you might have! She also posts the book (an older version) link for everyone so I never even looked at the book. ,1
"Not the greatest, very VERY slow, and not organized by any means. Marking was often tough and he doesn't like to accept the arguments or ideas of other people. Though he is friendly and approachable, his teaching methods and style we not necessarily the best. I don't think I would recommend him",0
"Those who complain about this professor are right out of high school or are way too entitled. Its calc online youve gotta work to pass. She gives credit for work on exams which helps boost your grade, offers extra credit for going to tutoring which benefits you, GIVES YOU ACCESS TO HER TEXTBOOK FOR FREE and provides video reviews before exams.",1
Heyborne rocks!!! One of my favorite teachers. He is always there to help with anything. Take anything you can from him! you won't regret it,1
"Char could be pretty vague on what she wanted, not good with technology either. Make sure you completely follow the graph rules posted on her syllabus. You can turn a lab in early and make corrections before its due which is nice. Some prelab quizzes were annoying but manageable. I think ppl reported her bc she was suddenly nice at the end.",0
Many of Dr. Hines' lectures build upon one another. Skipping class is not a good idea as you will fall behind on these lectures. Attendance is graded by REEF polling questions. Go to class and keep speed with the lectures and it's an easy A.,1
She puts handouts on learn@uw before each lecture that are very helpful. Her tests are also not too bad if you study a little!,1
I'd definitely take this prof. I would recommend every possible advanced course but take the in between (inter) ones as well. All the classes rock. Very enjoyable. Yeah. Enjoyable.,1
Marek is a terrible teacher. He is very hard to understand. His lessons do not make sense as well. I think he just wakes up and teaches on the fly. Ridiculous how Humber College still has him hired.,0
I have a very tough time with math. That being said I've had some amazing math professors she is not one of them. She goes way too fast and doesn't explain anything. All her notes are just practice problems with no explanation. I along with many others dropped the class in fear of failing.,0
"Half of his lecture notes are nonsensical abbreviations that only make sense to him. Class is very conservative/ Christian based. Very much emphasizes what he agrees with in the class (lectures pro life for a hour and 45 mins, then 15 mins of pro choice coverage). Claims theism is the only logical choice, bases it on the watchmaker theory.",0
"Her lectures are very dry and she gets off track easily. It takes her forever to start the lecture since she always has some random thing to say at the beginning of class. Her tests are by far the laziest I've seen which leads to the wording to be either convoluted, ambiguous, or unclear. Even the typography and appearance of her tests look bad.",0
Great teacher. Take lecture notes and review them before tests and you will pass the class with no problem whatsoever.,1
Professor Hensley you can tell is very passionate about what he does and he is very knowledgable when it comes to business. This class was very easy online and required almost no studying for quizzes and exams. A couple group projects that you have to work on outside of class but overall an easy A.,1
"I love every second of our lessons, Morales Sensei makes the class super interesting and he is ALWAYS willing to help you in ANYTHING you could ever need. He makes it all very easy, interesting and FUNNY... WIsh every other professor was like him... Really easy tests and FUN PROJECTS! ",1
didn't care about student understand or not. many tests and didn't have time to ask he question.,0
"The class consists of you hearing her lecture 99% of the time. No in class assignments. She uses powerpoints to teach but they have no words which makes it hard to get notes. Shes very loud and talks like a 16 year old. Theres 10 quizzes with readings, 2 tests plus final and 2 essays. Wouldnt take her again, her way of teaching isnt for me.",0
"she is an amazing woman outside your classroom but ooh do not get confused when you see your grade at the end of the semester. Speaking of the devil, she actually gives undoable projects which are actually a pain in the ass.",0
"I love Dr. Oakley as a person, but this class is very hard for non geology majors. There are SO many opportunities to bring your grade up from the tests throughout the semester, but if you don't get As on those it can stop you from doing well in the class.",1
Do not take this prof. She seems all nice and sweet while she is talking but as soon as you go to approach her she treats you as if you are a child and dumb. save yourself,0
He is a great professor! I would take him for every class if I could. He is very clear on what he expects from you. He is a super nice guy and has lots of experience with business and management. It is an easy course but you also learn a lot from him. Highly suggest taking him for any class. His study guides are the test and there's one project.,1
Weekly homework & 3 exams. Takes long to reply to emails. Honestly was praying for a C and ended up getting a B because everyone else did bad too and I think he was a little more lenient after the COVID situation. I would recommend taking someone else if you can. He did end up letting me redo two homeworks at the end of the semester when I asked.,0
He was an excellent professor and really cares about his students. His office hours are great and he understands situations and helps out when it comes to emailing him. His class has several quizzes and homework and his tests are straight forward.,1
"I recommend that you sign up with him with any class that you can, he really cares about how well his student are doing and makes his lectures really interesting to listen to. He gives quizzes, Hw, and exams just like any other class but he switches it up for the hw and quizzes so it rotates between every other week,he gives plenty of time 4 both.",1
"She is one of the most wonderful professors or human being I have ever met. She is hilarious+ a great lecturer and teaches you not only what's in the textbook but also teaches you what's outside the textbook, a real-life lesson. She really cares about students. If you reach out to her for help she would make herself available for you.",1
"Honestly have never had a prof who didn't know how to answer students questions. unless you plan to do all the extra hw and tutoring, you wont pass. Horrible communication skills. Was not respectful.",0
"Really cool guy, obviously very knowledgeable in many fields, especially those he teaches. Electric personality, holds classroom attention with ease. His lectures are always provocative, sometimes intentionally uncomfortable as he delves into sensitive topics. However, the class was too easy and he had a tendency to ramble is lecture.",1
Terrible teacher. Does not answer emails and is very unclear. Her online videos do not make sense and uses YouTube to teach the class instead of her making an effort. Want to know your grade? You wont. She doesnt grade anything till last minute.,0
Phil is a great professor who cares about his students and his class is super fun. He is super chill and buys the whole class ice cream. He cares about his students and wants to make sure we succeed at USC. I 10/10 recommend and I would definitely take one of his classes again!,1
"She is not helpful at all!  When you email about group assignments she basically says ""Good luck, hope you can work it out.""  Grades outside of the rubric.  Avoid her if you possibly can. ",0
"Nixon was awkwardly happy all the time and was overall okay. Her office hours are the best way to get feedback. This class was writing one paper over the course of a semester, so the work load was usually either  a lot or none at all for a given week. You don't use the textbooks a ton but you should have them, check to see if there are pdfs online.",1
Would not recommend taking him. Very difficult grader and does not help very much unless you completely understand the book. I attended every class and participated in almost every lecture and attended office hours and he would not round my 79 to an 80. He will call you out in class and ask you to speak randomly. Don't take this class.,0
English is not his first language which wouldn't be a problem if he spoke loud and clear which he doesn't. You literally have to sit in front to hear him and you'd be lucky to understand. Very Disorganized. He forgets to teach the tricks in his trick questions. Would never take him again. Avoid like the plague.,0
"You will love this professor, except for the fact that he does not tell you what your grade is until the end of the course. Get ready to laugh because he is crazy weird. You will be working in quite a few group projects. The final requires you to present a blog filled with all your work and you will print and mat 15-20 of your best shots.",1
First half of the class she focuses on health economics and the second half is mainly health policy. Midterm killed everyone. Final is cumulative. Take good notes and literally write down everything she says.EVERYTHING. Lecture notes are ok but lack organization. don't need the book bc reading it just makes you hate the class more,0
"Not a great teacher, not much learning due to her reading straight from the power points (which were sometimes WRONG). Graded off four tests , lab and a case study. ,but only because most of the class failed. Talked too much about personal life and crocheting. was not patient with students and expressed it.",0
This was an excellent class and I recommend it to anyone interested in algae or even just plants in general. Vinebrooke made it extremly interesting and class was never boring. There was a lot of work in the class so bewarned but he is a fiar marker and gives extenstions. Overal great prof!,1
Michelle hunt is an absolute queennnnnnn. lots of lecturing but she makes everything make sense. will take questions in class and answers them thoroughly. literally the cutest little lady like 10/10 would want her as my grandma,1
Amazing prof. The final exam was really creative and interesting.,1
"She makes class mandatory but shows up late, grades papers late and doesn't help you understand the material well I would not take.",0
Learnt a lot form this prof in my course last year. Very engaging and approachable,1
A bit too perky for a morning class and really gets mad if you're late or talk in class. Be prepared to take notes and follow his fast powerpoint. Gives partial credit for attempted problems on tests and this can save you in his class. Always TRY every problem and you'll be ok!,1
"Woah, I think it's pretty extreme to transfer because of ONE teacher in ONE class. I found Professor London clear, interested in the material and organized in leading discussions. She let you revise papers and books assigned were varied and enjoyable.",1
"A good deal of the class is ""Group Work"" meaning you'll be teaching each other from printed worksheets. It's frustrating to pay tuition and be taught by an 18 year old group member. I could have stayed home and watched Khan Academy videos and learned more. When you're paying tuition,  you want to learn from someone with a PhD and experience.",0
"Not the worst teacher in the world, at least compared to what I've heard about last semesters. But holy cow I don't understand the point of this class, everything he's gone over has already been taught in previous CS classes, so you just sit there while he over explains things that other teachers taught in four minutes that takes him an hour.",0
"Excellent professor, very helpful.",1
"I had an APA guidebook (2020 ed.) that I consulted religiously during assignments, and he still always found ""massive problems"" with my formating. Feedback was always given late. I don't like not being able to find redeeming qualities about professors, but Burck made it very hard for me to find something positive about him and the course.",0
Great class!  He was a great professor.  Make sure to do the reading!,1
His homework requirements sheet is vague and everyone could come up with their own interpretation but you will be graded based on how close you can get to his interpretation of the question and close to someones solution he thinks is the best. His grading is very strict and unfair at times.,0
"He is overall a pretty good professor, but the class would be a bit challenging for new coming freshmen with a little experience in Python. I did learn a lot from this class. No tests during online class, only programming assignments (not very hard), five projects (take time), and a final project(It is basically a large programming assignment)",1
"Wonderful man! His World Lit class made me think about stuff I have never pondered before. His class is very discussion-based, and I learned so much through this style of learning. I would love to take another class with him-- very enthusiastic, easy class, amazing professor!! Cares about his students a lot. Take World Lit with him if you can!!!",1
"Took class online. He is very slow with grading, and very rarely responmds to emails. 2 exams on campus. 1st exam contained stuff that was not in the book. Simnet is amazing and easy...Mr Douglas seems not to care and seeems very unorganized. Very poor instruction.Book is very helpful, but if you are looking for clarity he is not helpful at all",0
I loved her class very good information to learn from. Everything was exactly from the book so if you read the chapters you will do very good but if you don't read then I don't know what to say. It was a very easy class if you read and she does offer extra credit just in case you need a boost in grade.,1
"I don't know what I was thinking taking his class. The class seem okay at first, but after a week it took a big turn. Essays back to back. Even going to his office hours plenty of times, there was NO improvement. He is a harsh grader and he makes it hard to pass. Don't take his class.",0
"This was one of the most enjoyable classes Ive ever taken. I dont like math at all and I looked forward to his class every Tuesday and Thursday night. His class is so relaxed, he jokes with the students and gives them candy, and he cares about every one of his students. I absolutely recommend his class.",1
"awful unclear professor, hard exams, unclear expectations",0
"She scares me. I mean, I walked into the class and afterwards got on the phone and was like ""daddy, my production teacher scares me."" Also, if she says you need a text book (prod.2) You Don't. We didn't use it once. She gets nicer the longer you're in class but still first impressions are everything. And she scared me.",1
"Ms. Battista is not a fair grader. The online quizzes constitute a large portion of your grade; however, they are on material that is not covered or provided. Essentially, you are walking into the dark with no preparation or access to information, while being graded. The only way to do well on these quizzes is through luck.",0
"If youre okay with taking a class by a professor who is unorganized then this is the class for you. On the first day he didnt show up because he forgot he had a class. Hes VERY unorganized, and confusing. He gives out 3 different assignments every class, he does not explain what he wants you to do. He doesnt listen and is not very helpful at all.",0
You'll learn a lot of useful things in this class whether you're a male-bodied person or female bodied person. But do know that a lot of views in this class are very strongly leaned in one side. But they admit it and are open about it. Read and memorize a lot. 3 exams. papers have weird standards. depends on TA. Lecture is very engaging. iclicker,1
Due dates basically don't matter.  I honestly think you could turn in every single assignment on the day of the final exam and he probably wouldn't care.  I thought he did a great job teaching this class.  He is very helpful if you need help and gives good feedback on assignments.  I recommend his AutoCAD class,1
Very nice prof but shouldn't be teaching anymore. You think you understand but during the exam it feels like you don't know anything. Would recommend taking another prof for ECON 227 since it's mandatory for Econ majors. Go to his office hours and work A LOT on your own if you want a good grade.,0
DO NOT EVER SIGN UP FOR THIS PROFESSOR. He is not interesting or interested. He will not work with you. He thinks the only reason you exist is for his class. There were massive withdrawals for my class. I am an A+ student and I was getting C-. DO NOT BELIEVE THE OTHER COMMENTS OR YOU WILL REGRET IT.,0
"Hard to follow.  Really nice person, but jumps around a lot.  Not great at explaining things.",0
"Absolutely take Professor Stevenson if you have the opportunity to, she is amazing! Had her for lecture and lab and received A in both. Tells you exactly what to study for exams and what's on them. Holds her own review sessions outside class so attend those! She actually cares and wants you to learn. Is a very hard grader though, so know material.",1
"Simple straight forward class, took it online. Please do not complain and cry about how many assignments are due. It's a very short online class, 20 assignments altogether - 3 exams (with reviews) you can easily pass them if you do the reviews, the other 17 things to do are simple. Easy A",1
"THE worst. I took AP English in high school and passed it with flying colors as one of the top writers in my class. I get to Shamane's class and I'm told that my use of grammar is ""offensive"" and that I'm too ""flowery"" and wordy in my writing. Passed with a 4.0 overall and on the portfolio bc I am a strong writer despite her comments. AVOID HER!!!",0
"this guy is a freaking moron, and it is a shame that you must take classes with him...he doesn't teach **** and expects you to know everything..should be fired",0
Booorrrrriiinnnggg. Pretty dry topic and he doesn't bother to spice it up. Plus he's just kind of a jerk. I somehow got a B+ in the class so I'm sure there was a curve. There's a legend that no one gets lower than a C after final exams cause his class is so hard. Not sure if this is the truth but wouldn't bank on it. AVOID if you can!,0
"Prof. Nguyen is amazing!!! I don't feel regrettable at all when taking organic class with this helpful and funny Professor :)... At the beginning, you will think he is tricky cuz he gives very long and tough exams; however, he also gives you many knowleges those are very good for you in higher classes. Do hw, study hard and ask questions! Easy A!",1
asynchronous class but made a lot of effort to keep certain synchronous zoom field trips. always available and EASY EASY class for physical breadth. learned a lot about earthquakes too v good class,1
"During her lectures, she would speak unclearly and move at her own pace. Yes she waited a few seconds, but always hurries to the next problem. At the end of the day, I would have to go home, view examples from the mylabsplus, and teach myself. She is very cooperative and polite though when you are speaking one on one with her.",0
she talks too much.,0
"Smart but tough. I'm not a bad/lazy student but I do struggle in this class. Midterm & final assignment are worth a huge chunk of your grade. If you don't do well on one or both, it is unlikely you will be able to pass. He can seem arrogant but will sometimes clarify. Very tough. Take notes/pay attn. Not super awful but I wouldn't take him again.",0
He just isn't a good teacher. He knows the material for Technical Theatre but has no clue as to what it takes to teach a class. He can be very rude and derogatory to students and doesn't understand how to teach in a way that students can understand. I didn't have a problem in the class and got out with an A but most weren't as lucky.,0
"I took this professor for psychology of media and she was amazing. The class is real simple, you watch movies and write essays about them and you learn how psychology is displayed in films and different movies. I definitely recommend if you're looking for an easy A!",1
Amit has got to be my favorite professor thus far. He is incredibly caring and takes time to help each of his students. He goes above and beyond by offering extra homework or problems and even holding multiple review sessions. He truly cares that his students succeed. Explains difficult concepts very easily too.,1
Professor Zimmerman is not doing well in the virtual world. She doesnt post assignments when she says she will and gives feedback on assignments after they are due. She forgot to give my class a midterm so suddenly made the final worth 40 percent. On the final she included content she never taught and posted a ppt so we could teach ourselves.,0
"Didn't feel like I got enough out of the teacher. The class was great and I learned a lot, but I wish the teacher would have helped more. Constantly had to ask for additional instructions. I was extremely ill and he gave me a redo on an assignment, but only for a couple more hours. I wrote him when I was super sick.",0
"all I can say is ""ohhh my god!""",0
I can't imagine a school like atlanta metro will employ a person like this to teach in their institution.This guy is not a graduate i thought one of the criteria for employing teachers in a college is a masters degree.This guy is terrible and oh there is more stuff.Please if anyone could avoid his class it will help alot.Because he is a facilitator,0
If you want to learn Japanese. Do it with Matsushima!,1
This teacher is useless make sure if you get her run. Her grading is ridiculous and grades you down for the wrong reasons. She has her favorites and her tone of voice is very annoying. DONT TAKE HER!!!!!!!!!!,0
"Jennie is an amazing calculus teacher!  She makes complicated topics much simpler, and she really cares about her students and wants everyone to succeed!  She loves math, which makes her classes fun!  She will help you succeed and will probably make you like calculus too!",1
extremely tough grader. on all assignments I didn't get any higher then a 70% I highly recommended avoiding her class. She takes forever to grade assignments i turned in 3 assignments and she took the entire quarter to grade all of them and took 3 hrs to grade my final.,0
"nice guy, great proffesor, a little much for a intro class but he makes it easy to learn and is very fair when it comes to grading, all in all a good guy and a good teacher.",1
"Please save yourself the trouble of taking this teacher. He is very disorganized, lost my essay the last day of class, made me buy an online tutor program which we didn't use, and grades very harshly. He teaches only through powerpoint and is not very good at it. I learned nothing in this class.",0
"Dr. Barnes is really funny and passionate but for a required freshmen course, she grades way too harshly on speeches. She doesnt realize we arent all communication majors. Also her stories are funny and interesting but classes are pointless because she spends 5 minutes on the material and then talks about herself and her family the whole class",0
"I've had him for 2 semesters and he is the bomb! He is literally a ""Dad."" I can stand chemistry bc of him. He is a great teacher with great lectures, and shows many examples in class. The book does most of the teaching, and we have weekly sapling problems, but it is a fair amount of work for college chemistry. Best chem 1 & 2 professor at Drake!",1
"Sanda's class was my favorite one of this entire semester. That said, there are always two sides to things. She's tough and she will tell it like it is. But she's also very light-hearted and funny. Put the work in and do what is asked of you and there are no issues. Fight for your work though. You'll learn so much from Sanda about design.",1
"She is not for those who are not passionate about medieval history.  I am and as such gained a plethora of knowledge (I have taken her four times).  Her writing assignments are very difficult.  She is not looking for regurgitation of previously covered material, but original analytical thought, as in what historians do.  I highly recommend her.",1
A nice guy overall. He is easier to pass than most other NCSU profs bc he curves everything heavily. Grading is 95% from 5 exams. He does not indicate what will actually be important so you have to study everything and then might have several questions on info from one slide while entire chapter is ignored. Use outside resources and you'll be fine.,0
"I took this class online last summmer, and everything was going well until I got the due date of the final paper confused with due dates for 2 other final papers I had. Needless to say, explaining myself to this professor proved absolutely fruitless and she failed me anyway. I don't think I will ever get over it...",0
She was always giving us homework at 12 at night and expected us to complete it by the morning 8 30 class. Dont take her class at NJIT. Not worth the time.,0
"Best math teacher ive ever had.  I am terrible at math, dont understand it aT ALLL!! boyer is great.  He doesnt rush through the material, he spends a whole class or two on just one concept, which really helps.  he teaches well and is easy to understand.  I highly recommend this class to ANYONEE!!! takee it!",1
She is a very nice teachers sweetheart even. But she doesn't know how to speak English very well. her test are easy if you understand what she taught you. I basically had to either teach myself or go to the math lab like everyday. Because I didn't understand her I ended up failing.,0
"Extremely clear, well paced prof. His decent sense of humor also helps. You really can't ask for much more. On a subjective note, I found the actual course content itself to be terribly boring, but that's not his fault... just my bad luck for having to take a course in which I have no intrinsic interest.",1
"I have not had math for a long, long time and Lisa made this refresher course interesting and easy to understand.  She takes the time to go over exactly what will be on each exam and will review again and again if needed.  Attendance was not mandatory but it's probably hard to pass without attending.  Her explanations were helpful.",1
"If youre good at memorizing, take him. His tests are solely based off few things from the horribly boring book he assigns and random things he says in lecture. Pay attention and youll make an easy A. He truly wants you to succeed in life. Hes very awkward at times which is funny. Too bad you have to show up since his class is easy.",1
"Its like having that miserable Italian grandma next door as your professor. You have to love her because shes Italian, but man she has no buisness teaching in the year 2020",0
Schubert's Math 5A class was difficult. He expects you to know everything that he's teaching already. He works on problems on the board and basically solves it & talks to himself and asks the class if what he was doing was right and that's basically the whole lecture. He doesn't teach you how to solve the problem or say why he's solving it that way,0
Great  teacher. I learned alot in this class. The most interesting class so far in Psy,1
This lady is NUTS! Avoid taking this course with her if you can! Take my advice please! You will be better off taking this course with somebody else!,0
"Dr. Lim is a very nice guy, but a very mediocre professor. He never derived a problem from scratch for us and instead just scrolled through his notes which looked like alphabet soup. We all had to teach ourselves by doing the homework and reading the notes. Many grades were saved because he leaked the final while we took it, invalidating it.",0
"Amazing teacher.  Awesome personality, so nice, helpful, I could go on and on.  She will only give two exams all semester: midterm and final exam.  Both are take home, open book, open note.  Easy A with such a great teacher.  I'm honestly going to miss her",1
He's a great guy.,1
"Dylan is a great teacher and a great guy.  He gives assignments every week and they are cumulatively part of a group film package project. Come to every class, pay attention, and read the book. He is helpful; if you ever email him with a question or concern, he responds with astonishing promptness. You will learn a lot and get good experience.",1
Overall not a good class. Basically you have to teach your self as there is no class and everything is online. I would not recommend her online class.,0
"Dr Picault is a very nice guy and generally very approachable in office hours. But you really have to get used to his lecturing style: there were weekly only quizzes  and 4 multiple choice midterms. Final exam was a long and moderately hard (multiple choice). No diagrams, no analysis. Very lazy assessment, you won't learn a lot  of economics here",1
"If rate my professor would allow me to give this woman a 0, I would. Horribly rude and disrespectful. She is one of the most unreasonable people I have ever dealt with in my entire life. The final was nothing we ever learned in class so good luck.",0
Exam is based on a set of questions handed out in the beginning. Material is very difficult and his style of teaching makes it more complicated. Case study presentations must be very detailed.,0
He doesn't work with you ever. Nice personality but i wish I went elsewhere for my classes because I can't tell you what I've gotten out of his class.,0
"This professor is way too difficult. She is extremely confusing and drops a load of work on you from the start. The class just started for me and I instantly regret this taking her. I don't know how I'm going to pass this. If you're looking for a chill and normal PSYC class, this is not it. This is for the people that like to work very very hard.",0
She is very condescending and patronizes students. Not helpful and just plan rude. Avoid taking this class if you can.,0
"Honestly one of the best professors I've had at U of M. Provides a fun learning environment, as well as real life tools, and skills to utilize them. His teaching style helps you understand the topics very well and critically. Lots of fun examples, and in-class discussions. Tests are difficult, but what test isn't... Projects are actually fun though",1
"I personally think that this class is interesting. BUT, he is really is a tough grader. It is like you will never be able to get good grades after all. To those assignments that he gave I think should not be graded harshly like that!",0
"I spent so many HOURS a week on this class and am doing fine in lab but legit am scared that I'm going to fail and have to repeat the course. Tests are crazy hard, lab is hard and hw's are the only thing that can bring your grade up so DO THEM",0
"For starters, I had no interest in this class and I still don't but he made it bearable. He uses powerpoint which tends to be interesting. The tests he gives you are all take home so thats a plus. He assigns about 3-4 major papers and grades them liberally. Not a hard class. Just do the work you're assigned and You'll be fine.",1
Don't take this professor. TERRIBLE. If you're not strong in math you will fail. Expects you to know how to do everything and moves way too fast when doing example problems. If you have a question on how to do something she will tell you that you should already know it from previous classes or to read the text book or watch the videos (unhelpful),0
"She's a tough grader, which is bad enough considering she doesn't teach class online. It's basically do it yourself. The deadline is at 10 instead of 11:59pm like the other classes. She's very strict about turning assignments in on time even if you have valid excuse as to why you couldn't turn it in. If you take this class, be prepared.",0
"Must come to class as she doesnt post notes. Must read textbook in addition to notes from lectures or you wont do well. Took forever to mark, never answered emails, and cancelled class/had substitutes often. Gave little to no information about what to expect on the midterm or the final. Would not take a class with her again.",0
No clue why he has good grades. He has been unreasonable durning the coronavirus transition and even before was a hard ass for an intro class. Nice and funny guy but somehow makes his own classes unenjoyable. Can learn a lot but if you want an easy A def avoid.,0
"WORST PROFESSOR IVE HAD AT DAVIS. Im a math major. Temple is not a good teacher. He may be good at his research, but he is deplorable at teaching. Look at all the other reviews. I cannot think of one thing I like about his class. No textbook, no homework, no feedback, no communication, no planning. Only take him if you are an effective self-teacher",0
"This guy is the freakin boss, man...He knows his stuff and he's a total bro. Unfortunately the class only counts as an I&E, but...man oh man. I learned so much. And if you're having trouble, just talk to him and his wife...they are so helpful and understanding. Def take this course if you're interested in the biz. You won't regret it.",1
"Great lecturer, interesting life stories before class, has a lot of knowledge on policy and law and relates it to everyday life. You can catch up with podcasts which is super helpful if you commute. Readings are not too long compared to other Classes and if you do them and go to class its easy to do well. Test are fair. Super interesting material!",1
"He was an awesome spanish teacher, constantly updated our assignments, percentages, breakdowns, and grades online, so you always knew how you were doing in class. Tests are easy if you pay attention in class and do the class/homework.  Couldnt have picked a better teacher! You use the textbook everyday, so buy it!",1
"He was an amazing teacher. I would recomend him to everyone. He picks out a small and super easy textbook, which is also cheap. He makes it so easy to understand statistics. He trys to be funny and most of the time he is. He gives a lot of extra points on quizzes and tests. He even gave take home tests. Best teacher I've had!!",1
Legace was amazing as a professor. I took his IQL recently and he was very understanding. I had computer issues so I wasn't able to get all my homework done but he was very understanding and allowed me to hand in the homework late. Also really into sports. Highly recommend him. One of the best professors I've had here in the past two years.,1
"Tough lady and intimidating at first, but then as the class goes on, you realize that she's actually really cool! She's smart and really wants to hear your thoughts on things. Turned out to be one of my favorite professors. And definitely one of the more ""normal"" honors professors.",1
"I honestly got enrolled into this Lifespan Development Online Course for first time through enhanced computerized version learning methodology skills, thus transitioning from D2L to eLearning Canvas Instructure System automatically dropped me from this program. Unfortunately, I requested HELP many times from CRC Counseling and Dean WITHOUT SUCCESS.",0
"She is all over the place, she tries to assign us homework that we've already done. I don't blame her though, all the busy work she gives us is the same. She gave me a 0 on accident and I asked her every class period for two weeks to change the grade on moodle and she still hasn't. Get it together girl.",0
"She is by far the most rude professor I've ever had when responding to questions and never answers the student properly, instead just telling them to read the textbook again. The content of the final assignment was entirely around coding in R when the there has been literally no content covering R until that point. An absolute embarrassment.",0
"Margo is an horrifying prof. I've never been so incredibly bored in an anthropology class before. Literally reads off the slides, no new information is given, speaks ONLY about Brazil- in fact my class mate and I have taken to rolling our eyes every time she mentions Brazil, which means our eyes are CONSTANTLY ROLLING. AVOID THIS PROF.",0
"Amazing Professor, show up to class; study the notes for an easy A!",1
Great professor! I would definitely recommend him to anybody for learning frameworks.,1
legend!,1
super boring class.. lots of reading and essays every week.. be prepared to fall asleep.. requires attendance and participation!!,0
"Her tests are about 25-30 questions, but doesn't curve grades. Lots of homework assigned- she only checks it if you're late/absent. Lectures are sometimes hard to follow. Don't miss class you'll miss so much, she covers a lot very quickly. She also only uses a chalkboard, so don't take her class if you have a problem with chalk noises.",0
"This was by far my favorite class at USC because of both the material covered & Paul Young himself. The guys an absolute legend who truly cares about all of his students. If you have the chance, take one of his classes.",1
"This class was a little difficult, but you are given all the resources to pass, on the first day. Yashica is very easy going and understanding. She gives a couple chances to pass the weekly tests. The textbook wasn't the best; I learned more from KhanAcademy, which is recommended in her syllabus. Just be ready to put in time with this course.",1
"This teacher was not very accessible. Her answers to questions were not clear, and I had to have her clarify most of the time. Since it was an online class, I could read other students' frustration with the same issue. She also took a long time to reply to questions.",0
"Dr. Leikand words his exams and quizzes in ways that do not follow the text or his lectures. I find myself constantly confused, and I have read the textbook cover to cover. This class is structured where you read half of a chapter, take a quiz, then you have lecture on what you read, after you've already taken the quiz.",0
"Great teacher. Easy going and extremely approachable. Accounting is a boring topic, so do not expect flamethrowers and circus freaks to make the class more enjoyable. However, she makes the class interesting by inspiring us with her personal experiences (she is an accountant and business owner). Learned a lot from her.",1
"Honestly, I hated his class. He came off as a nice guy at first but was close minded and rude to people who had other ideas. If you disagreed with his ideas he hated you the rest of the term. He assigned way too much reading for a 244 class. He's a great teacher for suck ups but if you aren't a brown noser and think for yourself watch out.",0
"This is the easiest class you will ever take.  He gives you the exact answers to the midterm and final so you have to really try to NOT do well.  He's goofy but has a good heart.  Easy, easy A.",1
"I wanted to do a french minor until I met this guy. He is literally the worst person I have ever met, he is racist, sexist and misogynistic. I honestly don't know how he has kept a job interacting with the public. Be ready to be picked on in class and made fun of if you're wrong. Avoid at all costs",0
"Professor Benefiel is not a teacher you want. I am an all A student and received a 72 in his class that was originally supposed to be a 69. His lectures are unclear, he doesn't answer questions (rather beats around the bush), his tests are hard with 6-8 questions and he barely helps you. Do NOT get this professor. Good luck if you do. (MCC not OCC)",0
Teaching is not her thing. Couldn't understand her. Got a tutor and still failed the class. Screwed up my GPA. Totally not worth it. Over half of my class failed. STAY AWAY!,0
"She's sweet, but lectures fast. The amount of work is OUTRAGIOUS.(Took as refresher, I've taken several A&P classes over the yrs, took this one 7yr ago, earned a B) Exams are NOT what are on the objectives, quizzes dont help w/ lecture exams. DO NOT take if you have other classes or work full time. This class takes 4-6 HOURS every DAY to keep up.",0
"Isn't clear in directions and blames students when they don't know what to do. I passed this class but worked harder than ever, not because he was tough on me, because he doesn't know what he wants. In my opinion, you should only need to get help from TAs and GAs if you are struggling, it should not be an essential part of passing.",0
"Can get a worst teacher, makes next to no sense, you'll need to watch many Youtube videos or get help elsewhere just to understand what he even talked about in class. Avoid at all cost if possible!",0
You will do a majority of your work through MyLabMath with almost no communication with the teacher herself and when you do talk to her she is always aggressive and hardheaded. Your entire semester grade is essentially just the two exams and that's it since she weighs their grade so heavily.,0
"Her classes were interesting and thought-provoking. She does not use the book, but uses selections that make you think and also help you be aware of writing. Do not take her class if you are easily offended; she is not offensive, but she uses some provocative material that makes you think and discuss.",1
"If there is any possible way to avoid his classes, DO SO!  He is a very smart man, but has absolutely 0 teaching ability.",0
"I took organic 2 and chem 101 Kiesewetter. A lot of people like her because she is bubbly in comparison to other chemistry professors. However, she is not a good teacher. I learned all the material on my own, and she is not very helpful with explaining things. She will just go through problems and expect people to conform to how she does things.",0
Listens and adapts to students' concerns. Knows his stuff and cares about students' knowledge.,1
"Outstanding Professor comparing with my learning experiences in professional courses at Universities in Canada, India and Africa. Great student engaging and performance supporting teaching methodology. An awesome personality who is very professional, helpful, friendly, open minded and supports students to reach our professional goals.",1
"I am in her class this semester and LOVE it. It is hard enough that I feel motivated to study, but easy enough that it isn't scary. She is so funny and gives a lot of real world examples. She doesn't post the lecture slides online but she does give out  A LOT of material to make sure that you are ready for your exam.",1
"This is probably the hardest class I have ever taken. He is a great guy, but the exams are borderline impossible no matter how much work you put into studying. The work he has us do and the exams are made so much harder than they have to be. This class is about to destroy my gpa because I didn't listen to the other reviews on here...",0
She is a cute little old lady and thinks she's super funny but her jokes are so cheesy. You have a textbook but it isn't than expensive. If you don't read don't stress she gives the notes the next day. You only have three papers and they're straight forward. She wants to see you do well and get a good grade in the class.,1
"Terrible Teacher, doesn't teach, has trouble staying on track.",0
"Seems like a good guy, but one of the WORST classes I've ever had to endure. I just came here to get transfer credit back to my college. The class is easy to get an A IMO, but the quality of lectures/education is god awful. The lectures videos are extremely low quality so you can't see what he's writing and his accent makes it impossible to hear.",0
"If theres anyone that can take an easy concept and explain it in such a way that leaves you more confused than when you started, then this is your guy. He's smart but he's not a good teacher. This guy needs to go back to working for some company because HE CANT TEACH.",0
"If you are not electrical engineering, do not take him. He is a research professor, not a teaching professor. I took every AP Physics in high school, did the homework, studied for hours for the test an failed. He gave a 3 question test that was 9 parts total. The class average was a 44% and he does not curve. He does not care about your grade.",0
"Be prepared to go to lectures and leave the same way you entered, without any new knowledge.",0
He's a really chill professor who wants to see everyone do well. Definitely make sure you go to class and try to participate!,1
"Great professor! You have to read and go to class to get a solid grade. Very fair, group project can be tough but totally worth it you learn a lot from the class. Professor Carr was completely engaged and office hours were great resource. Last note the quizzes are the hardest part, recommend flash cards and Read in class notes.",1
"Tells you the average for the class will be a B but really it will be closer to a C. Wastes time in class talking about his own stocks along with other pointless things and will put random stuff on tests hes never talked about. Not a good marketing teacher for 300 but i'm not sure about other classes. good guy, sub par teacher.",0
Dr. Tour frequently inserts his personal political beliefs into the course. He is unforgiving and does not like most students.,0
Professor Smith was great. She was easy to reach via email or office hours and was very understanding when it comes to grading. Do the work and you'll pass. ,1
"Although attendance is required, don't pay any attention to her lectures. Study straight from the book.She wants very detailed answers and is a little nitpicky when it comes to grading. She does curve, and if she doesn't get to a topic, she will delay tests. Everything is straight memorization from the book. If you're good at that, you'll get an A",0
Summer online class. WARNING! Requirements include a webcam that must be on you during exams and quizzes at least and wants to see the entire room you are in. No one can be in the room with you. Did not work for me as I have small kids in the house. No compliance  a 0. NOT HELPFUL! Did not respond to course messages. Requires Mindtap. I dropped it,0
"At the end of the term, my whole class agreed that we would miss the lectures, but not the course. The lectures genuinely made my day sometimes, just because the environment was so friendly and fun--which is a weird thing to say, but still. Read the textbook, do your homework, study hard, and go to office hours if necessary, and you'll be okay.",1
"This class wasn't too bad. Professor D. is a good teacher. The class itself was good for a math idiot like me; straight and to the point, no B.S. I'd suggest you take her if you want to get through the class without too much trouble.",1
"I absolutely loved Jose! Amazing and inspirational! Great lectures and truly made me excited to come to class everyday! I took so much from this class, HIGHLY recommend !",1
You can tell he knows his stuff but it is kind of difficult understanding what he's teaching. Tests are difficult.,0
"She is a good researcher, but defintely not a good lecturer. My mind went blank soon after listening to her. Lecture slides are pointless and reading the textbook is a must to pass. Even if you do so you still miss points due to the unncessary details and confusion you will see the MC questions during the tests. Be warned.",0
"If you go to class, you are going to do fine. A lot goes on in class with lectures, discussion topics, and group work. She's experienced and thoughtful with her answers to our questions. I want to take another class of her's again.",1
"Nice guy, but he drags his lessons out soooo much. It could seriously take 15 minutes. I can't listen to him because I get so bored and distracted. A nice class to work on homework from another class though!",0
"He goes through the material very quickly. Class was relatively pointless except to turn in homework (which is graded!) Review sessions were pointless, and the previous exams he posts are nothing like the exams he gave my class. He is a nice enough guy, but you have to ask specific questions if you expect any help from him.",0
"Dr. B is a caring professor. Computational Biology is his research area so he has a passion when coming into the class. For all of the machine learning algorithms he goes over, he does an excellent job of bringing the level of difficulty to a manageable level with simple explanations. Would take him for everything if I could.",1
"She is one of the best instructors I've had! I highly recommend taking her class!! Her class is interesting and very educational, I learned so much about communication. She cares about students and always gives great feedback. We had small group conversations and then shared with the class, so we got pretty close with each other.",1
"This is a difficult class, it is a language class after all. He makes everything seem more entertaining and he truly cares for each student that he has. It you want to take French i would definitely recommend him!",1
Dustin is the best engineering professor I have ever had. His testing is consistent with everything he teaches in class. Most of my classes with him required no book. He genuinely cares about his students and is always ready to help when you don't understand. Take every class that you can from him!,1
"McPherson is the best professor I've had so far. I went into his class expecting to hate every minute of it, but he is a fantastic teacher and explained the material extremely well. I would still read the textbook but he clarifies everything you may be confused on. Because of my experience in Chem I, I'm am now a chemistry minor too :)",1
"Dr. Jones is the best professor I've had. There is a lot of work, but it all goes into the final paper for the class. If you chose a topic that you're truly passionate about, the class is very enjoyable and something to look forward to. She lets you revise assignments within a week. intimidating but really cares about her students. Would recommend",1
Doesnt explain things to where everyone can understand. Expects everyone to learn the same. Makes you feel like youre stupid if you dont understand something.,0
"Gets offended by people not coming to class in a lecture with over 200 people. This is college, people shouldn't be punished in lecture courses. She does these industry exercises randomly in lecture throughout the semester so it keeps kids coming cause they dont know when they'll happen. First lecture I've never been able to use my phone or laptop.",0
I had him his first semester he taught undergrad when he was really hard. I hear he's gotten better since then though.,1
She kinda became the permanent sub for Murphy's ENC1101 in 2017 so I didn't really get a look into the way she would organize the class. She wants you to succeed and gives you many resources to do so but is a tough grader. If you enjoy English than you could thrive under her expectations but if you're looking to just get by take Eileen Murphy.,1
Just DO NOT DO IT!. spare yourself the time and money. I felt like I was getting ready for my board exams...,0
"Professor Yemut is awful. He doesn't care about you learning, he is hard to understand and leaves class early. He teaches exactly out of the textbook and expects you to do the rest. Test are heavy, but he does give partial credit if you do part of the problem wrong. If you work on your own, you will pass the class, just don't expect him to help.",0
"She was okay in the beginning, but overtime was last minute on things. It took forever to get any grades back. Our project was started later than it needed to be. I enjoyed the group project where you work with a real company and do their marketing. My group members were great. Also Karani did not like me bc of where I live and I found that rude.",0
"-presentations sound like the announcer for 'The Price is Right', very annoying -takes 3-4 days on average to respond to forum questions -poorly narrated 1-2 hour slideshows, run them at 1.5x to bypass dead-air and slow speech -slideshows are recycled, you can HEAR older errors prior student reviews, ""he's fun!"". gee, this ain't middle school",0
"Professor Valvo cares a lot about her students. I am taking her for a writing intensive course and I highly recommend her! Read what you are assigned, complete the in class assignments and homework, and you will make the grade you want. She is always available to answer any questions that her students have.",1
"He is an amazing teacher and knows his stuff. If you don't work hard don't take his class. He is one of the people that pioneered touch screens and the beginning  of  ATM machines. He also developed for IBM, Apple and Adobe. His work with photoshop and Illustrator for Adobe set the groundwork how to use the program.  Great Professor!",1
"She's pretty entertaining and likes to talk. Class is fun, but watch out--she may accidentally spoil the latest TV show you're watching (Game of Thrones...). She is very friendly if you need help but she treats students like they're in elementary school. She'll get on to you for not looking straight at her during lab. ",1
"Mrs. Jackson's class will change your life. She is easy to talk to and exceptionally willing to help you and will make you feel at home. Some classes were a little like group therapy, and she gives you tools to lead a happier, more mindful life. I was nervous about taking this class, but it has had a huge impact on my life, and I'm glad I took it.",1
She's extremely vague and doesn't really respect students' time.  She also takes attendance.  But she's not the worst prof. ever.,0
She does absolutely nothing for her class or her students and shes supposed to teach how to tend to exceptional learners but doesnt practice it herself . Oxymoron of a professor if you ask me,0
Confusing professor who is never available during her posted office hours. Will belittle you when you ask for help outside of class. Out of 24 students she sent emails to 19 suggesting they see the calculus tutor instead of asking her for help. Very confusing way of grading exams with no partial credit. Do yourself a favor and skip this professor!,0
Hes not good at teaching. He doesnt work with his students AT ALL. So dont expect to talk to him about where your grade is at and him help you succeed or do better. I wish I didnt waste my time and money in this class. In the 6 years of going to college Ive never been more frustrated with a class. Dont waste your time with this one.,0
Dr Dudley is the best. This class was an intersession class but was completely manageable to knock out in less than 4 weeks. Professor responds quickly and gives great feedback AND he is very encouraging! Take his class! I wish I could take him for all my psych classes! This class sets you up to pass and succeed for the next psych class! Thanks Dr,1
I was very disappointed with Mrs. Dudleys class!! she is very passive aggressive and very monotone during lectures. During labs she talks for a good hour n a half before you even start the labs. I do not recommend if you're looking for a bio teacher that is approachable and wiling to work with you.,0
Rude and demeaning. She doesn't care about her students. She goes over your head and never bothers to clear anything up. She may know the material but can't teach it. ,0
"Putnam was a decent professor, but if you don't like legal theory, pass on Just 401. Lectures were a bit dry, but it's a pretty easy class as long as you show up.  There are easy iclicker quizzes almost every class and his doesn't post powerpoints so if you don't go to class and refuse to read the book you're screwed.",1
I took my soci class online and I was easy. But I used the study guide on the test and made 80s and 90s on every test. The TA is really nice and theres not much work in this class,1
"I took about 3 or 4 classes with Dr. B and she was also my research advisor. While her classes require a lot of attention, if you actively participate, you will make it through. She is very kind and welcoming and loves when students ask questions, so don't be afraid to speak up! Also, just be prepared for her to take your phone during tests :)",1
"she's a lunatic, whatever you do, DONT take her class. She's more uptight than a high school teacher. Counts 2 tardies as an absence and 2 absences and she will drop you from the course. Also, she is the LEAST understanding professor I have ever met, she went over on class time every class and made multiple students late to their next class",0
"DEFINITELY take her. Overall she gives quizzes each week, but they are fairly easy, there is no limit on how many times you take it, she takes the highest you get. there's only one written assignment through the semester but again it's very easy. At the end of course she gives opportunities. She cares, wish more prof were like her :)",1
I had a lot of hope for this class and this professor. I have found Dr. Saunders very condescending when you are asking questions and seems aloof despite trying to make jokes in class. He flies through the PPT and excel examples. He says attendance doesn't count but will hand out random extra credit on a whim. Class is a drag and I am disappointed.,0
I barely went to class... just for the review and tests. Going to class will just confuse you because all she does is drag on topics and uses big words for no reason. Her power points are literally just words without explanations. The only reason I got a B- was because I never went to class and just read out of the book.,0
"Very helpful! Never a moment to be board in her classes. She's by far the most enthuiastic, on task, and organized professor ive ever had. Very flexable for students with full time jobs. I had her with 2 CDEV classes and she was conistant in both and just as encouraging.",1
"Twyla is a nice person and seems to care about her students, but constantly cancels classes and shows up late. If you're a punctual person, do not take her classes. She is also an extremely tough grader and offers little to no feedback.",0
"Haldane loves her job so much and she really shows that passion in her lectures and when she speaks. Very influential and makes you really think about anthropology. There is quite a bit of reading, but she goes over them and you can ask her if you do not understand the readings. Just do the discussion boards and reading and you should do fine.",1
"Super easy class. I am really bad at math but this prof really helps you out. She curves everything. There are a lot of homeworks and a few quizzes and tests, but she goes over almost exactly the qs that are gonna be on them during review. Do have to buy a code for Pearson which is $$$",1
Dr Hill is a wonderful professor. He isn't easy but it's because he really wants you to learn about life and bio. He is so willing to have interesting group discussions and to answer any questions you have. Study hard for the tests. They are not easy but he will help you as much as you ask for help. Can't say enough. One of my fave teachers ever.,1
"I have never disliked an English class so much, and Im an English major! Mike doesnt like his students and obviously has some insecurity issues because he uses his job to make himself feel better. He has no clear grading criteria, asks for 3 papers a week, gives pop quizzes, and is flat out unprofessional and rude in his feedback. DO NOT TAKE HIM",0
Not sure how this guy has such a high score. He did a terrible job explaining lectures online and they were short and uninformative. He included stuff that wasnt really covered on exams and homework. Maybe he does a better job in person :/,0
"First things first, Her tests are really hard. It is like she wants you to fail. Its like the tests came out of a different book. I did OK in her class but I had to try really hard. I usually get A's in math, but not in this class, mainly because of the tests. Overall she does a good job. Did I say the tests are hard?",1
I cannot express enough how terrible of a person professor Renner is. She is condescending and treats her students like grade school children. Class isn't overtly difficult as long as you keep up with textbook reading and take notes from the reading.,0
Prof. Kim decided to make it so that the only way to view his lectures was to see them live. If you are an international student do not take this class due to time zone problems. If you are a domestic student still avoid him because his refusal to upload is a clear sign of being an egomaniac who demands your presence to pad his fragile educator ego,0
Great dude and a great teacher.,1
"In the first couple of weeks of classes, Stan was spending a lot of time talking about his own personal life and his son. He mentioned how he cares more about his son than teaching here... um ok Stan, you don't need to tell us that just put some effort and be more alive when you teach and stop being so stressed and maybe let a new instructor teach",0
"Although the amount of work given was too much for a first-year course, and I did poorly in his class, he really inspired me to become and better writer and reader. His classes were too long, and my attention span was easily lost. He should not be teaching at UFV (lol). To me, he is a genius and should be teaching at a better university.",1
I was miserable waking up to this class. He taught from the textbook and still didn't explain things well. I had to learn everything myself and barely get the points to get an A. His HW and class work never resembled the test. He yelled at many students including me numerous times just for asking a simple question or being courteous. He is rude af.,0
"Nice guy but I hate his class. A lot of homework and projects. Also, have a midterm and final. he grades really harshly and ridiculous. If you're not very familiar with excel and access microsoft don't take his class.",0
"Fantastic professor! Great to see someone who is so passionate about the material. Tough exams and tough marker, but a real teacher.",1
"She used to teach in Elementary school, and she runs her college class that way. She definitely cares for her student, but more in the ""overbearing mother"" kind of way. You might have to swallow your pride in order to pass.",0
"She is a nice lady, and can be  very accommodating, **BUT** as a teacher, she performed VERY poorly! She doesn't set clear expectations re: learning outcomes, is awfully disorganized grading ( often failing to provide feedback on quizzes & homework in time to keep you from making the same mistakes on the next test. Worst college teacher I've had!",0
"He sucks tbh. He wont let you ask other students for HELP (he considered it cheating) hell call you out for other students to see, rude, unprofessional, and a horrible source of help or guidance. Dont take.",0
"He's no doubt good at what he does but he's ... a little dry. His lectures are hard to take notes to. His readings are not accurate and I literally have no idea what the hell is going on. He's a good guy but there will be times you might be tempted to just not show. Just Hard to follow is what you need to know and very dry. Yet, a sweet man.",0
Excellent at involving you in the lecture and getting you excited and interested in everything psychology. One of TU's BEST professors!,1
This class was so hard I had drop this class if you are a full-time student I would not take this class. If you at home and take online classes then this is for you. Never answers your emails or if she does it is like a week after. WOULD NOT TAKE THIS CLASS.,0
She is not very clear on her assignments. She has an enormous amount of work for the class and unnecessary citations for discussions. She required you to have two peer reviewed journals for your responses to your classmates. She is less concerned about the content and more concerned with the structure of the papers. Hopefully won't have again!,0
His class is useless. talk about things he enjoys talking about not what students need to know. One of the worse prof I had.,0
"Best professor I have had thus far. HE IS AWESOME. Super interesting and his grading is very fair. Great teaching style, very understanding, and I had zero complaints.",1
"She shows inappropriate films for the age group. She is lazy and not tech savvy at all. You don't get any feedback until it's too late, she also has mixed material for the class. I took as an elective, she calls herself a ""historian"", I'm glad she's ancient history for me. This class is boring and serves no benefit, not even to a history major.",0
She taught straight from the slides so if you have the lecture manual you could basically teach yourself everything and still pass. She does not know how to answer abstract questions (if it's not on the slide she does not know the answer). Homework load was a lot but not too difficult. The textbook was not useful but the lecture manual was.,0
"Arnold is a enthusiastic and good teacher. I have had her in two classes. The amount of work in her class seems disproportionate to the credits, including one novel per week, and at least one short essay pr week. However the material is very interesting. She often gives rubrics for assignments (very clear in my eyes), but rarely returns graded work",1
Professor Petro is a great professor! I loved and enjoyed his class. His test are fair and he gives extra credit problems and a take home quiz. You have to keep up with the MyMathlab assignments in order to stay in track. I suggest that you go to every class to keep up.,1
"Prof Infante is such a nice and genuinely caring person. Despite the fact that I never understood a single reading and could probably, at the end of the semester, not tell you what this class is about I would take the course again in a heartbeat. It is rare you find a professor as nice and class discussion was always fun even when it was confusing!",1
"Very hard to understand, tests are not anything like the lectures, and the study guides he gives out are useless. There are a couple of map quizzes which are super easy and they bump your grade up a little from all of the difficult tests. I would not recommend this professor to anyone.",0
"When it comes to math, I have absolutely no understanding. Mr. Seals made me feel like a math wiz! His teaching method is one to be praised and he explains the lesson in a way that anyone can understand. By the way the guy is hilarious!",1
"He's awful. My advice for macro: 1. Don't waste your time going to class. Read the book for the hour and 15 minutes you have his class instead. It explains things much more clearly than he ever can. If you hate textbooks and need a good lecturer to learn, do not take him. You will fail 2. Memorize his packet practice questions for exams.",0
"If you want to learn history this is not the guy for you. If you want to learn how to read a ton of pages, write several papers, and take exams which are only free response and essays then Turkovic is your guy. Not my cup of team but maybe he is yours.",0
Got A's on every exam yet got a B for the final grade because I missed numerous clicker quizzes and in-class activities.. material not hard but you HAVE to go to class to get an A...,0
AVOID AT ALL COSTS,0
"Dr Costanza gives a fail-proof lecture in World Religion. You have a whole week to complete two short assignments, and some weeks there's only one assignment. A couple easy, short writing pieces, a brief anthropological study, and you're on your way to an A! A passionate teacher, but often unforgiving about missing class or work.",1
"Nice and funny professor, but a tough grader, especially on the papers. If I didnt do all her extra credit, I probably wouldnt have gotten an A-. Do all her assignments and you should pass. She can be strict when she has to be but shes also very bubbly and funny.",1
"Wike overall was very good, but an extremely tough grader. It is next to impossible to get perfects, or near perfect scores on anything. I am not at all interested in the healthcare field (history major). I learned a lot, but be prepared to not get a A, and to work your ass off.",1
"I took her 111 course last year. She truly knows her material and presents it well, and she wants you to know your stuff and will help you with it. But be prepared to work because you need to practice and practice and practice again.",1
He puts all the readings and films you need for the class online for you. He assigns several articles or chapters from books that he expects you to read between classes. You also had to watch the film out of class. He is a tough grader for the quizzes but is not so tough with the papers which was a boost to my grade.,1
"I took a few classes with this instructor, all online. I got to know him as he was the coordinated the program that I got my Drug & Alcohol certificate thru at CCAC. He's very helpful, doesn't belittle questions/concerns, provides a clear concise syllabus with flexibility (as long as assignments as a whole were completed by the end of semester).",1
"He lectures straight out of the book, so I wouldnt bother with the lectures. The tests are similar to the homework. He is a nice man, but frankly, his teaching is awful. He is getting paid to teach, not to be nice. Watching paint dry is more interesting.",0
Horrible experience for the online summer class. Webcam is requires for tests and is extremely uncomfortable. You have to buy and expensive online program that requires you to log on multiple times a day. Tough grader on projects. Hard tests even for a 4000 level class. Would NOT recommend at all. Dropping this course.,0
Beyond the best. He is an amazing human being as well as an amazing teacher. I honestly feel blessed to have been lucky enough to accidentally been enrolled in his class. And I am not religious at all.,1
"Professor Sbragia  lectures in a way that allows for learning to take place, but also for those listening to enjoy it. He somehow manages to make a topic as broad as ""Rome"" easier to comprehend and more structured. Great class, definitely would take again. ",1
Hated this professor,0
"The man knows everything about CAD, which is awesome.  But he likes to have you solve your own problems so if you're struggling with something he'll referr you to the text sometimes.  Good though for first year students because he takes you step by step through everything.",1
Great teacher. Elisa is nice and she cares about all of her students so much. The class was definitely easy and doesn't require a lot of time outside of the classroom. DONT buy the book. We NEVER used it. But the test were unorthodoxed and made us think critically. I love her class. Definitely a GREAT teacher.,1
"She does not use her lecture time very well. She spends a long time on a particular topic, then has to hurry and cover other material in a very short period of time. Takes points for attendance in lecture and discussion sessions once a week. Overall a nice teacher, but I felt she made an entry level Biology course incredibly too hard.",0
"Be prepared to study. She is very clear about what to expect on exams, but her exams are very difficult and if you do not put in the effort, your grade will suffer. She does give A LOT of extra credit and does curve exams, so it definitely helps. She's a very sweet woman and cares about her students. Her stories are also really funny.",1
"So Caldwell is a genius. There's no denying that. But, if you don't write in your papers exactly what he believes, you won't get an A. Also, he tends to go on these like weird tangents pretty often. Overall, he's smart, and teaches well, but not the best grader...",1
"He's such a great professor! He's incredibly knowledgeable and really makes you ponder about everything.  You start to question yourself and the life around you. The course was eye- opening and great. Classes were pretty boring and slow,and sometimes got a little repetitive. I really liked his teaching style and really emphasized individual growth.",1
He is gorgeous and caring. He is super smart and nice!!! I low key admire him��,1
"Wonderful teacher, made a tough subject easy to understand. Pay attention and you will pass. Better than other electricity teachers on campus or so I've heard. Make your life a lot easier and take this class.",1
"Jon is a great professor. I've taken several classes from him. He does expect a lot from his students (which is fair because he teaches upper division classes). He is great at responding to emails and giving good feedback. Although his class is hard, it is SO worth taking. Just be sure to get a good group. This will make your live so much easier!",1
"I really wanted to enjoy this class because of the subject, but Professor Sewell makes it hard to. I've taken more academically rigorous classes, yet this professor has the harshest standards of grading I've witnessed so far. She does give instructions, but even when you try to adhere to her standards, it's not good enough. Regret signing up.",0
"Dr. Teekell is amazing!! Hands down the best professor I've had at CNU.  She really cares about her students, and although the workload is a bit overwhelming, it really pays off and you can see the results.  I definitely saw an improvement in my work from the beginning of class to the end.",1
"Horrible attitude towards students, demeaning, and insulting. Could not wait to get out of that class.",0
"Honestly don't even know where to start with this guy. He's unorganized, rude, boring, and seems inadequate for the position. During lectures, you can't help but notice how it seems like he has not clue what he is talking about and that observation is proven when someone in the class asks him a question or to elaborate more. Stay away!",0
"Prof. Cerda is a very nice person, her class was not that much fun. However, class its kind off the lines sometimes. She expects that students read the ENTIRE BOOK. ""Mind you 15 chapters.""  Test are so,so. One group project and one individual essay. GO TO EVERY CLASS.",1
"DONT TAKE HER. VERY UNPREPARED, ALL OVER THE PLACE. DOESNT TEACH. EXPECTS YOU TO LEARN ON YOUR OWN. THIS SHOULD BE AN ONLINE CLASS. SERIOUSLY.",0
Professor Freed is easily the worst professor I've ever had. She teaches like a kindergarten teacher but grades like a grad school professor. She's useless at getting information across but she will grade your papers impossible hard. I'm an english major and I've never had a professor who grades like Freed. DO NOT TAKE HER CLASSES.,0
"I agree with the previous LAS statement. He also gets his facts wrong and is braggy sometimes about his knowledge and experience. When students don't understand him, his excuse is ""I'm speaking Spanglish"" when really he is not explaining the material clearly. While he is polite, he needs to be more respectable to his students. Avoid him for LAS!",0
awful.,0
"This professor is very informative. I took this professor for 2 classes a while back. Glad I didn't take them online. She was young, so I did no expect very much. Attorney Bouchard is very knowledgeable and kind. Attorney Bouchard's classes were fun and interesting. Liked the textbook she wrote. Grading was fair.",1
"Long boring lectures, her quizzes were straight forward, the class project was super easy BUT her midterm and final were ridiculously difficult!The Midterm was multiple choice and free response, questions were hella specific and totally unexpecting.The final was similar to the final but more straightforward. Advice:STUDY EVERYTHING!Take good notes!",0
"Nice Guy, bad jokes. Doesnt return HomeWork soon enough for students to know if they are doing their work correctly. Puts questions on quizzes from sections he hasn't gone over. He doesn't go through the process of solving problems, he just plugs it into Mathematica and students have to figure it out for themselves.",0
"Shara is a great designer and you can tell this by her passion for the craft, shes a wealth of knowledge of you know what questions to ask. Shes always open to talking and bouncing ideas off of",1
"to many writing assignments, you should be able to read up to 10 chapters a day because he makes you read like crazy and its too much stress especially if you have a job, hardly any tests in that class, its too much freaking work for a class that you'll never need in life!!!!!",0
she is really boring. but her test are really easy and the project she gives is easy. Her test are really easy if you review your nuts. Its just sitting in her class that drives you nuts. ,0
Great professor. Incredible analytical skills. Cares about her student's success.  Her expectations are clearly communicated. Her assignments are fair. Participate in the discussions in her course and do your readings you'll do great. Must admit that the readings are challenging so take notes when you're reading them.  ,1
Below average teacher,0
Doesn't allow students to ask questions. Doesn't thoroughly explain. No sympathy for students that were in the hospital or dealing with deaths making them still fully responsible to turn in homework and take exam and scheduled dates. Too much homework that doesn't contribute a great value in overall class grade. Terrible teacher. SWITCH OUT OR DROP,0
Hard Class like reallllly hard. Mrs. Sharon is a respectable teacher. yes you have to work for it but she will help you along the way. ,1
It's a shame this man is a professor for the prerequisite classes. He seems so unhappy teaching 2D and 3D which transfers into our class environment. If you are not conceptual or performative do not expect him to like your work. I see him discouraging many future artists which is very disappointing. Do not take him if you have the option.,0
Great professor if you fail its because of you,1
"Professor Biermann is a nice man, he is funny, and can go off topic on funny subjects. However his lectures do not really do anything, he relies mainly on you reading the book, if you are someone like me who learns more when the professor explains things and actually TEACHES you, then prof Biermann is not your man. Also his movie selection sucks!",0
"A great undergrad professor really only needs to do three things with each lecture or lesson: 1) Present the idea 2) Guide students along a conceptual path with lecture, examples, and worked problems for that idea, concept, technology. 3) Summarize the path and test knowledge. Jim Helm skips step 2. Lectures are just him reading slides.",0
"Father Ranieri cares for his students and is incredibly knowledgeable. He isn't the toughest grader in the world, but make sure you put meaningful though and effort into your work.",1
"Taking her now, & she's a nice professor. Lots of reading, but the readings are interesting. Quizzes are mostly opinion based so it's hard to get them wrong. Documentaries every week, so if you hate watching movies, this isn't the class for you. Discussion based class, so if you hate participating, then I wouldn't suggest Sullivan.",1
"If you're looking at taking a psych class, CHOOSE MCPHEARSON. Intro to Psych with her was honestly a breeze. There are weekly online quizzes that are based off the assigned reading from the textbook, but the quizzes are done at home. If you write notes in class and look over them before the test, it will be very easy. No essays to write.",1
"The 8wk summer virus sess. experience lacked cohesion. Often I found a disconnect between the lectures split between 2 different professors, vs. the classwork + hw. Got a standoffish vibe when contacting prof. silva for help. Canvas poorly structured, terribly organized and like some mention, there are a lot of assignments. The most I have seen.",0
Good Professor,1
"great guy, if you wanna learn the real deal take tony bass. learn the material by taking notes and reviewing them time to time and you should get an A no problem",1
"Brilliant and fun professor! Took differential equations (MATH 215 I think) and notation & proof (MATH 325) way back in 2009; as a Ph.D student today, I still remember what he taught, and how amazingly well he taught :). Don't ever miss taking class with him, you'll learn well!",1
Moore is a great professor. he knows his stuff and is hilarious. There is a bit of reading but it is manageable. The final essay is the main grade for the class but wasnt too hard.,1
The worst professor in the planet. Cold calls hates explaining himself more than once and papers and take home exams take 12+hours to complete. Calls people out.,0
Don't take her. It's hard to understand what she says during class. You mostly will have to teach yourself.,0
"The teacher is fine, the class was fine for me. There are around 4-5 papers with enough time to turn them in. there is not much to learn mostly just understanding the readings and writing.",1
"do not take this class I repeat do not take this if he is the instructor , really horrible grader , doesn't try to help, talks around the point and can never be straight forward.",0
"Prof. Lohrey was knowledgeable on the topic of accounting, but did not make it as easy when he taught. He would point out questions that would be on exams, and tell us the HW was not required to do. I still did the HW because those same questions would be on the exams. Utilize the textbook cuz he can be confusing at times. And no phones in class!",1
Great Professor with a wonderful personality.  If you ask a question about advertising you know he is well versed in the category and is more than willing to answer questions.,1
I don't even understand how she is actually employed...,0
"Avoid at all cost, probably the most frustrating educator I've ever met in my life. Constantly changing teaching plan and grading criteria. You have no idea about what you're actually doing and what to expect. Better teach yourself phonology than attending her class.",0
I figured I'd give Connor a shot since it was at a good time. I went to class the first day and I automatically knew it was awful. She was VERY unclear with her actions and it just overall confusing. I switched out after that. It just was not worth it. I'd pick another class if I were you,0
She is one of the most inappropriate and careless professors I have ever met. She is careless and doesnt care about her students. Take take her classes,0
"Professor Zank is a really passionate about religion and provides a good intro to the Bible. His lectures are random and unorganized. His exams are difficult and there is a lot of memorization. If you can take another humanities course, I would recommend it unless you are super passionate about the Bible. He spends a lot of time on topics he likes",1
"Definitely does assign A LOT of reading (20+ pages per class) however, i read maybe twice and got an A. The only major grades are the midterm, final, and research paper. She gives you a list of all the terms you have to remember as well as the possible essays and its a lot to memorize but it can be done. She offers a lot of extra credit.",0
"Professor Arnold does not try to be difficult.  She is not a difficult grader, but she is about as clear as mud when it comes to explaining her expectations of an assignment...and although I don't like to be negative, I must say she is rather unhelpful in nearly every area of the classroom.",0
"Didn't like that most of math formulas used/execution of math problems couldn't be found in textbook as the slides were from Pearson, not OpenStax (this was confusing). Sometimes impatient with evening class students. Did make effort in explaining problems mid-semester for tests and final exam. Advice, team with classmates and use youtube math.",1
"Very hard grader!! I was lucky to even get a B in his class. You get 4 essays to complete throughout the semester. He allows you to bring a rough draft and edit with your peers,which helped. Make sure you do homework and participate in class discussions. Try to go to his office hours prior to handing your essays it will help avoid falling a essay.",0
Awful class Worse class I have ever taken.  She will not review tests answer questions or give examples.  doesn't appear to value students at all When we pointed out incorrect test answers she refused to give us credit for them,0
Never seemed to respond to my emails so that was tough when an assignment was confusing. Overall the class was pretty easy but it is definitely a lot of tedious work. Same thing every week.,0
To be honest she isnt very helpful and she can be very rude she gives out too much work and she gives out too many essays and she is very specific on what you need to do would i take her class again nah,0
"She does not teach. She rambles on about irrelevant topics and really does not enjoy being there in class. She basically just wants to get through the material and receive her paycheck. If you want to learn accounting, take someone else. You are stuck fending for yourself in this class, and it is not enjoyable. Easy due to ex cred, but not helpful.",0
Her exams are tough sometimes just cause missing one question can make a big difference on a test with few questions. She's pretty clear about the criteria and she'll help if you ask her for it. Always has good life lessons ,1
He's great! Lots of homework in Math XL but clear grading criteria. He responds within 24 hours to emails and gives good feedback. He works with you to help you understand material if needed. He's overall just a really cool guy.,1
"I dropped 2 classes and almost got fired from my job to study and STILL did not pass. ENORMOUS amounts of homework! I highly recommend taking it with a different professor. I was warned before class began and I stuck with it. DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE! I hear the professor with the last name starting with a ""J"" is phenomenal! Get out NOW!",0
"This is by far the worst professor I have ever had. He does not know how to teach. He will lecture the whole class on random information and then give you a pop quiz that doesn't even have to do with anything you learned. He doesn't post any grades. When checking in with him to see what my grade was he said ""I don't know calculate it yourself.",0
"Knoop was difficult at best.  If you have a difficult time getting long with her it will be reflected in your grades.  She will even admit if she doesn't like you she's harder on you.  Following along in class is difficult, expect to run off topic at least three times a class. Her knowledge of the industry is dated at best.",0
"Dr. Hansen is a great guy, but the lectures are on the boring side. For someone not very interested in environmental science, I had a hard time paying attention during lectures. However, I know that he is great for people that have lots of questions about the topics of discussion.",1
I had Mr. Sato for English 1A and I loved him. I love english so I figured taking his class again would be a good idea. I was very wrong. He seemed to have turned on me and would constantly mark me down for ridiu=culous things. He showed favoritism to a lot of other people which is ridiculous. I would never take another one of his class again!,0
"Dr. Holtan is an engaging, fun professor who still manages to pass on relevant information. I recommend any of her classes.",1
"Even on Spring Break, Dr. Lafferty is available. She has been very friendly, clear, fair, and gives feedback and her opinion often. She incorporates her personal life regarding her education; I don't think it's too much, I think she is trying to relate to the students she can't connect with in person. No tests, 3 papers and several discussions.  ",1
"Dont listen to the negative comments. Although you do have to memorize a lot, so does everyone else in the class. He prepares us as much as he can for the final and most importantly for the bar exam. I thought his exam was straightforward if anything so long as you memorize the rules and case names. He is a little scary but overall very helpful",1
Group projects account for 40% of the total class grade. The first project takes about 2 weeks to finish and is insanely long.  This class isn't hard but has a ton of busy work.  Teacher gives very little feedback and the syllabus is confusing when describing assignments.  Teacher doesn't add to discussion posts at all.,0
If you take this course be ready to spend time on it.,1
"hard class, you need to get over her accent or you will not pass",0
"Dr. Stoner was one of the best professors I have ever had. I have had him for two undergraduate courses and two graduate courses and he served on both my undergrad thesis and masters defense committees. He genuinely cares about students learning and producing the best work they can. If you're looking for an A without trying, maybe look elsewhere.",1
Gives good lectures but very opinionated and doesn't really open her mind to student's perspectives. Memorize her opinions on topics in order to do well in the class and on the exams. She is kinda rude and detached from students. She is also a really tough grader and multiple people in my class including myself said she didn't grade fairly.,0
Mr. Lewis was a great instructor.  He made it easy to learn and was very helpful! He had little hints to help you memorize anatomy and physiology.. Make sure you study and listen to him in class and you will do well!,1
Lecture was long and tedious..........,0
The worst teacher I have ever had. I went to her on several occasions and she was rude and never helped,0
"There is without a doubt more expectations on the students in his 211 class than in other classes. He makes you think- a lot, but somehow everyone always makes it out with a good grade. The more involved the class is in discussion, the easier and more enjoyable the class is. It's NOT difficult as long as you put forth some effort. ",0
Danny is a great teacher.  He makes everyone feel very comfortable and class is fun.  He is very knowledgeable and he is easy to talk to.  He gets annoyed when people are not prepared or when you talk when he's talking or while people are performing scenes so don't do that.,1
Dr. Vanderzalm was a great Prof who loves answering questions and was able to explain the material throughly but only gave you the information you needed to know which was great. She gives study guides before exams. Exams were very similar to the study guidies. If you know the study guides inside out you'll get an A on every exam!,1
"Dr. Santos is amazing, period. She is incredibly respected throughout the English Department by faculty and students alike. She's really a gem and I wish I could take more courses with her. She's brilliant, nice, caring, and a feminist. Does it get better than that?",1
"This class is scary at the beginning. Very front loaded type class. She makes it fun with stories and songs but you MUST learn the phonetics, which didn't come easy to me. Things get easier, and she is willing to help you out. Her voice is wonderful and listening to her helped my comprehension a lot.",1
"In 4 years of undergrad and 2 years of grad school this was the worst class and worst professor I ever had. There is a text book, but he literally only uses the inside covers. Dropped the class, but it was mandatory and he was the only one to teach it.",0
"Professor Bronie really cares about her students excelling in mathematics Shes very charismatic about the subject. Be prepared to memorize the methods that she requires for solving certain equations, lots of homework and tough grading. Overall, shes a great teacher that pushes her students.",1
A great and fun class really helps her students get over their fear of public speaking tests are easy doesnt have time limits on speach only upto 5 minutes would take her class again.,1
"The best choice for EE205. He is excellent at explaining difficult subjects and concepts, his exams are very fair, straightforward, and similar to the review packet he gives out. He readily accommodates student's needs, and doesn't really give that much homework. He is also very available outside of class and happy to help and answer questions.",1
"By far the worst professor that I have ever had. She never responds to emails, but those rare times that she does, she wont even answer your questions. Shes never taught .. just gives the work. She makes it hard to learn, and wont help even if you're begging for help. You're really on your own. DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS. YOU'LL BE SET UP FOR FAILURE!",0
Spencer has structured this class such that your grade depends on you knowledge of Accounting Vocabulary more than your actual knowledge of accounting.  So read the vocabulary sections and you should be ok...don't really expect to learn very much accounting though...,0
Wouldnt have passed w/o my smart boyfriend. Lectures are just him making something complicated when it is simple & he only lectured once or twice a week. I hardly attended class. Only days of quizzes/exams. Gives many assignments that are tedious & not helpful. You are better off getting tutored at the learning center than going to his class.,0
"He makes you read novels that have nothing to do with sociology. Class was basically created so he could tell you about his life. Hated every minute of this class. I could write an bio about this man and probably get 99% of it right. Avoid taking Maril if you can. If can't avoid, expect a B or lower. He thinks an A+ or A is perfect so wont give out",0
Best history prof. at the U. He seems easy at first but he will challenge to do better. Wish I could pull off the way he mixes his patterns on his clothes!!!!,1
Dr. Dorsett is an extremely funny person and her class is never boring! Her work is no where near easy so you really have to study and pay attention but overall I enjoyed her and her class!,1
"Let me keep this short and simple, if you can watch C-span for 2+ hours then take his class, if not then stay away, I beg of you please,please,please dont take his class. You wont believe how insanely boring he is. Not Worth it, plus there was a number of times he assigned the dumbest assignments.",0
"I loved Crawley both times I had him, for physiological psych and for psychological apps of stats. Tests are tough and there was a quiz every class for physio, but that was only to help us stay on track and ensure we were reading our books. You can tell he knows what he's doing and he loves it. He's always gone out of his way to help when needed!",1
"This professor is one of the worst I've ever had. Very little in class instruction, we were expected to teach ourselves while she sat back and recovered from her illness. So many assignments and so little time to do them. No instruction either, she expects great work and expects everyone knows how to do what she is teaching already.",0
Most stressful course ever.,0
"Hands down Madame Pillai is one of my favorite professors. This class definitely requires class participation. She makes you work for an A as a great prof should. She is extremely passionate about teaching. She is very approachable and you can see how passionate she is for teaching. Just come prepared, because that's all she asks. It's that simple!",1
"Nice enough lady, but it's useless disagreeing with her. Super easy class if you've taken management principles or marketing, or psych,. All the same stuff.  Class is a waste of time. She's helpful if you need it, but her lectures are basically her reading the powerpoint. Just read the bold stuff in  the textbook and you'll be fine.",0
"Worst professor I have ever had. Notes are not easy to follow, her lecture style is terrible, she can't stand when students ask questions about the extremely dense material, all tests are fill in. The text book was easier to follow than her notes, she is terrible at answering emails and grades extremely harshly. Coming from a straight A student.",0
Professor Beck was an incredibly kind and genuine professor. She is caring and extremely accommodating. I think her class is an easy A if you put in the work. I would recommend going to her lectures and taking notes on what she says and really paying attention. The content is actually pretty interesting as well. Would recommend this class for GenEd,1
"best teacher ever. I had never liked anything related to science until i met this teacher. the class is easy, the exams are easy just need to study the material from class. i would recommend this teacher.",1
"Best math professor ever. Cared more about some of the students grades than they themselves did. Committed to your success. Lectures are crystal clear, I now have a new passion for math. Most importantly, I learned a lot and felt challenged to do better. Definitely taking her in the future.",1
"This class is SUPER hard. No exaggeration. He has a really thick accent so you'll never know what he's saying.  He writes TONS of notes and does not explain them unless you ask him to, even when you ask, you still won't get it. Also, he has terrible handwriting, so copying notes is even a struggle. Steer clear of this professor, please!",0
"Her online lab class has 18 weekly modules, lots of lab assignments, extra credit discussions, midterm, final, & weekly mandatory zoom classes. Ask questions & participate, she is super responsive and accommodative! She truly cares about her students and loves her profession! A bit of a tedious class but she is one of the best lab professors ever!!",1
"is a very hard grader and gives a lot of homework. The homework is always the hardest possible questions from the book and the tests are the same way. I had taken this class before from another school so I already knew the material, but he made this class 1000 times harder than it needed to be.",0
Would not recommend this teacher to non english majors. He knows a lot and wants us to know a lot but most of the time it has nothing to do with the assigned text. He's funny and extremely experienced. Lets you rewrite essays for a better grade. His lectures can be tortuously long if you're not interested in English or history.,0
"Like Professor Ryan, except the other way around, and not interesting.",0
She is an amazing teacher that will help you. She is the best at memory tricks and explaining things well. There are weekly quizzes but when it comes time for the final it's worth it! If she had any other classes I would take them in a heartbeat. ,1
"Takes points off for the wrong hue of yellow. If creative choices do not align with her own, points are lost. Spent most of class on non-class topics. Breaks lasted upwards of 45 min., covering new topics with 5 min. left of class, running over. Welcomed outside students into her class to interrupt lectures. Take with someone else.",0
He is such a great teacher! He doesnt sit up their and bore you with a lecture. He actually teaches so it is understandable. He also does so many examples to make sure students understand.,1
"Professor GZ is wonderful, her in-class explanations of Calc 2 topics are very relevant and down-to-earth. She has incredible patience for simple questions, and is persistent in working through student struggles.",1
"She is strict when it comes to grading. Syllabus was confusing, had to buy a whole textbook for an online code. Didnt use the physical textbook at all. Didnt really like the online program, either.",1
"Professor Boris seems like he is passionate and knowledgable about Philosophy, but I did find it hard to grasp what he was trying to come across most of the time. I also couldn't focus too much because I was constantly writing notes and trying to transcribe all the ideas he would constantly throw around.",0
"Xing is hard to understand (accent), but she is a great prof. She wants to see thought process, not just relaying information. She also enjoys talking outside of class. This was an experimental class from my understanding, and some information was repetitive, but I did not feel stressed. Her grading is a tad harsh on essays I find, but not too bad.",1
"Would never EVER take this class again, neither should you. Three classes left with ONE grade entered plus attendance. Talks about personal problems frequently with the excuse for not having papers graded to be ""there was too much negativity reading those."" Honestly just can't believe how terrible this class has been.",0
"Let me just say, she is a nice lady, but she expects you to know every single thing, when all she does is give lectures throughout labs, when it's only supposed to be during lecture. I'm glad I withdrew, because I would probably have failed, from out of the ordinary things, such as her accent, her unorganization, and her way of teaching in general.",0
Honestly she is the best professor of all,1
"If online, skip her. She's terrible. Uploads videos of lectures where she just reads off the PowerPoint without explaining things properly. She rushes through everything. You seriously won't learn anything from her. Not hard to pass but she's a terrible online instructor. She offers extra credit which helps your grade but I wanted to learn...",0
"Students should only take this course if they are serious about working in the medical field. Dr. S provided weekend classes to further explain the material.  Read the book, his PowerPoints, watch CrashCourse on YouTube, take advantage of LearnSmart features.  You will study your ass off but you will KNOW the material very well and feel prepared",1
Completely useless. Never had a worse experience in the classroom. I have learned nothing because he has taught nothing. Talks about irrelevant things and makes us watch movies that have nothing to do with the material. His tests are a joke. He has not once come to class on time and when he is in the classroom he waists my time by being there.,0
Good professor. Helpful where it counts.,1
"Todd is a great professor but since he is so confident in the material he's teaching sometimes it's discouraging to sit through lectures when you don't understand the material yourself.  Three exams, four assignments and a 5 page paper - overall, would recommend taking this class with him.",1
"This is one of those professors that says there's a ""method to their madness"" because they know they're too disorganized to teach properly",0
"Great person, great interpreter, great teacher... when he actually teaches. Which is approximately 0.5% of each class. He's a total rambler (mostly just talks about himself and his life stories). Class feels like a waste of time the other 95.5% of the time. He's a PAINFULLY slow grader. Would be a good interpreting ally, but not fit for a teacher.",1
This class really helped improve my coding design thinking. Challenging but you will truly learn a lot as long as you stay engaged! He's a fair grader -- he does reiterate what he looks for on exams and homework; you just need to keep your ears open and take note of them. Assignments are interesting/fun! Super helpful during OH. Would take again.,1
"(This course was taken during COVID, so take this with a grain of salt) Falk is a nice, kind man, but he is the worst professor I've ever had in my life and I no longer want to pursue a math minor because of him. I feel like I am paying thousands of dollars to teach myself the content on YouTube because he never provides solid, concrete examples.",0
"This class was horrible, and this teacher was HORRIBLE. She isn't helpful or clear at all, and makes no attempt to respond or help out when a student is in need. Her grading criteria is weird and stupid. The material is USELESS. There's no reason an Intro to Research class should be harder than an Advanced Research Writing class. She is just awful.",0
"She rarely explains anything in class. She has NO rubrics. She gets off topic every single class period, nothing relates to the actual topic. Isn't the best communicator, never uses her email or Plato. If I were you, I would NOT declare as a health science major or you'll be dealing with her all 4 years. I wouldn't take any classes with her.",0
His cass is the only of the four I amtaking that makes no sence. I could learn more just reading th book and not coming to class. He starts class early and ends late. So do not take any classes just before or after his class.,0
"Mr. Bannow is clearly very intelligent. He expects everyone to try their hardest in his class. The syllabus he provides at the beginning of the semester can be followed exactly, so you know when every test, quiz, and homework assignment is due. If you go to class, read the text, and do the homework assignments then you will do great.",1
"One of the worst professors I have had at ASU. The class isn't too hard and you can easily get a C, but he does not teach well at all. He goes through slides the whole class and assigns homework that we never learned about. Group presentations were given no rubric, and docks you for things you didn't even know he was grading you on.",0
"He moves too fast in lecture. When he ""works out"" problems in class he just puts a previously worked out problem on the projector and has a contest with himself to see how fast he can go through it. ",0
"I Love this class,I recommend taking it! You have 2papers,a midterm and a project/paper as a final. just do the readings and pay attention in class and the her examples.",1
"This course was disorganized which added to the difficultly. Recorded lectures were posted late and assignments+essays took a long time to be graded. This course was so much work, and was not that rewarding. There was 10 group assignments in the semester which was difficult, especially being online. MIDTERM ESSAYS WERE GRADED BY STUDENTS?!",0
"This professor was not great. She does not give good feedback, and when she does give feedback, it is vague (""Maybe you should work on this some more."") Also, she wastes a lot of class time. It takes her about 30 minutes just to get through the announcements, which should take about 5. Her lectures are redundant, but the information is useless.",0
Avoid at all costs. He pretends to want to help you and then destroys all your ideas because he doesn't understand them. Lectures are extremely boring and participation is worth 15%,0
"Professor Miller leads amazing discussions and has a profound passion for her work. She comes to class prepared and leads discussions that are engaging and interesting. Extremely available out of class, and extremely approachable. She is a hard grader but her class is extremely enjoyable and you learn a lot. One of the best classes I have taken.",1
"Not only a tough grader but an unfair grader. DO NOT RECOMMEND WHATSOEVER.  Also she is not afraid to share her views with the class, which I found unprofessional. Definitely an interesting class but it is not enjoyable whatsoever. She does give extra credit options but even is picky with that. DO NOT RECOMMEND.  Not a nice nor understanding prof.",0
"Professor Smith's lectures were enjoyable, and his jokes were funny because they were intentionally bad. He has a dry, sometimes sick sense of humor, and he is very passionate and excited about what he teaches, which really helped me learn as well. Enjoyable, and educational too. I highly recommend taking a class from him if you get the chance.",1
best teacher at st.joes she is very helpful and understanding. i took her for 3 years straight because shes a great teacher,1
"If you are considering taking her class online, dont. Completely unorganized, changes deadlines on assignments and tests all the time. Unclear instructions about everything. She takes a whole month to reply to your email, or doesnt email you back at all. The semester ends this week, and barely any grades are in. Just avoid this class if you can.",0
"I thought this class was difficult when we were actually going to school but this is the worst class I could have taken during this pandemic. She leaves TONS of work like we don't have other classes to deal with on top of stressing. Those memes about professors leaving 20 assignments and telling you ""I know it's a stressful time but.."" are her.",1
"Frequently late to class, rarely responds to emails, tests you over things that aren't covered but doesn't use the book. She requires you to purchase the book even though it's on canvas... We're very behind and continuously get farther behind because she goes off on tangents about her kid or husband. DO NOT take",0
"Zhao was a great professor. His class was only offered at 8am and that scared me, but he made me want to go to class. He reinforced my love for chemistry and although he has an accent, he was very easy to understand. He gives all of the information needed to do well in the class. He also gives major extra credit points. Also pretty attractive.",1
"Why would the school let this teacher teach ""Counseling"" classes. She discourages students and probably is the reason for many drop outs. She is a complete power hungry B!%@# and I really hope she gets it handed to her when she finally snaps and hits a student",0
"Professor Ratner's class is beyond dull. He stands in front of the class and reads off the slides the entire lecture. 3 exams and 1 project. No room for error. His ""curves"" are points reimbursed for mistakes that he made on the exam. He's also pretty inconsiderate, he doesn't care about your situation unless you provide hard proof. Dont recommend.",0
"Awful PHD instructor. This class is all about organization and the most unorganized class I've ever taken. Funny how that works, right? Her assignments make absolutely no sense and when you ask for clarification she sighs and rolls her eyes. On top of that, she deducts points for going above and beyond and takes months to grade assignments.",0
Ms. Feagin knows a lot about American history but I feel that she tries to cram too many activities into one semester.,0
I took the class online but it is no longer offered. Any time i had issues i could contact  her via text bu t that was pretty much the only way. I had to get help from the mathlab because my teacher didn't have an office. She gave me an A (94-100) even though the pearson weighted grade was 92.7.,1
Dr. Gelderloos is a thoughtful professor who truly loves the material he teaches. He is not very easy but not hard; he moves through a lot of material quickly. Going to class and keeping up with the readings will guarantee you a good grade.,1
"He is not that bad, those who wrote below are probably used to professors spoon feeding them info like most other professors...Weiner is a nice man and he is very helpful when help is asked for..his syllabus is clear from day one, and he's no nonesense. The work load is low and the book is an easy read..take this guy if you want to learn something",1
"took for texts&contexts-not the easiest grader, but not the hardest.he's probably a secret genius.he knew everything about everything. kind of scatter-brained though and often went off on tangents-especially about birds.he's a nice guy though.if you're willing to put in some effort a B+ is definitely attainable.not sure what he expects for an A tho",0
Very structured an organized class. Great teacher. Straight forward with what she expects from you. As long as you complete the work and put in effort this can be an easy A. Took this class as a summer course- was a bit tiering having to write a paper every day but it was manageable.,1
"She seems like a nice lady, but her teaching method is very different. If you cant handle very fast lectures, I wouldnt recommend taking her. Only give 3 test the whole semester with opportunity for extra credit but test are very different than how she teaches. Test are lots of word problems but in class she doesnt teach you that way.",0
Bases his lectures on questions and when you ask a question he makes you feel dumb that you don't know the answer. Never really fully answers question. Smart guy just doesn't know how to communicate the subject to his students.,0
"She's pretty disorganized and not super interesting, but her class is easy to pass. The exams are way more involved (and graded harder) than you'd think, given how easy the day-to-day work is, so study hard for the midterm and final. Overall, don't love, but it's still a pretty easy class.",0
i loved his class! he is really interesting and the class isn't too hard as long as you do the work and go to class. (and he is pretty cute too),1
Take Voice and Movement !!! It's sweeter than HONEYYYY ����,1
"all of the questions on the exams are trick questions and are extremely hard even if you study and think you know the material, you'll get to the exam and be confused probably.  don't ask questions unless you're prepared to get roasted by him.",0
"Pretty mundane lecturer. Tests were basically the lectures and were pretty hard. No extra credit given. Speeches and papers were graded extremely hard and only looked for ""key phrases"" instead of actual content or delivery. Grades largely depend on TA. Do not take Marguerite Liechenstein as your TA, unfair grader. Don't buy the book, waste of money",0
"Don't even think about taking him for Differential Equations. The first day when he said this is the first time teaching this class in 20 years I should have dropped it. Not prepaired, completely oblivious his surroundings, doesn't know what he is doing half the time, and just a bad teacher in general. Don't make the same mistake I did...",0
"The class is disorganized, assignments changed at the last minute.  Lectures aren't mandatory, but they are minimal at best.  Expect to write at least 6 papers, no tests.      If you expect an organized class that follows the syllabus this class isn't for you.  I would not recommend this class.",0
"The reading material this professor requires is outrageous. There was no textbook for my course by he posted 10 or more articles a day that he expected the students to read. Some articles were as little as 5-10 pages but many were 20 pages+. If you have the option to take another professor, I encourage it!",1
"A tough class, but a great teacher. Definitely a satisfying challenge.",1
"She is the worst professor I have ever had. An absolute joke. Shes often off topic, goes on long rants, is very pretentious and condescending. I truly would transfer universities before taking her again.",0
"Among the worst professors I've ever had. She projects blame onto students for her own lack of knowledge, ridiculously vague and contradictory requirements, and even her inability to use basic teaching technology like Carmen or MS Word. When you point out her contradictory requirements or mistakes she makes, she comes down hard on you. Rude. Awful.",0
"Very knowledgeable and has a lot of real life experiences.  As previously mentioned, he is an easy grader and the class can be somewhat boring.  Definitely take him if you want to learn some things.",1
"Dr. Richards is very intelligent but extremely rude. Do not bother answering a question in class unless you know it is 100% correct, or she will embarrass and belittle you in front of the class.",1
"Really good class discussion, interesting scenarios",1
"This teacher is a great person, but not a great teacher. She did not teach this whole semester. All she ever talked about was her kids and her life. She only taught a lecture three times  the whole semester, and still expected you take quizzes over material each week. Get the book, its the only way you will pass.",0
"Overall a pretty good guy. Not always the most interesting lectures, but I didnt enjoy this class. Do your readings, study and get involved and this class is a piece of cake.",1
"the teacher has a heavy accent and bumble a lot. The only way that i pass that class was because i had already took calc on high school. I try to understand the way that he teach but i end up getting more confuse. If you choose to have this profesor, you will have to use the book for further understanding of the content. The test are really short",0
"Pass on this Professor. Doesn't teach, is rude at times and expects the most from students. Heavily graded on discussion boards and participation.",0
"Don't be scared to take her class, she really encourages the students to ask questions and if you study her powerpoints you should do really good on the exams. She is picky about spelling, so be careful with that. There are bonus questions on every exam :)) overall the class is very interesting!",1
Wolfe's class made an impact to my life and motivation. Never have I ever met people this nice and amazing.,1
"I can't with these people complaining about her. Mrs. Trombley is one of the best teachers in LAVC. She is accessible anytime you need, she's helpful if you have questions. And her classes are very informative. It might seem easy because it's online class, but actually you have to work hard to keep up with the schedule. I might take P66 with her...",1
"Dr. Shkiler was overall a fine professor. She could come off a little rude every now and then, but nothing crazy.",1
"The guy is a total scatterbrain, he lost several of my assignments.  He mostly follows directly from the readings but the prompts for the papers are often vague, confusing, or just poorly written/worded.  Overall, he has a very dry and far from engaging speaking style.  I would NOT recommend taking this class with this guy.",0
"A great professor to take for this course. He lays out everything you need to do to prepare for the exams. Does a great job presenting powerpoint notes. HW can be tricky, but he's always more than willing to explain in detail if you ask for help. Exams are right out of the HW and notes. If you study those, you'll do great.",1
"Definitely recommend Dudrick if you're at all interested in Philosophy. You will need the text, but not everybody does the readings every night because he teaches everything in class. Class notes are very important so make sure to get them from a classmate if you miss class.",1
She tries to be caring and upfront but her teaching style is not the best. I've learned more from google and youtube videos than from her own lecture videos/discussions. She may make students feel as if they are not trying hard enough even when they may be putting all their time and effort into her class. Quizzes/exams for lab are never returned.,0
"So Luttrell is a nice old man. He has become the butt of most of our jokes though. He would be great teaching toxicology I'm sure, but O Chem is definitely not his strong suit. However, he is the only O Chem professor at OC. Just READ the book, get labs and homework done (easy grades), and good luck learning.",0
"Very multiple choice test heavy, which can be a good thing. Lectures are amazing.",1
"Students in the class get bored easily. She just talks and talks with no attempt to connect with the students. There is no real connection because Moore, herself, is not passionate about teaching, at least that is how it appears.",0
"Excellent teacher, makes you work so much in the whole semester until the very end. ",1
Went over many techniques for photoshop. He lets you record. Gives plenty of lab time. If you missed something he will definitely help you and repeat himself. Super nice.,1
Easy grader and easy to work with. Takes a long time to respond to e-mails.,1
"She messes up during lectures every 5 minutes which leaves you very confused, she flies through material without even explaining, just writes it down and expects you to understand. She NEVER responds to emails and she takes WEEKS to put grades in. I would avoid this professor at all costs.",0
One of the best professors I have ever had! She is super nice and loves photography. If you need to take an art class I highly recommend her!,1
"Shes a very nice lady, but this class was a waste of time. It was like she wanted to teach a race and gender studies class, but got stuck with writing and rhetoric so she had to shoehorn it into Computers and Writing. This course did not improve my writing, lecture mostly consisted of discussing pop culture, and the final was a group project.",0
"He seems kind of funny when he makes jokes in class, but he's terrifying. He calls on you in class so pray he doesn't know your name. He doesn't give clear information about what is going to be on tests/quizzes. He expects you to know the lab manual by heart and doesn't go over the theory in them. He will grill you during lab presentations. BEWARE!",0
"She is a great teacher. If I had her for an algebra teacher in high school I believe I wouldn't have to take developmental math classes in college. She is patient, she gives great examples. She understands that everyone is not a mathematician. I recommend her class for everyone.",1
Excellent Teacher,1
"Appears unapproachable but he's an easy person to talk to. If you need any help, ask him questions and he'll help you.",1
"Rivas allows students to teach themselves, and the lectures were almost solely driven by the class. There's a TON of reading, and what little writing needs done is easy. Since Rivas doesn't direct the class, walking into his final is a bit of a nightmare: it covers the entire semester's reading and requires you to think like someone with a PhD.",0
Cage is a disorganized teacher. I'll give him a little credit because he was switched to the class last minute. He loves to pick on people. He assigned a project and changed the rubric multiple times. Pop quizzes are all over the place pertaining to information learned in the beginning of the semester and he won't give you any idea what's on them.,0
This class is by far my favorite that I've taken so far. Each class was a new experience and discussions were always interesting. Garneau also has lots of real world experience with the topic. The class isn't too hard as long as you do the readings and are ready to talk about them. There aren't any tests and the other assignments are easy or fun.,1
"Homework is an easy A bc you can find quizlets for them. The exams were harder than expected but if you study hard, you'll be fine. Her exam reviews really helped. Second lab exam was a little harder than the first but still okay. The lab quizzes and unknown project were easy and make sure to do her study guides because they help. No textbook use.",1
Is awful with technology especially computers! He tells you what will be on the exams but is not really on them. And DO NOT EMAIL HIM! he is a nice guy but shouldn't be able to handle a classroom and make sure he gives you the right office hours,0
"She knows a lot about this topic. I advise everyone to take this class due to the algorithms taught are real life stuff. Start coding early and ask her for explanations. She cannot write code well. It reminds me of a CS102 student. Besides that, cool class.",1
"Pire proff que j'ai eu a l'université!!!! Si tu vas au cour ta un point de participation par cour (10 %) il explique vraiment mal. Melange les conceptsn, ne repond pas bien au question, parle toujours de son facebook pis d'écologie (voiture hybride)... Avec ce prof c'est comme si vous suivez un cour a distance!!!!!",0
Taking this class online you can thank my sttlab for anything you learn the prof is NO HELP. The tests are difficlt and lng and STATDISK wld be grt tool if you can fig out on your own how to apply it to the ?s. But whn you ask the prof he doesn't even offer any assistance. And w/no tutoring in Tampa and limitd avail for online tutoring= no bueno.,0
"DONT TAKE HER CLASS! You'll never get full credit. Nothing meets her ""standards"" even if you've followed all instructions to the T. She's one of those profs who like to take points off for nothing, but when asked she'll have no negative things to say. Very frustrating! Put in SO much effort, only getting a B. I feel I deserve 5 A's at this point.",0
Im not one to come on here and give reviews but this class was an exception. Mccroskey is not clear with her instructions on her final paper and her tests are ridiculous. Our exam grade average is horrible and it seemed near impossible to do well on her tests. Im not a fan of the way she teaches and all she ever does is show 40 slides each class.,0
"Before I took this class with Katherine Bell one of my class mates told me that he doesn't recommend her as a Biology teacher - I agree with him for 10000000000% right now! This professor is super rude. In fact, the rudest professor I've ever met in my life so far!",0
"Everything is confusing for me (can't speak for everyone else). Even when I'd get help, it just always seems like she doesn't really want to help because ""we should know this already"". Math used to be my favorite subject and now, I hate it.",0
"Great teacher, as long as you have the notes and study for the tests you'll do great. And the paper topics aren't difficult either.",1
"Professor Harvey was amazing. Due to the pandemic during the semester, we had to switch to the online class (both lab and lecture), but she tried to make everything easier for us (recording lectures, great workshops, and etc).she is very kind and caring. chem 102 is not an easy class, get ready to study, but Dr. Harvey helps you a lot. Good Luck!",1
Thank you for all you taught me. I have learned a lot this year.,1
"Marks is a good, knowledgeable prof. He let me off the hook once with a late paper when I screwed up and printed the wrong copy. Don't take this class if you struggle with Spanish, though--he's a little condescending when you ask questions and makes you feel like an idiot. But if you know your stuff, you'll get an A in here. It's grammar review.",1
"I took Kelson for A&P 1 and he is now my favorite professor at STCC. Hes very passionate about A&P and always ready to answer questions. The class was a lot of work, so if youre not ready to put the effort in do not take it. I personally loved the course, labs were really interesting. Tests were very challenging, but Kelson prepares you for them.",1
Great professor! Loves chemistry and is very helpful. She also has a good sense of humor. I definitely recommend going to class because chemistry can be a very hard subject.,1
"Martin was good, funny, interesting prof. He didn't use slides, so attendance is mandatory, but he often let us go earlier. He gave one pretty weird and silly assignment about zombies, and 3 tests, plus final. Tests were hard but short. You have to study very good and write down all what he tells in class. Get ready for surprise questions. ",1
"This instructor is knowledgeable about the subject area, but he is very arrogant and talks down to students.  Therefore, because of his behavior, a student may feel belittled.  I would rate him an A for knowledge, an a F for his attitude toward students.",1
Tests are so hard. Take elsewhere!!,0
Fun teacher....gives good examples and is very clear. Youd ont need to come to class but it definatly helps. His tests are really hard.  Its not a blow off class for sure!,1
Professor Wenstrom is the best math teach I've ever had. Her energetic and happy personality makes this class so much fun! If anybody has a question or an issue she is always there to help them. I highly recommend her!,1
She's a kook.,0
"He made it very clear at the beginning of the semester that he didn't care about any of the students. When a student had a question instead of answering it for us, he made another student answer it, down-grading the student who asked the question. He gave no homework, so i hope you're a fantastic test taker :) if you have an option pick a dif prf.",0
"His class is not for ""average"" CS students. To pass his class you either have to work hard or have access to hw/test ahead of time. Unless you understand every hw like the back of your head, you are likely to get a 0/50 on his tests. His hws are long, tricky and borderline un-doable without google. If you're forced to take him, Good Luck!",0
"Mr. Wilson was cool. Only problem that I truly had was his lack of grading throughout the course. Since the class is based on writing, you don't really know what your grade is until the end of the semester. Fortunately, I received a B in the class, but was aiming for an A. If grades matter to you, do not take him. If not, go for it. Good luck!",0
"A professor I can honestly say (without feeling cheesy) I am proud to be a student of. His oratory style tends to be sarcastic, but that's what makes his lectures great! After one class, you'll realize what a master he is at his craft(: Pay attention in lecture! I am a sophomore and I am so glad Professor Willoughby taught my first upper div class!",1
"She's very hard, but she does have a heart if you talk to her she will bend over backwards to help you. I wish she lectured using words we could understand. It sounded more foreign than the book... especially because I haven't taken a college bio before. I felt like I didn't learn anything because of that. Tests are hard too.",1
"He is a great guy and has a great personality. He jokes with the class, but he had quizzes every class period that were impossible to study for. I put in 5 hours a week for this lab but it was useless. He has things weighted to where no one can get an A. Everyone in my class got a B or lower. I never got below an A in science classes until now.",1
LOVE PROF and would definitely take him again. Text book and attendance is required. Hes so witty and funny and I wish I had class with him in person. A lot of quick writes so if you cant write an essay in about an hour or if you dont like writing dont take this class. A lot of groups projects and all the questions in quizzes are from the class,1
Terrible person. lot's of HW. Does not explain the materials.,0
Professor Susan is responsible and the best instructor ever. Her lectures are amazing. I learned a lot from her in every aspect. Take Care!,1
"She loves what she does and it shows. Her classes are interesting, direct, and meaningful. Definitely my favorite professor at Loyola and highly recommend her.",1
"I took his hybrid class and did pretty well. When I didn't understand something, he was very helpful and took time to explain it better. You can do well in his class as long as you do all of the labs. There were many tests, but no other assignments. I would recommend him.",1
Jane's great. She really loves what she teaches. Lectures are almost exactly like reading the chapter so you could either go to class or read. Her review sessions are very helpful.,1
This class consist of a lot of papers but Prof. Dendy makes up for it. She is awesome and super funny! I definitely recommend this class to any first semester student. She helps you if you have any outside problems or are having an struggles at all. She's the best!,1
"Least helpful professor i have ever had to deal with. Serious manner issues. Dont bother showing up 5 min late, he locks the door. Whole class is scared to ask/answer a question, because he will ridicule you if not up to his standards. Does not give fair warnings about tests, never reviews for tests.",0
Nicest. Prof. Ever.,1
Fun class discussions and loved the communications and team building activity class. Hope the business ethics class is this fun next semester.,1
Worst professor I ever took this semester I'm failing her course at the moment and I don't know if I could still pass! Very disorganized and difficult to pass I will never take her again!!,0
"Excellent Professor. She is clear with her expectations for you, holds you to high standards, and treats you with respect. She gives you more than enough opportunities to do well and makes what she wants you to know obvious. If you do poorly in this class it's because you didn't pay attention. She is kind, helpful, and makes you think.",1
"As a person, she is very kind. She's probably a great PT. However, as a professor, I didn't find her lectures helpful (basic overview of anatomy class) and her online materials were not up to date. She used to boast about professionalism and she had moments were she didn't display that quality. The textbook helped and the notes from her PowerPoint.",0
His explanations are good and easy to understand. Show up and pass. Simple.,1
Good prof and very care about students. She could explain the question very clear but her test was very hard. Her few extra credit can not change the grade and some questions of the test are you never seen before.,0
"She is horrible. 90% of the classes are spent in unrelated discussions. She waits until the last minute of class to tell us important info, so we end up staying late. She tells you to learn about how to write your paper by reading about it. She is extremely difficult about grammar. She marks off for every tiny thing she can find wrong.",0
"Beware taking this professor. Clearly very smart, but is often slow to get to the point, if at all. You are completely left in the dark about the grading scale and your current grade until after finals, which just compounds stress. He has a nice curve and generous scale to make up for the incomplete teaching, but would not take again.",0
I took this class in the summer.  It was very difficult.  I am excellent in mathematics and got a C.  She let us go 30 minuets before class was scheduled to go every day. She only taught us the basic applications of geometry and didn't dig deeper into the subject unless we asked her at the start of class.  She mad the homework very hard to do.,0
"I took this class thinking she would be an easy grader but she isn't. You definitely have to work for it because she is very picky with a lot of things. Overall, a very helpful course especially if you are into research and stuff.",1
"You have no idea what your grade is the entire semester. The class is pretty fast paced and gets a little bit difficult.    Dr. Matera is extremely nice, but make sure you attend class everyday! There are pop quizzes.",1
"To get an A in her class you would have to work very very hard. She gives out a lot of work. Expect homework on the first day of class till the very last day. It might start out slow, but wait till the end, she throws all these work at you. If you are not willing to put 100% effort in her class, don't take her!",0
I have Holliway for Sociology although he teaches anthropology and psych. He is a super easy going great guy who brings great topics to the class and makes it interesting. I plan on taking his psychology class. participation will get you a long way with him. not much homework or tests.,1
"Jeff is great.  He knows the stuff. He does teach many classes, which sometimes i think is too much. There isnt a lot of time to meet with him outside of class. He does go very fast, but you need to take responsibility and study for this class. Its hard, yes, but if you do the work you will do well. He is a great teacher.",1
THEE ABSOLUTE WORST TEACHER ALIVE. NEVER TAKE HIM. WAY TOO QUICK. DID NOT LEARN ONE SINGLE THING FROM HIM.,0
"I disagree with anyone recommending tonks, ok maybe compared to other professors he is ok, but seriously this class is brutal",0
"Took McDevitt for BSC1010. He is a great guy very funny and easy going. There were 5 tests, he drops the lowest one. The tests are impossibly hard, I studied 7 hours for one and still got a C. The lectures are very confusing and he made the class a little too difficult. Would not take if you're looking to get an A",0
"This professor was ok. He was extremely boring. He's a nice guy and all but I honestly would never take him again. I became miserable and ended up hating the class because the only thing he ever did was talk. He makes you sign up and pay for ""subscriptions"" just for attendance. He starts off the course easy. Gives WAY too much homework.",0
"Too much reading, I do not learn my reading 30 pages of information and then taking 4 different tests on it. I will NEVER take this class again. I just had a mental breakdown over this class and I'm over it.",0
"While Al is not the most interesting to listen to and every class is a lecture, its still a good class & hes a good prof. Hell respond to emails quickly and always explains his expectations very well. Take his classes. Study your notes for the tests/quizzes. Al is funny guy.",1
"Although Professor Gill is very nice and approachable, I didn't really enjoy having her as a prof. She can be hard to understand at times and she puts paragraphs on her slides and reads directly off of them. She makes pretty easily.",0
"Very nice teacher. Comprehensive lectures, a lot of material but we got thru it in class. Go to class. Textbook usage is up to you, but is helpful. She is an awesome professor:]",1
"One of the best professors hands down, makes the class super clear and her enthusiasm she brings to class makes class enjoyable. Take her if you get the chance!",1
Had him for summer ochem 1 and was blown away. Unlike every other stem professor Ive had he actually cares more about teaching students than his own research and is willing to go above and beyond to make sure you comprehend everything. Definitely take his class if you have the option,1
"Dr. Lamkin is super hard. She jumps from first slide to random slides while explaining. Don't take anatomy with 3-4 classes. Requires a lot of reading, understanding and the most important memorizing. If you want an A you should like put A LOT of time studying. Definitely not an easy A. Her labs are extremely hard like her lectures! No extra points",0
"Took his online PS1 course, was really solid. We had roughly 2 max, one hour long lectures a week, 4 quizzes over semester (v easy if you watched), response paper (just summarize), and three exams. I really found him to be a good professor and I actually learned a lot about gov and PS from him.",1
If you have to take IME 103. You need to get Professor Collins!!,1
He is a terrible teacher. He cops attitudes when you ask a question and reads from a projector the whole time. when you are still confused off his wrong answer all he can assume is you didnt read. Young and fresh out of college not ready to be a professor!,0
"Great guy. Do your homework for credit, you get an extra credit assignment worth 10 points for your final, then two midterms and a final. He is very straightforward and makes things easy to understand. Plus, he's hot and has a cool accent so you really can't go wrong.",1
"In my opinion, Alana gave difficult tests. Other than that, the course was fairly easy as long as you went to class and took notes. Alana is really passionate about music, so it makes it easier to pay attention. She makes even the most boring topics sound ten times more interesting, and she really likes to demonstrate by singing in class.",1
She is absolutely horrible. Very unclear on what she would like done. Also very rude. She waits till last minute to tell you exactly what you need done. Would not recommend taking her class!,0
This professor likes to repeat the same thing over and over. She is great but there are many things she could improve on. If you do all the work and put some effort into your presentations you should be able to get an easy A. She treats most of us as high school students so dont miss class and dont be late.,1
"Maher is a great guy and has a funny sense of humor. The first exam was very difficult only because I had no clue how his tests were. I suggest going over the slides, studying the animal families, and reading the book for more specifics. PAY ATTENTION to the things he mentions multiple times and even the side stories bc they are usually on the test",1
Professor Ambrose is an excellent professor and great person! He is very passionate & smart about business. If you attend the lectures & take notes it is an easy A. Class consists of 4 tests (no final) & 8 small HW assignments. He is also always willing & eager to help his students via office hrs and/or email. I highly recommend taking Professor A!,1
"He doesn't provide feedback on the quizzes/test, so if you get something wrong, which you most likely will with how strict of a grader he is, it feels extremely bad. All he does for lectures are homework problems and he offers no real guidance for students. If you want an A, it'll be really difficult depending on your own math skills.",0
Great class and a caring teacher.,1
Wow this guy is bad. Your quizzed at the beginning of every single class about things you had to teach yourself. Then you have to sit there for a lecture filled with tangents and that is never relevant to what you read. 2 people in my class have above a B. 9 have below a C. Find someone else.,0
Professor Dewart is a great professor. He has so much knowledge of the subject and has seen so much around the world. He truly cares that you learn.  Any student wanting to learn and not just pass the class should take him. He is inspirational.,1
"Professor Leung was fantastic. He cares more about learning than grades, and it shows. He is my first professor that allowed me to actually keep graded quizzes for review. He requires dedication, but if he sees you trying, he will help you. He is also really fun to be around, which helps when you have to be in his class at least 4 hours a week.",1
"In-class assignments every day, so your grade will drop fast if you miss. Extremely tough grader (I rarely got full credit for assignments and I'm an A student). She wants things done a specific way and if you don't ask questions or confirm how something should be done, you will lose points. There are easier teachers for this class.",0
"Super nice and funny. But don't take this class unless you need to. We only got graded on homework and tests. Goes super fast. A lot of homework. Its like she doesn't understand that we have other classes on top of her class. If you miss a day, you're super behind. She does give a lot of ways to practice including worksheets for basically everyunit",1
"AVOID, AVOID, AVOID!! Professor is very knowledgeable about Accounting but because it comes so easy for him he is terrible at teaching it to people who have never done it before. Half my class is confused & at the moment and I am having to pay for an outside Tutor to learn what I don't in class. He does NOT explain things well and goes very fast.",0
This professor is spastic and overworked. She does not reply to e mails and has no office hours. Her lectures offer no help on how to teach science and she is often side tracked with off topic stories. She grades hard on senseless things like reflections. Her assignments are not clearly defined. The class was not relevant. I was disappointed.,0
"He really is a nice guy who cares for his students but his well intended comments are option said to be creepy. His lectures are often very off topic and repeat the same stories, that are often inappropriate over and over again. He also belittles those who want to pursue clinical psych, but not really malicously, but it still gets annoying.",1
"i can see how this would be a great class in person but online wasn't great. It's read from the textbook then do the quiz, no notes, no lectures, no pre-recorded lectures. not impressed by this course delivery for online because of covid.",0
"Easily the worst college class I've taken. She assigns a lot of reading that is really hard to get through due to the content being repetitive and, in my opinion, too advanced for undergraduate students. Her lectures are her just reading off the power point slides. Discussion Board questions are often so specific the they are too hard to answer.",0
"Would not recommend at all. She's a tough grader. Literally so disrespectful, she shamed someone in front of the whole class because they didn't do their homework. She expects you to like and be good at music, regardless of major. Avoid at all costs.",0
"BE PREPARED TO READ A LOT! I understand this is college and there will be a lot of reading, but the amount of reading he assigns is crazy! He had us read about 6 articles 20+ each for an essay, and at the same time he wanted us to read 4 other articles 30+ pages each for our discussions. I've done more work in this class any class I've taken. ",0
Great professor! Explains material in a way I could understand. Very patient and fair. As long as you do the work you will pass the class. ,1
"decent teacher, but he is really strange with grades.  It seems like he just pulls a grade point average out of a hat to determine your grade.  Makes you believe you are doing better than you actually are as well.",0
"Stay away from any of her classes as much as you can! I used to wish that I could get hit by a car before going to her class. I cannot urge you enough to stay away from this professor. I may have gotten a decent grade but I had to fight tooth and nail for that. Please, stay away.",0
"I loved taking HKIN 226 with Angie! She is so passionate about what she teaches and she genuinely cares for us students. I would definitely recommend taking one of her classes. I wouldn't suggest assuming that her classes are 'easy.' You definitely need to put the work in if you wish to do well. Overall, this class was very inspiring.",1
The lectures were actually pointless for this class. MAKE SURE YOU READ THE TEXTBOOK!!! I learned all the stats I know from the textbook not him.,0
Awesome Teacher!  Very accessible for help outside of class!  Tests cover a lot of material.  Lectures can be a little rushed at times.  But she will always stay after to explain further.  Very good teacher!  Take her class if there's anyway possible.,1
Professor Chavez is a great instructor! She made the class fun and it was easy to understand the material with help from her and the textbook used. She responds quickly to emails when you need help with assignments.,1
"He is a complete waste of space what you learn in class does not pertain to the tests, which are based completely off the book. He spends most of his time rambling about nothing and I would have been better off taking a REAL programming class.",0
"awful prof, awful examiner",0
I wouldn't recommend this class to anyone. I chose this class with such high intentions and ending up being extremely disappointed. I am barely passing and the amount of work assigned is not normal. Please trust me. ,0
Not very engaging during the lectures and i personally need an engaging professor to learn and score well. Asked for a W in the class and he said that would be fine.,0
"I was so into her class, it was so much fun. I love English, I'd always go to her office hours for help to peer edit my essay and get more feedback. She was very helpful. BUT! She is not clear with assignments, hard grader, and has no sympathy. She said I was passing then gives me a NP. She's misleading. Don't take her. Just being honest!",0
"Honestly Dr. Monroe was the best professor I've ever had! If you want to take an interesting class and an awesome teacher, take any of Dr. Monroe's courses, I guarentee if you show up for class, you won't be disappointed! Do the work and study for the exams and you'll get an A. His lectures are amazing too, they keep you interested and entertained.",1
"Goes over material pretty fast.. you can do well in the class if you read the book thoroughly and study a lot. The TA's were pretty horrible, and I'm pretty sure they made up the midterm/final...",0
She makes class interesting. There is a lot of reading but manageable and she manages to make a boring story bearable with fun discussions. I have an A so I think she's a fair grader. ,1
"He's a great professor. He always explains what you can do better in your drawings, and will understand if you speak to him about any problems you have. Classes are very entertaining and he fully explains what we need to do for each assignment. Dont be afraid to ask questions. He grades you based on your improvement in drawing, not how good u are.",1
he was not helpful at all. was trying my best in his class and drop me supposly becuase of my absences B.S.,0
Get him out of here. Trevecca would be a better place without him.,0
"She is very smart and quite demanding. The text is hard even for native speakers (I met one on an airplane and asked for help interpreting). There is a lot of writing, like 3-5 pages, in french. Her english communication is not great so it's hard to ask questions for clarification. She'll never remember your name, even with only 8 people in class.",0
"This the worst teacher ever.  She talks like she makes a lot of sense but unless you are a research expert, you will never understand what she is saying. If you ask too many questions in order to clarify her teachings, she gets upset and is either rude or disregards what you say. In the end she did grade on a cruve but the stress doesn't compensate",0
This class was by far the toughest class Ive taken thus far. Tests were extremely difficult as there were no study guides given and when asked what would need to be studied we were told our 18 pages of outlines. Tests were very heavy as there were only 4 in the semester 2 of which were the final and midterm.,0
I was very displeased overall with Rob's tricky questions on tests; he is not clear with explanations and his lectures are brain-numbingly boring. He instills no interest in the material whatsoever.,0
"Write EVERYTHING he writes on the whiteboard! He is very particular in what he wants so make sure you cover everything he asks for.  Do all take home papers,  they seem tedious, but an easy way to get a 100 & count as a take home exam. He is all over the place & exams are hard, but he really wants to help you & gives you chances for retakes.",1
"Students discuss the subject, while she moderates. She never taught in the class, thus after paying 5K in uni fees you get opinions of ur peers & understanding from readings She is unable to keep her prejudices out of class & grading. If she dislikes you then it gets difficult Her approach is idealist & not policy based Take another professor",0
"Amazing professor! She is so understanding and can really work with you. If you do put in the effort, youll get an A! In addition, you received your grade with feedback within 2 days!",1
"Great class, great professor. The only thing that can be challenging is the group project. Other than that pretty easy.",1
"Her class was pretty boring and she just talked about herself. However, I took her during the summer semester and she got some pretty good speakers and I really enjoyed some of them. Also, she gives quizzes every week and its mostly online. Other than that she is a cool teacher.",1
"She sees students as peers. Anyone can stop her while giving lecture anytime, she will pay tons of patient back. She has a really good temper if you don't try to bully her. She also uses her academic life experience to encourage students. I am little bit afraid of math, but I believe I can even choose this as my major at the end of this semester.",1
I love this professor. Her classes are difficult but she is there and believes you can succeed. She is is wonderful professor and would recommend that everyone takes her course.,1
Love love love her! Eng 212 is generally a hard upper level class. But she made it so easy! We barely had any work. Her tests and assignments are so easy. She appreciates it if you participate but its not crazy mandatory. Take her you wont regret it.,1
really good teacher,1
"To be honest, I really don't think this is that bad of a class but the work load is intense. What makes it worse is he expects a lot on the papers so the class average is always around a B. We get a lot of projects to do and around five quizzes. If you do the work and try, you'll get a B. I think there's 1 or 2 in the class with an A-",0
"She's quick to respond and grade, and gives detailed feedback on project. Quizzes/discussions are simple, but tests are hard. She is vague/inconsistent on project so clarify any questions you have prior to turning in or you may lose points. The final is extremely hard and is 20% of your grade - many who had A's dropped to a B due to the final.",0
"The WORST professor I have ever had. I would give her a 0 if it was an option. Some of the questions on the exam we haven't even covered yet. Homework is online, and we only get 3 tries for each problem. Doesn't give extra credit, a tough grader, and never answers emails. Please just DON'T take this class if you want a good grade.",0
"She reads power points. It is obvious she is a very smart lady with multiple degrees, however she lacks in her teaching abilities. She is condescending when answering questions and is not a good ambassador for this school. I would not recommend her for A&P--very boring. She does review good for a test.",0
Very bad teacher!,0
This class was way too difficult. I have taken many psych courses here and this is one of the hardest. I'm a straight A student and I will be lucky to pass this class with a c+,0
He moved from Hofstra to NCC for anyone who is confused. He was amazing! At first I considered dropping him but I'm so glad I stuck with it. He's such a sweet man who cares about his students and is VERY passionate. Only grades are midtem&final plus some extra credit opportunities. I got a C+ on the midterm but ended up with an A in the class.,1
"If you must take this course, here's some advice: DO NOT listen to what the TA and prof say about failing the midterm-I swear they WANT students to freak out. All that is difficult is the format. If you complete the hw and understand it, the exams are simply re-worded hw probs. Do practice problems and don't depend on excel formulas to do them.",0
Melissa is a great teacher. I had her for Engineering in History online. It is literally the easiest class. For homework and exams just pull up your powerpoint and use the search functions to find answers. I only needed the book for one assignment. There were 2 essay projects but she gave everyone a perfect score. ,1
Took his IQL class and haven't gotten below a 95 on anything. Take his classes he's the best,1
"Ryburn is a sweet sweet teacher. Finite is a weeder class, but honestly I wish it were easier with being online. It is very hard to get a good grade in this place",1
Nice and awesome teacher. She really helps you out when you're having a tough time with a problem/,1
"If you are familiar with philosophy, you will enjoy this class. People who didn't like her didn't know what was going on in the class. If you can't understand things like the difference btwn objective & subjective, and you don't like philosophy, you will be bored. Class consists of 75% lecture and 25% questions. Sweet lady",1
"She is very nice and grades fairly. There are a lot of papers, but nothing too difficult.",1
In my entire collegiate career (15 years) By far the worst math teacher ever. Goes entirely too fast for those of us who are learners by doing. Skipping steps is not a good idea for calculus (the algebra is just as important). Be ready to teach your self the course. Exams are nothing like the book or his lectures. He gets a zero from me!,0
"Good teacher.  Do the work and get an A.  Lots of extra credit, can only miss a few classes.  Acquired good studying skills, learned how to take good notes. Didn't have to take this class and glad I did.  Keep up with easy homework and can get an easy A. Nice teacher",1
His classes are like big conversations and his exams are super easy,1
"The best english teacher ever. Read everything he assigns because there will be quiz. The content of the class is boring but he makes it so interesting. Take good notes, read, participate!",1
"Terrible, proud teacher. probably has a communication problem. She is intelligent no doubt but then feels you must be stupid if you don't understand the concept she is teaching. Would be a better teacher if she can communicate better. If you can take this class in another faculty.",0
Professor Rreze very well organized and neat. If you ever need to look over notes on a lesson or what assignments are due when you can easily access them through files on canvas. Her communication is also solid. She will reach out to you whenever you need help. As long as you turn in your assignments you are good.,1
"Quizzes are basically all trick questions. Multiple choice questions on the final are mainly straightforward, but some questions are tricky. The short answer questions on the final are about the most irrelevant details out of all the material that was covered (when you're studying, everything you think is useless is probably one of the questions).",0
Very helpful and is an amazing painter!,1
Was always there for when students needed help. A very supportive professor and he knows his subject well!,1
"I had her for my first and ONLY online class and she was extremely rude. I wasn't handling the online environment well and let her know that, but she wasn't receptive. She would send out email reminders for class discussion but not for quizzes!? She gave others full points for writing a sentence or two on discussion, so feel free to slack on that.",0
"While she is not the easiest grader, she is a wonderful professor. She is very knowledgable and you will definitely learn a lot from her classes. I've taken two classes with her and gained a lot from both of them. She also always grades fairly. She's  definitely my favorite professor so far.",1
"I wouldn't take her again if she was the last professor on campus. If you ask her a question, don't expect her to answer it. She is extremely unclear, unhelpful and quite confusing. Felt lost and in over my head all semester. To top it off, she can be pretty unnecessarily rude. Take someone else.",0
Great professor! He is super funny and gets to the point with his lectures. He normally ends class early and gives everyone time during class to work on their group projects.,1
"Intresting class. Made you think about sports in a different way. Tests were kinda tricky. Put in study time and you'll do well. Average final grade for the class was 81%. Paper was 8 pages and kinda annoying, but managable. The TA makes or breaks the class. A few pop quizzes so its good to go to class and also to write down small details he says.",1
"Dr. Feagin is an excellent History teacher! Her lectures are extremely organized and she includes fascinating topics.  There is a really big project for the class, but it's meant to be completed in portions over the semester.  The tests are long, but easy if you do the study guide beforehand, otherwise, you will bomb the tests. DO THE STUDY GUIDE",1
Did not like her at all! made me very uncomfortable. Did not feel at ease in her classroom.,0
"Awesome professor that pushes his students to do well in the class. Lots of different things are weighted to determine your grade, so doing poorly on a quiz or two is not a huge deal. Group projects are very fun and engaging. Professor McKnight is the man.",1
"The only redeeming factor of this ""seminar"" is that you don't have to attend to get an A.",0
"I love her, but she is too lenient! My class was very disruptive, I was always extremely agitated, but she never took action. Also because she lets you turn your homework in very late, students who should've never passed recieved A's. But if you need help, she will go out of her way to tutor you every day!",1
She is very interesting and funny,1
"Horrible professor! Do not take classes with this professor.  She is an unfair grader and not an easy teacher to get along with.  I agree with the other commenter that she is definitely gender biased, and I'm a girl! Take at your own risk.",0
"Horrible professor. Makes it seem like he's available outside of class but, doesn't even come to meetings schedule by email. Grades very hard on exams!!! The homework is worth 25% of the final grade. Lecture is boring and awful. Prepare to teach yourself. If your reading this, DONT TAKE HIM!!!!!!!",0
"I hated this guy while I had him, but in the end he passed me. This is not to say I didn't bust my backside trying, and in the end that is what made the difference. Study hard if you take him because that is all that will save you. Accounting is a miserable subject no matter who you take.",0
Hard class but accounting is hard unless you're an accountant. But Professor Sanborn will help you. She will give extra visits to campus and stay after class to help you understand. Beware she doesn't go strictly off the book.,1
Prof Knesek is a great professor and you can tell he really cares about his students. He prefers doing zoom discussions over discussion boards which was nerve wracking at first but it was a better discussion. There are group projects in this class which can be difficult to do over zoom but the rest of the work is not too bad.,1
"Network Architecture and Protocols was a living nightmare...Karvelas' slides we crap, his DL format was email vs. Moodle like everyone else, exams were absolutely impassable, and he didn't even admin his own exams...STAY AWAY!",0
"She is hilarious! The class will keep you listening. there are quizzes everyday in class so you have go to class. I liked my TA. TALK!!! everything that is asked, reply to, it gets you points, especially if you dont go to class often. Only 1 exam in the class, 5 speeches, 5 essays, 1 big video project at the end.",1
"Professor Thangaraj is EXTREMELY clear about his expectations from the first day: they are high! He expects a lot from his students and pushes us to be better than ""OK"".  Go to his office hours and go to class! Participation is key! Nice guy and easier grader than he originally seems. My favorite professor thus far at Vandy!!!",1
"She is not an easy grader, but you truly learn how to write in her class.  she is funny and nice.  Enjoyed her class",1
"She was very unclear, the books that she has us read are interesting though.  Your whole semester will be essays and pop quizes.  The essays are back to back and you rely on your classmates to look at your essays to revise them",0
"I will be very honest with my ratings. This prof. is very discriminatory when he grades. To get A grade, you need to take all of Comp Sc classes with him from CSC200. His behaviour is rude to new students. He discusses and forces his students to solve his personal issues. He will keep talk against other professors tha he is the best.",0
"She gives a lot of readings, and she never talks about the readings in class. The things she teaches in class are different from the reading but she somehow expects you to be able to connect the two together whether or not you understand the readings or not. you can definitely see her if you dont understand the class but really dont take this class",0
"Worst Professor I've ever had. Might be a smart guy, but he is a horrible professor. Doesn't explain ANYTHING in great detail. Just says you should know it ""intuitively"". It'll be a disgrace if he is allowed to teach at SMU again next year.",0
"Very experienced and knowledgeable professor. Perfect balance between teaching history itself as well as disciplines that can be used outside the subject. Lectures are very enjoyable. His grading is very clear and has a very strict requirement on the essays, which seemed somewhat dogmatic at first, but eventually REALLY helpful to my writing. 5/5.",1
"With out going to class you will fail. And study by going over the homework not reading the book. I really enjoy Dr. Steward, he is a good prof",0
"Professor Willoughby is a genius. The amount of knowledge this man has is amazing. He is a little disorganized, but if you do the readings you will be fine. The articles he assigns are extremely interesting if you are interested in international relations. Learned A LOT from this man and I am very grateful to have been able to take his class.",1
"You will have countless assignments and presentations, some even on exam day and you won't always even know what the assignment is due to the class being in Spanish. Exams aren't worth much so you have to try hard on everything. She likes to pick certain students to call on all the time, so try and pay attention. Class always runs long.",0
"Positives: he grades on such a generous curve you're bound to get a decent grade. Negatives: you must show up for ALL classes to take notes, and he gives homework every day. If he doesn't like you for whatever reason he is extremely rude and disrespectful! My friends and classmates have told me I should report him to the Dean for what he's done!",0
Talks really fast and is hard to understand at times. Simple class though. Lots of online homework.,0
"Hard to figure out when she is open to discussing my work. Very moody, as others have noted. Need to be independently oriented to succeed.",0
"By far the worst professor I have ever had. Very scatterbrained, doesn't have a marking scheme for exams. All the questions are open ended even though you are given the questions before the exams. Doesn't know what is the right answer for examinations and not willing to give extra marks, even if you have one portion right, if another part is wrong.",0
"Honestly, I was excited to go based on the reviews on this website. I use to enjoy writing, I was good at it. The problem with this teacher is that its her opinion on the subject you write on what kind of grade you get. Her grading is very unfair. Not pleased.",1
"My favorite teacher of freshman year. Cancels class more than most teachers, tells great stories, is funny and keeps you entertained. Quizzes are really easy.",1
"Great teacher. Belongs at a University. She is cooky and aging, but you can tell she is still sharp and knows what she is talking about. I would suggest going to all her classes and taking good notes. Even though she is super nice, her tests are tough. Study, do homework and complete all extra credit she offers.",1
Best professor I have had.  I have been in several of her classes and have learned so much in a short amount of time. Very interesting and her passion for teaching is apparent. I would love to take an Art History Class from her at Saddleback.,1
"One of my top 3 teachers. I had her for Fairy Tales and Fables and I wish I was allowed to take that class again. The class was a very open discussion about concepts and it was a class that we could think in. Only had 3 essays throughout the class, and we had plenty of time to think them out. She's so sweet, and very easy going. Loved this class",1
"If you want to learn the material well I recommend to take her. If you don't really care don't bother. Great professor and treats her students well! Not an easy class but it is a great challenge, recommend!",1
Very comprehensible,1
"She treats the class like elementary schoolers. If anyone says two words, she stops and says ""is my teaching interrupting your conversation?""  Doesn't give a lot of guidelines for the paper.It's just ""Write a critique about whatever you want:a book,a movie,a magazine,a restaurant,a video game, etc."" She is aslo nit-picky about punctuation on papers",0
"this is the worst class i have taken in my three years at hamilton; i advise you to avoid it like the plague unless you like unnecessary requirements and more work than you've ever gotten in your life.  while nice enough, werner expects everyone to have a significant background in world politics.",0
"He's a great professor! Favorites sociology teacher so far. Dissects the readings very clearly with the help of students' thoughts. Very inclusive and engaging. He has a personal story connected to pretty much about everything we talk about in class, so it makes things relatively easy to remember. Overall great!",1
"She was not a friendly person and giving everyone that feeling that she was seeing teaching as an errand for herself. Otherwise, she may know her stuff but knowing and teaching a class are completely different things.",0
"HORRRRRRIBLE!!!!!!!! DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR. Acts like you have your degree, gets mad at questions, arrogant, rude and makes you feel dumb. Dont let your gpa suffer. She explains nothing clearly and goes super quick in power points. Chem is about memorizing but she gave us a whole chart to memorize 2 days before an exam. Absolutely the worst",0
MG Whitney is the best math teacher I have ever had! DONT BE AFRAID ask her questions! she is SO willing to help every single way she can!,1
"Dr. Keyworth doesn't lecture, instead he creates an engaging discussion that makes you more interested in the material. Very approachable and will help you pick out a good research topic or clarify readings. He assigns a lot of readings but they are essential to answering the essay questions on the exams. Now I feel inspired to visit China. ",1
"I studied every day for this course and got deducted points for saying too much. I got an 85% avg mark for the lab portion with the lab instructors marking-which is all based off short answer but could only get no higher than a 71 for his exams. Super unfair prof, hes a nice guy but I would not recommend him to anyone.",0
"he is a great prof, term tests can get tricky but if you do homework it is easy to succed",1
"this class is incredibly frustrating. I learned more than I have in any other class at USC and actually enjoyed learning it, but I failed almost every single quiz. I studied everything he said during class and never missed a class, yet still did bad on every quiz and they're worth 50% of your grade. Final is a 12 page research paper.",1
He is great! Just be sure to pay attention in class and you should be fine.,1
"If you have the chance to take a class from LaBelle you must! She is so nice and down to earth. There is one midterm and a final but she provides study guides for both, but they are very easy. Lots of chances to boost your grade. She really cares about the students and makes sure to get to know each of us. Cant wait for another class with LaBelle",1
"rude, careless, unhelpful, seems lost. I mean, he is the only prof for CORP FINANCE and there is a huge waiting list for the online version of this class which explains a lot.",0
"I took this class online, its extremely easy. Never heard anything from him entire semester. Class can be finished in a few weeks",1
"I see that Dr. Phelps only has a 2.7 on here and I don't know why! He covers the material thoroughly, giving students a clear understanding of a subject he obviously loves. Yes, he expects you to study for tests. There are only 2, plus the final exam. The only other assignments are papers on videos we watch on various artists. He's great!!",1
he is a great teacher and very clear on assignments and willing to take the time to help if needed,1
"He's very nice but his class is lecture heavy. His interest is in entomology, and this was a beginner biology class. His exams are pretty easy as long as you study and use the study guides that he posts. He assigns readings for lectures, but I never actually read, but I'm sure it would help your grade if you did.",1
"The class was super easy, but also more helpful than I thought it would be. It was nice how Professor Nixon was always super bubbly and happy - it really made each class have a more social and relaxed feel. Things weren't always clear to begin with, but when you ask, she will go above and beyond to help you understand what it is you need to know.",1
She is a lovely professor and willing to help you with any kind of problems. She also will give advantage and chances. She is a gem.,1
"She's such a great teacher so helpful in General Bio lectures, gives plenty of extra credit sometimes the work can get difficult, you really do need to pay attention in class but if you do then not much studying outside class is needed, just the homework. i don't know about lab though. .",1
She is very good at photography but not a great teacher. Will instruct clearly on how to do things in the Photo Lab but doesn't clearly explain things about photography. Very nice & helpful!,1
She is the worst,0
"Good TA, very nice.",1
Took him for Summer 2 5 week(online). Only test in which he encourages the use of Quizlet when preparing for it. The test are from Quizlet. Stress free,1
"DO NOT take a class with her online. The course is extremely disorganized and she doesn't ever put grades up, so you won't know how you're doing. Also, she never answers e-mails. Although you'll end up getting a good grade if you do the work, you'll feel as if you learned nothing.",0
Horrible class structure and the professor is a bit crazy. I dropped this class because I had a bad feeling about him. He has lots of assignments and he is ridiculous about how he requires you to submit them. The class has a horrible structure and he treats the students like it is a second grade class.,0
"VERY BORING. class moves very slow even though material is easy. Could do the lecture in half the time but it drags. Allows one absence. Does a lot of group work during class that is pointless. Discussions, no textbook, essays, group projects. SO BORING and she is kind of confusing ",0
"The midterm was on material we never even covered in class. Is not very clear what is expected. He will say to ignore book on midterm but READ THE BOOK! It covers most of what is on midterm and final. Lectures are all over the place, more information in modules and book. Felt like he was not very concerned about students. Does not respond well",0
The Tests were extremely hard. Did not prepare you for the tests. Office hours were joint with her other class so she could not give you her full attention. Not that great of a professor.,0
"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!! Worst experience. She is so disrespectful towards her students, disorganized, yells at people who are trying hard, blames others for her own mistakes, and insults on a personal level. An overall really terrible experience.",0
"He doesn't use much words, leave the thinking to students to ask questions. quizzes and hws r pretty straight forward. Final is hard. Notes help but just to get brief idea. Requires large amount of time to do well in this class.",1
"Took this class this summer. 2 exams, one project, HWs, and bonus HW question. 50% on the exam and other 50% on HW, project and learn smart. To be honest, you have easy 50% on your hand and the Bonus HW question. HWs are easy but exams are not that easy. if you learn and understand the concept. This class is an easy A. Do bonus HW question!",1
"Absolutely the worst professor I've had at Allegheny thus far. Shame on the U of Pitt for awarding him a PhD. The chemistry tutors understand organic better than he does. He is incapable of answering chemistry questions on the spot, lectures are a waste of time,  class material is not the same as test and he's an unfair grader. Don't waste your $",0
"HE DOES NOT CURVE. 4 lengthy and involved questions on each exam and his partial credit is a joke. Not allowed to bring a formula sheet. The Class average was 40 both on exams before I dropped. He has admitted to having only two people pass before. He marks homework as ""ok"" easy padding to your grade,but it tells you nothing useful. Avoid.",0
"Even though it was very intensive because over the summer(only 11 classes),i got a good understanding of the material.However,we had quizes on every chapter plus 2exams and final.At least he was speaking loudly and slowly so it was easy to understand him.We solved a lot of problems from the book in class that helped a lot!I recommend this teacher!",1
"He does in fact grade like a jerk. Ethics is more about perspective, except that his perspective is what will give you a good grade. If you keep to his script and repeat back his own words back to him, he will grade you accurately and this class will be an easy A. I recommend this professor if you're okay with always agreeing with him. 1/10.",0
"The last two reviews hit the nail right on the head. Lectures can be 4 hours long sometimes, and the time allotted to finish tests/quizzes is unreasonable. I don't believe this Professor would flunk anyone, which is the only good thing, but I would NEVER take a class like this again.",0
Professor Walling is very passionate about his work as an anthropology teacher. He is in charge of a study abroad program in Belize for those who are interested. DO  NOT USE YOUR PHONE IN CLASS! The only exception  for this rule is if you're using your cell phone to record one of his lectures. He talks fast. I found his office hours very helpful.,1
Excellent teacher! She has a focus in education and really understands how to teach. She offers lots of extra credit and is helpful. She will only lecture for 20 or so minutes and makes sure you understand the material. I think she could teach any subject well. Wish there were more professors like her!,1
"Ms. Walker is very unorganized, won't make time for you, and doesn't care about her students at all. I asked her for help when I was struggling n quizzes and her advice was to change my major because I wasn't good enough to be a nurse. Seriously, she's rude and doesn't care cuz she's head of department. Worst professor I've ever had DON'T TAKE HER!",0
Couldn't in anyway explain the marking system that he utilized in attributing grades for mid-terms. His entire process smacks of the arbitrary.,0
"If you're in his class for Quantitative Methods, I have only one piece of advice for you. GET OUT NOW! How he is qualified as a teacher is beyond me. You will not LEARN anything, but you will pass his in-class tests very easily. Beware come exam time as the only thing you will only have learned how to copy off others. Ho' Boy, Enjoy... ",0
"CDR Felker is an expert in his field. He gives excellent lectures and is very fair with grading. Not a lot of writting compared to other sections of HH104. Great guy, highly reccomended",1
Very enjoyable class! She does a really great job of making the class interesting while still giving you the tools you need to be successful in the class.,1
Not clear on expectations.,0
"Yes, you have to teach yourself and a little more work than what you would expect from a 100 level class but overall if you do the work there's no reason you can't get a B or higher. Uses old exams by copy & paste and once you get a feel for the class not too bad. Usually gives extra credit for tests which help out a lot.",1
"Very rigid, dont take his class",0
"This class sucked. Never would I recommend taking her, she gives a lot of assignments and test. She expects a lot out of you. We did 2 chapters a week, plus discussion plus a test. She is not very helpful at all. I would never take her!!!!!!! Plus she takes forever to turn in grades.",0
"Dr. Quick is a very good instructor. Dr. Quick doesn't offer extra credit or practice tests for the weekly tests. But if you follow the study plan provided by Pearson, do the HW and then do the tests, you should have no problem passing. Dr. Quick offers feedback and responds attentively to questions. He is flexible with outside situations as well.",1
"AJ is one of the best teachers I've ever had. She knows everything there is to know about ASL and the Deaf community. We got off topic in class a lot, but it always came back to signing. She also gives plenty of extra credit opportunities if you need it. It's very easy to get an A, as long as you pay attention in class.",1
"Unclear on assignments, had us set our own due dates. Purposely graded tests wrong so u can correct her and get bonus points. If u like nature and writing about trees, this is your class. Otherwise, stay clear. She cancelled 8 classes this semester, not including holidays.",0
"WOW. thats all i got to say. he's the best prof ive ever had. EVER! he's super helpful with anything your having trouble with. follow the hand outs and the readings in class and you should be great. again, amazing.",1
who cares... look at him!,1
"Don't take him .This class was  stressfull, difficult  ,and boring , with no help  .I was studying so hard , and at the end I got   a C  but for a moment a though I will not pass this class .I'm not going to see this professor  again .",0
"Other reviews on this site complain that Dr. Paler gives too many readings and assumes we have previous knowledge of political science - I hardly think that is the case. Her lectures were interesting and engaging, and she lectures with the hopes that you have read the readings. Super smart and exciting lectures, I definitely recommend this class.",1
"Chapter tests every week but you do get 3 chances to take the test, however, it is at the testing center which is so inconvenient. He also times how long he teaches for which is 7 minutes. Every class you do group work either questions or figure from book. When we were home he gave 2 3 chapter tests with only 1 try which was so annoying on proctoru",0
"Great teacher. Go to class, pay attention, participate, do the assignments are you're set. Perez-Picasso makes the language easy to understand and a fun class to be in.",1
"12week DL spring 2019: I am not a huge reader & not big into history. Yes, theres hmwk. Expected. Everything is very clear and to the point. Do the work and you'll make an A/B. Hmwk/Test come from your book. No testing center required. Take test at home. Discussion board every other day per week-no wknds. Not that bad. EVERYTHING COMES FROM BOOK.",1
"He's ok ... material is straight from the book. Gives several examples to clarify terms. Like prev note, DON'T BE LATE. He is very big on attendance & participation. On the eye contact thing, don't forget he's not American. For some ppl, eye contact is rude - so that's kinda understandable. He is kinda funny.",1
Wish there was another professor to teach this course at Fresno state. She doesn't offer plenty of extra credit which seems reasonable considering her test are extremely hard. You need to study so much for this class. She's tough on her students and expect you to know everything.,0
Nordling is a very hard professor. His tests are unpassable. He only gives three grades if you mess up one your done. He doesn't tell students what to study or even give hints he just says study the entire first six weeks. If at all possible do not take him.,0
Professor/Dean Lanham is amazing! Love her!,1
DO NOT TAKE HIM FOR BIODIVERSITY. I had him for bio 2 and he was fair so I thought this class would be a good one to get my ecology credit. NOPE biggest regret. He tries to teach us everything he knows which is very overwhelming and we end up not learning anything. About to graduate as a bio major and this is the hardest class Ive taken.,0
"Worst professor ever. Avoid at all costs. She is soooo unclear with grading criteria and graded very tough. Our lab group asked a ton of questions so that we would get things right, but she always changes her mind about what she wants from you so asking questions doesn't help. Makes a ton of mistakes and thinks it's cute or funny. Extremely unclear",0
"He was the best math teacher I've ever had throughout high school and college. To put it into better perspective, I took this course spring 2017 and failed with another teacher and retook it fall 2017 and got an A. He will do anything to help you understand or get a good grade. Even resubmit assignments. Very easy going, and a day-brightener",1
The hardest class I took in my 4 years. The exams were near impossible and the discussions were graded tough. This class was a mistake and if you need to take a class for a natural science credit this is not your class.,0
"Great professor. Keeps things interesting and lectures are well-organized. Invites open discussion often and really knows her stuff. Reading and writing requirements were kind of demanding, but it was an upper level class so that's to be expected. Would definitely take another class with her.",1
"Lisa is one of the worst professors I have ever had, hands down. I have had for a few classes now and she is a good teacher when in the classroom but her online classes are some of the worst experiences I have had at school. She is the least helpful teacher I have ever had both in and out of the classroom.",0
"RJ was the bomb! He made this class seem like a breeze compared to what I've heard of the other sections. 7 online quizzes, and 4 noncumulative exams make up your entire grade. His study guides/powerpoints cover everything that will be on the exam, and he offers extra credit for every exam. Posts the powerpoints, with the answers, online! Take him",1
absolutely ridiculous grader.  he teaches ANTHROPOLOGY yet tries to grade everything else.. unfairly.,0
"Do not expect full credit on anything, even when it is deserved. She is a tough teacher who treats you like professional journalists. If you are anything BUT a journalism concentrator, do not take this class anyway. Find something else. I would not recommend taking her, she doesn't teach at all. No tests or quizzes, just articles and blog project.",0
He is a really nice guy.,1
"Dr. Hernandez is a great professor. His methods of teaching an online calculus class work wonders! A 5-week course is tough, but his syllabus makes it possible to pass and learn a lot as you go. Follow his directions, do the assignments and ask for help early. He does an amazing job explaining concepts in ways that truly help! I recommend his class",1
"Very hard, her tests are nothing like the review and the questions are VERY VERY VERY hard and she goes through the material very fast. Very hard teacher, if you can, please don't take her!",0
he is great online. very easy... quiz are 5 pts and short essay are 14pts. give you enough time for everything!!! ask questions he can help!!! great teacher overall!!!,1
She was a miserable teacher to learn under and almost drove away my drive to learn Japanese.  I refuse to be taught by her ever again.,0
Hardest class ever. The tests and group work were almost impossible. The amount he had to curve this class was absolutely ridiculous. He curved some tests by 4 letter grades and curved the entire class by a letter grade and a half.,0
"WOW!! Dr. Lin is amazing. I would take her class over and over and over again. She is extremely approachable and designs her lectures to be interactive and clear. Difficult exams though, that you MUST study for in advance. You will not be able to skate by...",1
By far the worse and meaningless class so far. He spends 60% of time talking nonsense and inappropiate things not related to class. Then rushes 10 mins before class expecting us to know all the info before exam in next class. Expects us to read the chapters byt vaguely discusses them in class. Long study guide with short and long answers required.,0
"It was so horrible. I had no idea that I alone was the reason for all the suffering of all women. Crazy. I didnt mean to. My bad, I wont do it again.",0
"i know im not the best at chemistry, but Dr. Bushey was very rude even when it not intentional, writes everything on his screen so its very messy and hard to read, an tests and quizzes are very difficult",0
"I took this class to fulfil my history requirements and Prof. Liebman's class is perfect for it since it's easy and no final. You do have to submit homework every week and do 2 papers though. She does tend to go offtopic a lot. If you want to learn, it's better to take other teacher however if you just need credit and easy A, get her class.",0
"I have never had a tougher grader than Dr. Burck. I have a 4.0 in grad school and he definitely has not made it easy. No matter how much you write or how closely you follow his examples, its still wrong and not enough. Hope I never have to take him again.",0
"she is the worse teacher i have ever had, Her course material is unclear, she does not reply to any of your emails, she does not post anything that makes sense or streamlined with the material she gives. does not keep in contact or even post your overall grade. forget about extra credit, there is none,  she just throw things online and not clear. ",0
"Professor Allen is knowledgeable and funny. Sometimes his lectures are really boring, but he shows a lot of great movies and books. I think his grading is fair as long as you pay attention in class and read his notes online.",1
"Incredibly rude and irritable, hair trigger anger. Incredibly particular in aspects that wont matter in future classes. Seemed bitter she was teaching a 100 level course and not higher level. The worst I have ever had and hope to ever have. If you have to stay at Hunter another semester to avoid her do THAT instead. Unrealistic expectations also.",0
"Prof. Gartland is a very sweet lady & she cares about her students. One important thing to note is that you will want to attend the live meetings because she throws bits of important exam info out in the meetings. Her off topic tangents are useful- sometimes exam questions are based on them. Overall very easy. Shes a little unorganized, thats all.",1
"Nice professor, but his work is strenuous. Don't expect to get higher than a ""D"" on his 15-page papers unless you're graduating-- in that case you get a ""C!"" Do ALL of your journals! His grading is TOUGH! He only gives essay tests. Watch out!",1
Best professor and extremely helpful in all areas of the courses he teaches. He specializes in ECOLOGY and ENVIRONMENT so if you are looking for something other than this obviously you go to someone who specializes in that subject area.,1
"I personally loved having him for Psych 304, everything was made very clear during lectures and he goes over the problems specifically. His tests are kinda weird bc he focuses a lot on math during lecture but his tests have conceptual idea that need to be explained thoroughly in order to get credit. I recommend honestly",1
She knows her stuff but her lectures are soooo boring! She puts the slideshows on the internet but they aren't helpfull on tests. Homework and tests are online masteringbiology.com THE HOMEWORK IS WHAT YOU NEED TO USE TO PREPARE FOR TESTS! STUDY FROM MASTERINGBIOLOGY HOMEWORK. She takes attendance. if you miss three labs you fail the class,0
loved him! He was so nice and understanding and teaches the material clearly. Just do the assigned stuff and you'll pass with a B- or higher.,1
"He is the worst professor I've had in my whole college experience. He expects you to go out of your way to see art pieces, know the proper way to critique it, and makes you write so many papers that are pointless and a waste of time. His grading is so hard, it's almost impossible to get an A anything. If you get him as a professor, GOOD LUCK!",0
"Melissa is the saint of all saints, highly recommend taking her class if at all possible.",1
"Brooke is great! I took her for Trig, which i was nervous for. She always wanted to make sure we understood what she was teaching. Her lectures were never boring. Her class is weighted heavily on your exams, so make sure to study. Overall, she is a really understanding and fun teacher to take.",1
"CHEM 205 is a heavy course, but Dr. Rogers makes it bearable. Fantastic lecturer, and is very clear as to what will be on exams. Practice her past midterms and finals, study her lecture slides, do OWL practice problems, and most importantly, show up to all of her lectures. Rogers wants her students to succeed and is definitely a top-tier prof.",1
I had an awful experience in this class and I highly recommend to avoid taking his class.,0
Nobody I knew got above 60% on their tests and we all went to every class and studied before each exam.,0
"One of the best philosophy professors at Colgate. He really knows what he's talking about, and makes it easy to understand. Great corny jokes! Participate, do the reading and take decent notes, and you're set.",1
"Professor Gullì was a delight to have, his accent makes it hard to understand whats going on if youre not really paying attention. Overall a great professor and a great guy.",1
"I have Ms. Triggs for clinical. She is an awesome professor! She's sweet, nice, and funny, but also fairly direct and will definitely tell you when and where you need to improve. She's clear with deadlines and expectations and quick on email replies. I hope to get her for a future class.",1
Your not going to have a good time.,0
"Professor Talbert is such an awesome professor! It's very clear to see his passion, and it seems as if he knows everything possible about the history of Rome. His expectations are very reasonable and the TA's were great as well. Sometimes the lectures were a little boring, but he randomly cracked jokes throughout which made it so much better.",1
"I didn't know anything about database and learned so much. There are many parts to this subject. It was hard going for a while, but she tells you too it will all come together and it does. She's gracious and helpful. We were provided many different databases to work with at different levels of difficulty. Lots of hands-on modeling and coding.",1
"Norris was so distant from his students. He didn't even know the SI's name for this course. Exams were curve balls. Whole grade for the semester was based on TWO EXAMS AND THE FINAL - and some points for the partnered lab section. He made studyguides, but refused to post them or the powerpoints to CC. Wouldn't take him again.",0
"This is the worst class I have ever taken. She locked down my final semester grade before she had graded everything yet. Suddenly I ended up with a C instead of a B. She never replied any emails, dont even bother to try to email her, she wont respond. Give you bunch of videos to watch. You can find them on youtube and teach yourself.",0
"awful directions, expects everyone to care about art even when none of us are art majors and that we should just leave because we were wasting his time, told me today that he may have thrown my paper away because there is another kid in the class with the same last name and that made it confusing. 70% of grade is in the final week.",0
"This was the second semester I've had this professor, and I'm very pleased with my experience. I recommend her to anyone taking a Spanish class.  I like her teaching style and I feel I actually improve my Spanish while in her class. She is very a sweet woman and I look forward to possibly taking her again.",1
"Honestly, the way he presents the material in class makes it so much more interesting! Always keeps you entertained with his loud and dramatic voice, loved it! One page essays are due every week with lots of requirements to it and sometimes the TA's grade way too harshly. However, there's LOTS of extra credits and will help you get an A :)",1
"Bad instructor, way to fast. I want to say something nice about her as an instructor. but I can't. she is nice as a person though! DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!",0
"I would make sure that if I ever have the chance to take another class with him I will. He was extremely helpful, very knowledgable, and passionate. DEFINETELY choose his professor... best one at WCC I have taken yet!",1
"Horrible teacher. He is inconsiderate, and is very unwilling to help.",0
"She got me into art and I learned alot. She was fun and a great teacher.I look at art in a new way now, and look foward to going to a museum.",1
She literally reads word for word from PPT and expects you to know how to do the practice questions prior to class. Her online homework assignments take hours on end to complete. Don't recommend taking this class with her at all!!,0
Lectures are hard to understand because of the teachers accent. The teacher goes too fast and is not clear with explaining. The teacher assumes you should remember everything after just going over it once. I was not prepared for tests at all.,0
"So, any good comments must have been writtenby this prof; clarity is absent; speaks in phrases, not sentences. There is no cohesion. Should be a libray science instructor or a scheduler for author appearances at bookstores. All her classes are EXACTLY THE SAME! DOesn't anybody check what goes on at ECSU?",0
MS. GARCIA WAS A EXCELLENT TEACHER AND HAD A GREAT CONNECTION WITH EACH AND EVERYONE OF HER STUDENTS. SHE WAS VERY FAIR AND REASONABLE WHEN IT CAME TO GRADING PAPERS. I WOULD RECCOMMEND ANYBODY TAKING A CLASS SHE IS TEACHING.,1
"He is absolutely awful. He doesn't use online resources like d2l, his lectures are not clear, every exam has super low average and he doesn't even tell us where we stand on class. He doesn't post solutions to exams or homework. He is not helpful in office hours either. The syllabus he gave at the beginning of class doesn't even include exam dates.",0
"I signed up thinking this would be a fun French film class. He has taught it before and made that clear, heres the catch... it was a new book. He gave insane amounts of homework for absolutely no reason then we spent the whole class GOING OVER the homework. I learned nothing at all. Grading criteria was switched two weeks before the final.",0
She's the WORST prof I have ever had in my life. Seriously terrible. She reads off the slides and tests you on pictures but wont put them on D2L. She doesn't answer questions properly and tells you to look in the textbook. Her lectures are 100 pages per lecture and they are PACKED with information. Midterms 45% of grade. 10/10 do not recommend.,0
One of my favorite professors,1
"This was the worst class I took this semester and I don't recommend to anybody. He does not explain instructions very well. He moves onto new topics very quickly without asking. He does not use canvas to assign us homework, grade or discuss material. Makes us text him via cellphone to send assignments. His phone rings often over zooms. Trash class.",0
"Took a month to return our first paper, when he finally did he was grading them as he handed them back. He's incredibly arrogant, would go off on 15 minute tangents about how he met Denzel Washington one time, told us that our dreams are proof of parallel universes (how does this relate to Chicano Literature...?) Worst teacher I've ever had.",0
I am not a science person but I'm so glad I took my science courses with Christy. She was so patient with helping me understand each lesson. Her lectures were so thorough and clear! I would deff recommend her!!!,1
"He's funny, smart, and just a great man in general. I can't wait to take another one of his classes.",1
"Prof Lovelace is very helpful. With every essay you get back, not only does he really spend time leaving comments on your paper, but he gives the whole class a general revision packet on what the class as a whole needs to work on from that essay too. There's nothing wrong with that southern accent either! ;-)",1
"Solid lecturer, would definitely take another class with him. Lots of readings to do, so just prioritize your time. Ask questions, he likes that.",1
"I took him for Ultimate Questions and he made a religious class more open and discussion based, which was good for people who weren't religious. He depended on the books for his lectures and his tests, but he gave funny and romantic stories with his lectures. It is hard to know when it take notes due to the stories, but just write down the concepts",1
"Very passionate, but is NOT meant to teach online. Tests are IMPOSSIBLE, filled with arbitrary questions and poorly worded. Opens himself up to class criticism but does not take it well. Content was not difficult, but the format of his class made it hard to learn. Blackboard is poorly organized. Great guy, very knowledgable, just not a good teacher",0
"I loved Ms. Epley! She's full of good energy and really shows that she cares about her students. She does everything in her power to try and help her students the best she can. She will however see if you're slacking and will call you out on it. As long as you don't slack and show good effort, you'll do fine.",1
As long as you put in the effort she will take late work. But make sure she likes what you are doing or she may grade harsher,1
He is a nice guy but he is SO BORING! I feel like stabbing myself cause he's that boring! I was so excited to take Hinduism but all he talks about is Buddhism! He doesn't use the textbook at all. His test and quizzes are easy. Do NOT take him if you want to learn about Hinduism cause you won't! DO take him if you want a good grade for credit hours!,0
Professor Hays is a remarkable instructor.  He allows his students to learn and gain knowledge while relating it to real life situations and challenges.  His sincere concern for his students shows through his teaching.,1
"I have mix feeling about this guy! Heres the thing, his test are not hard. Its from his lectures and multiple choice questions from the study guide. Hes an extremely hard marker for weekly assignments and I feel like hes not approachable when you need help. I managed to get in the 80s bc I did well on the final. You can get him but be prepared",0
SHES A PERKY TEACHER THAT LOVES TEACHING! shes really energetic and thats what makes the class worth going to.,1
Originally went into this class unsure if I would care much for it but it ended up being my favorite class this semester! Matlack is so passionate and knowledgable so his lectures were always enjoyable. Make sure you write down all the in class notes and draw his little doodles. Your notes will end up looking like a field journal by the end!,1
Very strong accent that I could not understand at all. I'm currently taking this class and regret it very much. I wish I would have not purchased the book and have chosen a different professor. He does not go over examples with students like other Math teachers. Avoid if you can.,0
She's a good professor who gives good feedback and is accessible outside class. She prefers to be notified if you won't be showing up to class. There is a lot of homework and writing to do but that's because its an english course.,1
I feel this is the hardest and most awkward class I have ever taken. He's a cool teacher and all but just AWFUL methods. I highly suggest taking any other teacher you possibly could!!,1
"The class itself is super easy, but I wasn't the most fond of Gray as a professor. I liked her at first, but from some of the remarks she's made I realized she's kind of an insensitive person. Aside from that, get ready for boring group projects, being treated like a 12 y/o and lectures that seriously drag. Should've taken the 6 week online course",0
"I dreaded this class every day! The class was so unorganized and not very interesting at all. The tests were common sense and never opened the book. As long as you go to class you will do fine on the tests. Marty is very credible and has a lot of accolades, but the other professor I had, You Li, was nice but not a good teacher.",0
literally the hardest math class i have ever taken and this is supposed to be easy. hell spend a whole class doing one problem and then by the end hes done the whole thing wrong. hard to understand when he speaks. i learn more from the homework and teaching myself then from him,0
"Avoid at all costs. Refused to answer students questions on designated exam review days, because he ""didnt know if the questions would work out"". Lectures last an average of 20 minutes",0
"This professor actually believes you would be paid ""the big bucks"" to do complex calculations by hand. He assigns much more homework than other professors teaching the same class, however, he doesn't cover the material or work examples. Your only resource is the book and the lecture notes he posts. He provides a pdf book which saves money. Avoid",0
"I do not reccomend taking her, she never knows where you are at in the class / grades, test are at a doctors level since she use to be a doctor  she expects you know everything right away. Does not go in order, make sense, and like no extra credit. Your grade is pretty much on your tests & our class averages were never over a 60%! Good luck",0
"Mrs. Warden is every freshman's nightmare. She manages to make ENGL 1010/ 1020 so unnecessarily difficult by her impossible ""grading"" rubric. You can do everything she tells you and she'll still take off points with no explanation. If you aren't clear about what to do, she'll simply say ""I already told you"". Her emails are unprofessional and rude.",0
a very gifted teacher...but talks too much. it seems like she has to cover every little thing in the book and still add more stuff.her three hour lecture classes are just too much. doesnt give too much time for lab(20 min tops/wk im serious) i also think she gives you very tricky quiestis for the exam.im def. not taking her for a&p2.,0
"Good luck if you have anxiety, this class was about as calming as having rapid shots fired at you. He LOVES to dock you points for MINOR errors, despite his lectures and feedbacks having fair shares of typos. One of the worst classes I've taken.",0
"unclear lecture notes, not well explained, too much data less information and knowledge",0
Great lectures and really compelling projects through which I learned a lot about basic machine learning and computational biology,1
"I took this class as a GPA booster and boy was I wrong. For the midterms, Mary gave us the format and told us to review the 16+ lecture slides. Too much information and I didn't know what to focus on so it was hard to study for the exam as it was too broad. The info was also all mixed up and hard to follow :(",0
"Lois is a trainwreck. For an instructor of a class with the stated aim of ""open-mindedness"" and ""objective analysis"" of political systems, she does nothing but  opine. This leads to a poor educational environment. I don't know how anyone could or would recommend Lois' classes to anyone",0
She isn't a hard grader but she doesn't clarify things. The syllabus is different than her course content portion so the assignment was very hard to complete. She beats around the bush to answer your questions and never actually answers the question. The discussion questions were not clear so I didn't know what I was supposed to be answering.,0
"One of the best profs I have ever had. Especially during the pandemic, she was super understanding and very lenient. Grades consist of 3 exams, 1 very easy project where you have the choice to work alone or with a partner/group and weekly quizzes. The exams were very easy just study the lecture slides and there's no textbook.",1
Doctor Heth is a great teacher who also cares about his students.  His teaching helps integrate our faith with real life.  I wish there were more professors like him!,1
"This is absolutely NOT a class that is meant to be online. The first two months of this class was studying on how to execute a good *informative* speech, and the kicker? The speech had to be given LIVE, as in, OVER THE COMPUTER, and we had to emphasize ""eye contact?"" What a joke. This class should've been cancelled indefinitely.",0
"Terrible professor. Very difficult tests and quizees which the class is not properly prepared for. Most people in class recieved low grades in the C range. The MOST BORING teacher i have ever had, he talks in a monotone voice. Very inconsiderate with his grading.Recieved a bogus participation grade DNT TAKE. One of the worst teachers ive ever had.",0
"I hated this class. Dreaded every test. Assignment due dates would deviate from schedule. Lectures were literally just reading off the PPTs. He NEVER covered examples. Seemed like a nice dude, but you absolutely will be teaching yourself in this course.",0
Dont take him for Pre Calculus! Stressful. He talks very fast and when you ask him to go over he will get an attitude. He doesnt allow formula sheets AT ALL. YOU ONLY HAVE 4 grades and thatss his tests. YOU ONLY USE YOUR PAST PAPERS AS STUDY GUIDES FOR THE FINAL EXAM. He gives out homework and practice problems but doesnt count them as a grade.,0
"Worst prof I've ever had.  Made our entire class redo an assignment because he said none of us did it correctly, failing to realize he clearly is not good at communicating what he wants.  Quite harsh as well in his criticisms and expects you to do a LOT of work per assignment.  Tough marker as well.  Avoid this class if possible!",0
"Prior exp recommended, not req'd f/program-- maybe it should be due to lab. Go fig, 3 labs & they R never ""open"", false advertising. BTW, 10 peeps failed the catheter 1st time, it's a program issue. I have gone above & beyond what is req'd class wise. When I was looking into exp COC called. At least I got away from YOU! Why do ya care A.F.?",1
"Potential students,Please take your preq.; know it well. has a power control issue. He will tell U up front, he always win. What ever you do do not challenge his authority, He will target U through out the course and make it very difficult for U.",0
"I have always received an A in every math class I have ever taken. I love math but this professor nearly ruined it for me. Every class is a lecture with note taking but ALL OF THE NOTES ARE WORDS, NO MATH PROBLEMS ARE SOLVED. He made something simple seem extremely confusing and he YELLED LOUDLY at us because of it. I didn't go back. Disrespectful!",0
Sondra Ricar in my opinion is not an excellent instructor because she has negative opinions about students and quite frankly she doesn't try to help students succeed in the course and if you do something wrong when you know you didn't she accuses you rightaway and is a terrible judge of character.,0
Provided us additional materials such as study guides to help with consolidating information. Quizzes were straight forward and from the book. The powerpoint lectures were helpful to learn material. Exams are basically straight from the powerpoint learning objectives. Strongly recommend him for BMS 251,1
Shes not helpful when you go into her office or ask for help during work time during class. The beginning of the semester seemed like a lot of busy work which didn't help at all. I don't recommend taking her because she's not helpful and her lecture days are just her rambling on about useless information. Only good thing is she split up the project,0
"I took this class online, and it is a big unorganized, the class schedule was out of whack. As I was preparing for a particular chapter the class schedule stated would be that week, it ended up being a completely different chapter. He took almost 2 weeks to grade discussion boards. And your grades are based on the test and the DB postings.",0
Dr. Viola is the BEST teacher for a core science class. There is no reason for any grade below a B. Along with all the jokes he makes a 3hr lab (which never is 2hrs) very entertaining. His ability to help students as well as make them laugh results in a good learning enviroment whit little stress and anxiety.,1
"Exceptionally poor communicator, not engaged in the class. Assignments took weeks to grade, when requesting feedback and support on lab and homework assignments it was seldom to never provided. Video lectures read from the slides, almost like she didn't know the material. She cared more for APA style than content of assignments.",0
"Definitely teaches from experience. The book is unnecessary to buy, read his slides and you'll skate through. Interesting man and has a great sense of humor. The class is entertaining and teaches you a lot. The important things about business law that are relevant even to one not studying the subject. Definitely take this professor.",1
shes so nice!! loves what she does and cares about her students. awesome accent not hard to understand what shes saying. take her hist of arch class if you need to take a history class!!,1
"Dr. V is awesome, and I am really not a religion person so that's saying a lot. He's super openminded, encourages disagreement & healthy discussion. He gives CLEAR grading criteria and incredibly helpful study guides - if you study and do the work, you'll have a high A. Takes attendance every class but no matter how late u are he'll  mark u present",1
"you will not pass her class , do not take, please,",0
"I took the computer deal of his class, where you do the course online but you're in a class with him. I liked the program and his teaching style is nice, you raise your hand, ask your question and you get a PERFECT answer, and I SUCK at math, I mean with a capital S. He's very mellow, chill, and funny at times.",1
"Jody is an not that good of a prof. She's very strict and not understanding at all. There are so many assignments and so much reading. You are expected to remember every single detail for every quiz. Be prepared to pull all-nighters for this class. I usually love/look forward to english, but it pained me to come to this class.",0
"He's great to take for an animation class, but when you suck at drawing, you better drop the class. He is absolutely impossible to talk to outside of class, and his classroom wasn't the greatest focus environment for me, so I only attended if there was something important. He doesn't really tell you what he grades on either. Just gives you a grade.",0
DON'T TAKE ALYCE HUNTER. She has made it clear that she doesn't care about anyone's situation during this pandemic. Shes a tough grader - no one gets full credit she always takes off one point for spelling/grammar but can't even spell check herself. Group work is mandatory in this ONLINE CLASS. ALWAYS emails back late & super vague/condescending,0
"DO NOT pick this professor!!! Nothing is organized, she is extremely rude and hard to work with. She reads from powerpoints for the whole time you're in class, even the lab is just another lecture of something so unrelated from regular lecture. She's VERY unreasonable and says community college students are spoon fed. DON'T DO IT!!!!!!!!!!!!",0
"WORST DAMN TEACHER EVER!
 Not only can she not stay focused during class, she needs to ask for a copy of the syllabus just to see when her own assignments are due.
 
 Worst of all she is just a mean lady.",0
"Worst class I have ever taken. Professor is unorganized and does not follow his slides. I can honestly say I've learned nothing in this class. Tests are multiple choice, but don't follow what he *attempts* to teach in lecture at all. Do not take this class unless you absolutely have to.",0
"Dr. Harvey knows how to teach. She is patient and helps students whenever she can. Study her practice exams, they'll be helpful for the exams (4 exams including final). she drops the lowest grade if you do well on the final. Don't miss her lectures if you want to learn.",1
"Professor of the decade goes to Professor Davis. She respects students, tries to help them, and wants them to succeed. Amid a switch from in class to online due to Covid19, we were lucky to have her as a guiding light. She helped us make that transition with ease. While this class can be challenging at times, she is always there to help. The Best!",1
"She's a very good professor. Very passionate about the subject. Her lectures go very in depth because she fully explains every formula, theory, etc. Even when the students only need to know how to plug the numbers into the formula. HW can be frusturating because the website looks and runs like an early 2000s site.",1
"tends to rant about random topics in class. He'll pick out really obscure historical events and focus on them for days. Not too bad, but definitely not fun. One time we actually talked about the rap group fu-schnickens for an entire class period. other than that though it kinda sucks. research papers are the only grades. avoid him.",0
"He is a nice guy who loves to joke around. He's not a strict grader, or strict about anything really. Not good for super serious students.",1
"Overall, Dr. Lyons is a great prof. If you enjoy Archaeology or if it is your major, you will likely enjoy the breadth of material covered in her course. However, there is an ungodly amount of information crammed into this course and she goes fast. Notes are minimal and no study guide for exams, so be prepared to memorize a lot of material.",1
I would avoid taking his class. He does not answer questions and his instruction is hard to understand.,0
This professor helped me to obtain scholarships as well!,1
She is tough. Hard to pass her class. She does not tell you what to expect out of your speeches and expects them to be A+ material. She is mean and unpleasant to talk to.,0
Amazing!! take her if you have the chance you will not regret it. Took her 3 times have received an A every time.,1
He's a smart guy if you're listening. He was a NASA engineer for 20 years and spent time teaching in the military. The kind of person who would say anything bad about a teacher like this aren't the types of people you want to listen to. Trust me. I took him for Math 1410 and learned a great deal because I was paying attention.,1
I LOVE DHAVAN.  MY FAVORITE PROFESSOR IN DEPARTMENT AND ONE OF MY FAVORITES IN THE UNIVERSITY.  LECTURES ARE REALLY ORGANIZED AND HE POSTS STUFF IN ADVANCE (USUALLY).  TESTS ARE FAIR.  HE IS AWESOME,1
"Lots of assigned reading (with notes), incredibly tough, her feed back is often delayed and gives no direction.",0
"I loved her. She is very helpful, involves the class. There is a lot of homework and reading. Homework every class. She is a very nice lady. Ready to help when needed. I would take her again and would recommend her to anyone. Plus she got our textbooks for only $9 or free online!",1
Professor Scoville is a great man with a big heart. I would have enjoyed the class more if we didn't get stuck on the small things and focused more on the larger topics.,0
This class has potential to be super boring but Pete tries to bring in outside situations that are relatable to make It interesting. If you use his office hours he is very helpful and willing to do whatever it takes to get you to pass his class because he sees the effort you put into it. Gives out extra credit. I did not use my text book oncnu,1
"Awesome teacher!! I really wasn't looking forward to the class originally, but now i can't wait to go. I love it! Web-enhanced, but its worth it. I assure you that there is not a better teacher than Chuck. The class is easy (lots of videos and slides) but worth the while.He's very funny. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!",1
"This class is an easy A but the issue is she grades your free response answers on the quizzes, tests, the 2 assignments, and 2 discussion posts with impossible expectations. She says not to plagiarize but then she COPY AND PASTES questions and its answers from the FREE ONLY TEXTBOOK (openstax - American Government 2e). PS who cites for a trivia????",0
One of the better teachers I have had yet. She goes over problems in great detail and will personally help you if you go to her. She wants to see everyone understand why things happen and not just getting the answer.,1
"Nice and semi entertaining. BUT, she is very difficult and gives hard quizzes and exams. She always says she will never do an easy quiz. If all you're taking few hours, you'll be fine. But I would not recommend taking her class unless you can put time into it. If I could do it over, I would have picked someone else. If you take her, study a lot.",0
"Also, pay attention to her previous semester's tests as she will base her exams on them, wink wink, nudge nudge ;) No way you can't get an A in her class ^__^",1
"LISTEEEEEEN, Prof. Hendrick is one professor you want to take a class with, she knows what she is doing in Basic Acting and I wish she taught upper-level acting classes as well, that's how good she is. She is one professor I am grateful to have taken a class with here at Trinity, she knows how to turn a class into a fun learning space. TAKE IT",1
"Lots of circular reasoning, and endless babbling with many useless readings.  Terrible class.  Papers are poorly explained and do not tie into class.  Do not take this class!",0
"I loved this class, I love the theories he taught, In fact I still know them. I hate the fact that his Exams are THEORY BASED though. What good theories only for engineers. What good is to memorize with very little applications. Its easy to pass his class. But hard to get A because he takes of A LOT of points for little things. Like wrong sign, -20",0
Great course. Viewed policy and social issues from intersectional perspective. Worked in groups online and my group was proud of the work. Taking the course changed my view on some social policies.,1
Really enjoyed his class! Learned a lot and honestly it wasnt even that hard. A quiz every class but he offers extra credit so youll always get a good grade! Test are pretty straight forward if you study youll pass.,1
"Probably not my favorite class but it was an easy A if you do your work on time & cite your sources properly. If you like to read and write, then take this class. However, if you don't like reading about art and history, its not your best option. I wouldn't take this class again because its too much work for an easy subject. Test are from the book.",0
I'll honestly never take a class with this professor again. She is rude and if you ever correct her so other students don't get behind from the mistake... she gets super hateful. And if you opt out of training sessions (even when she says that's ok) she will ridicule you because you didn't go if you get one thing wrong. The work load wasn't bad tho,0
"Dr. Heilman is the best professor I have ever had. Her lectures are heavy, but extremely interesting and captivating. She is SO smart and very understanding about late assignments. Literally the nicest and kindest prof I've had, the U of A is so lucky to have her.",1
"Sñr. Newall is nice and takes time to go over grammar in class. He's really straightforward about what to expect on exams. His class was my first Spanish class in college- I feel like I got more out of a high school class than I did this past semester, but he's new to USC and he did what he could with the SPAN 210 curriculum. I'd take him again.",1
"Too difficult for ENG100, *few* students got As.  Would not allow you to improve your paper's grade to show progress, instead on the next paper have you improve that criteria, but knock you down with another new one.  Endlessly talks in lecture and is ultra redundant, seems to love his own voice.  Class was *so* boring it made everyone seem dreary.",1
He is a really nice guy but his lectures can be very boring and I found myself zoning out a lot. Accounting is a boring class itself and he doesn't make it much better. There is a lot of homework that you need to do online as well.,1
"good teacher overall, kind of a pushover. doesn't care if you stroll in late and catches you up if you are. 3 hard essays, but other than that it's just activities from the textbook and occasional copy-and-paste quiz. i'd take him for a B you might work a bit for.",1
"Morris straight up didnt care about teaching this course and all he talked about was his job at iRobot. Didnt look over the lectures beforehand, and lectures were a week behind homework for most of the semester so you were learning what you needed to do the day you turned in the homework.",0
"Okay, normally college professors are bland and just assign assignments, grade them, and give help when asked. Professor Reese is completely different. He is outgoing, vibrant, and hilarious. I actually look forward going to his classes, and I never want to skip because of how entertaining he is. He is awesome and take him if you can!",1
"Somehow manages to make a simple subject (first year calc) confusing, even to the people who have taken it before in high school. All he does Is write proofs and make weird jokes. We have seen more of his hands writing out messy proofs on the projector than anything else. Just stay home and read the book.",0
His admin law class was the worst class I have ever taken. He just rambles and is all over the place. He makes a boring class worse. His quizzes and exams are hard to understand never mind pass. He tests on materials completely unrelated to the course. I bought the textbook so I could teach myself because I learned so little from him.,0
He seems to have stuck with the same processes for years and has never innovated his teaching style or class format. The homework is incredibly straight forward and actually allows you to learn. The exams are a different story. He has no questions from either the homework or workbook that prepare you for the tests. 75 percent of the grade is exams.,0
Awful prof. Condescending attitude towards students. Sometimes she messed up her lessons & was corrected by her students. MC tests were horrible. I dropped this class the day before the last drop day. The material was interesting but I don't recommend this class if she's teaching it.,0
"Dr. Nguyen was my favorite professor I've ever had! He's really the only professor in philosophy who made me read the texts, which is pretty rare in the philosophy department. He will make you work hard, but in the end, you'll know so much more than when you first walked into his class. If you truly want to learn philosophy, he's the one for you.",1
"Professor Hesford encourages students to look very critically at course texts, and does not encourage any particular line of thinking. Assignment descriptions were often unclear, but she was a surprisingly generous grader, despite being very critical when giving feedback on assignment drafts.",0
"Mrs. Lusk-Stern honestly made Psychology not all that exciting to me. It wasn't that she was a bad teacher and she is very nice and understanding, but her lectures feel useless and like they go on forever. Most of the lectures she gave only barely touched on the actual test, however she gives you very useful reviews so definitely USE them.",0
"Peevish but knowledgeable professor mainly interested in research. There are three strictly-graded essays which make up your grade. You will find absolutely no leniency in Kello regardless of the validity of your excuse, so research well, follow the rubric, and use professional writing. Lectures are very interesting, but attendance does not matter.",0
Really knows what he's talking about but much better professor for a higher level class. Tests are really hard and require you memorize the content. Lectures are pretty standard. Knows a lot about research. Definitely stop by his office because it can clarify things that were hard to understand in lecture.,1
This is my second time in college (going back for another field) and this was honestly the most difficult class I've ever taken. She gives an unreasonable amount of homework and her tests were totally unreasonable. They're all short essay questions and about 30?/test. She is a very slow grader so you don't always know where you stand grade wise.,0
Her tardiness policy is wack. She shows up to class 3-5 minutes early and expects every student to be there or do not show up at all. Multiple times students have been counted as late (then she marks off your final grade every time your late) even before class is suppose to start. She also marks you down if your cell phone is out on your desk.,0
"Although no textbook, Tons of readings. Could not finish his sentences all the time, but his sense of humor helped a little to make the class interesting, and can't forget his funny gestures. Kind of a tough grader, really have to study and put work into essays.",0
"Brilliant teacher for those who can hear him. I'm sure it's frustrating if you can't. Keep an open mind, ask questions, and really try to understand what he is getting at! You will learn as much as the openness of your mind allows.",1
"I did not enjoy him. His comments always made you feel like you were extremely lacking in knowledge. While criticism is critical to improvement, you did not receive a good grade unless you ripped someone else's piece apart, which is not productive in the least. AVOID.",0
"It's easy to get him off task, but he's a really sweet guy and I feel he truly cares about his students.",1
"This guy is pathetic. he grades very harshly, the group project is a mess and is not needed. the readings are way too difficult for a regulars English class and as the semester starts to wind down u will say why didnt I take another professor. He will make English a living hell for u . Stay away !!! Youll see",0
"She is a task master. I had her for SEYS 700 and while other students groan and complained; Ortiz is unconsciously preparing you for the real world of working in Education.  Her syllabus is specific, the reading are essential, the papers are insightful. She grades accordingly to what is asked in the assignments. It is not rocket science",1
"This class is awful. I'm sitting here now and am debating getting up and leaving. She has NO clue how to use the online system and if you don't do the homeworks (which are graded) you WILL fail. She never lets you leave early and is so unclear, for a 101 class she speaks Spanish 90% of the time. Drop this now. ",0
"Hardest, worst professor. Do not take her class if you can avoid it ",0
I never say this but Dr Gaffin is an awful Professor. I am an A student and I unfortunately will not be passing this class. Good thing i took it pass/fail. Save your time and DO NOT take this class. Tests are way too hard and he expects way to much out of his students for a 100 level class. Rambles on and on about one thing for the entire class.,0
"She was terrible! She was inconsistent, and was never focused. She would tell some nonsense story for half of the class. Also, she assigned meaningless homework assignments that were subject to change the day it was due. I disliked this class immensely.",0
STAY AWAY,0
"Solari is easily the BEST Professor I had at State. He is so animated and lively.... not to mention hilarious. Hes one of those people who just knows so many facts off the top of his head, its amazing. I adored him!",1
"Do not take his class. He does not reply to students. During the COVID happenings, he did not announce anything the last 2 months of the semester, leaving us students completely in the dark. Cancelled all remaining assignments, tests and quizzes and our final grade was determined by such little material. Very unorganized. DO. NOT. TAKE. HIS. CLASS.",0
"WORST PROFESSOR EVER! she literally does not answer her EMAILS! she is a communication professor yet her inability to get back to you with attitude is unacceptable. Her workload is insane she acts like her class is the only one, meanwhile there is other courses. too much for a 200 level class .",0
"Ken is a great person who wants the best from his students as well as himself. He is prepared for class and his teaching is clear. Its not a dry lecture class becuase of in class group work and worksheets. Ken is very helpful, making sure students are tracking with him. I highly recommend him especially if you've never taken accounting before.   ",1
This professor gives a lot of homework and is not easy on grading. If you have a holiday trip planned with the family and ask the teacher to let you do something early or later theres a zero percent chance she will accept. Make sure you practice homework questions and study hard. Does provide a lot of learning materials.,0
"He is such an easy A! Easy class confusing lectures , but if you go to recitation you will definetly pass ! Shanleigh best recitation teacher ever . I never read and I got a A ",1
"By far the worst professor I have ever had the displeasure of taking. 100% biased and disrespectful as well as unprofessional. does not care about your grade and does an inadequate job of teaching the material. He basically turned the class into a debate hall and sat back instead of teaching. His averages on every test were horrible, DOESNT TEACH.",0
Would not recommend taking his class; boring jokes about his prior jobs and his exams are pretty tricky. Make sure to do your homework cause his quizes are mostly from it(also note that he promises you 10 and at the end you only have 7 or less) and also don't expect him to give you any extra help/credit if you need it. Stay away from his class!!!!,0
"Really enjoyed the course overall. Had to come to class prepared for group discussions, but discussions end up being her talking a lot (which never bothered me). She is very nice, funny, and caring. Exams were take home and were easy to do well on if you put the time in. If you can, take her at some point while at Centre, you will not regret it!",1
"Nice guy, tries to make jokes. Lectures are essentially from the textbook. He does give helpful tips about certain strategies for problems though, so maybe have a friend who goes to class. Tests are graded fair, and you can ask him for a regrade of a problem if you think you deserve a few more points.",1
"Be prepared if you are gonna take this class with this professor. If you had any prior japanese knowledge from high school than you will be fine, BUT IF NOT, you have to do SO much extra studying and work. She is very unclear and moves way too fast, she does not go into detail with anything and gets very side track of lessons.",0
"Test material not consistent with lecture.  Not a helpful instructor.  Told the class he would curve, and then didn't.  Very poor professor.",0
"Prof. Dudley's class is hard, but it isn't really her fault. Marine bio just isn't as fun as it sounds. Attendance to class and labs is mandatory. The labs are gross. The class is easier if you do the reading. She's very intelligent and the tests reflect the lecture material. Outside field trips were boring. This class is loaded with females.",1
There is entirely too much work. I worked more in this class than any other. The material is fairly easy. Lectures teach you nothing. You learn everything from the homework. Probably 5-6 hours a week.,0
"Lectures seem to all make sense for the most part, and then somehow don't have anything to do with the tests. Plays favorites and is really rude to the people she doesn't like. Some days I can't tell if she has a bad attitude or is just really bad with people. Doesn't write her own tests, and some test questions were never covered in class?",0
"One of the best teachers at OSU, so nice and helpful!",1
There is so much i can say about this professor. to make it short and sweet i will never take him again! lectures a lot yes but cant understand him. if he makes a mistake in grading labs he will not correct them. he does not help students during class and all he does is read from a power point that students have access to. not helpful at all!,0
"Have taken 2 other classes with Mooney. If you study the slides and take notes during them, as well as read through the textbook and add to your own notes, you're golden for the exams. Have a good topic in mind for the paper, and KNOW it. She grades them hard, but is always there to help. Detail in your discussions are a chore, but are key for 5s.",1
Go to class. Her exam was way different than what I studied. Had I gone t class I would have known. Overall her exams are tough. She doesn't curve which is unfair considering hw low the averages are.,0
"I took a class with him at UFV, and I see students from SFU and KPU have the same opinion. Changing schools has not changed his teaching style. Good Luck trying to get him to respond to emails. I'm still waiting for a response from ;6 weeks ago. I would NOT recommend his class. For a first year course, he expects too much",0
Listen to his stories and don't bother reading the text.,1
"She is a very nice teacher and I think she does care about the students in her class. But she doesn't go over the material well enough in class. She always lets us out early, which to some of u might be a good thing but when u are trying to learn about managerial accounting and she keeps letting you go early all the time, well thats not too good. H",1
"I was amazed that someone could have such a large ego. He acts like he's too good for an intro to stats course, but I think he only teaches it since he gets to sell his textbook to all his students. It's a lousy textbook with many typos and every student pays $130 that goes right to his pocket",0
"The worst prof. I have ever experienced. How is it possible to be this bad at your job?He treated me with great disrespect every time I tried speaking with him and acted like he was the most important human being on earth and above everyone else. I never want to see him again since he is unfair, disrespectful to students, and arrogant.",0
"Dr. Beckman's classes are not only interesting, but extremely useful in the real world. Highly recommend the program and miss being in his classes.",1
"Literally AMAZING. Loved his class. He is super passionate about what he teaches, and it really rubs off on you. The only people that did not enjoy the class were the ones that are not into astronomy. As long as you keep up with the homework and classwork then you're guaranteed a good grade, especially since he adds a huge curve at the end :)",1
"She makes you memorize several concepts. She is not the best at explaining problems nor is she that helpful during office hours. She is not the worst choice, but is not the best.",0
"You will use every single page the book.  Make sure you are in class everyday because he goes over the chapter, but in his own words and adds even more information to be used on the written section of exams.  Exams are open book, but not quizzes.  No notes can be used on written answers either. So the things he teaches in class, you better remember",0
"One of the best and easiest classes I have ever taken. He is very knowledgeable about music and makes the class fun. Lots of the class is listening to music and watching videos and the tests and papers are really easy. The final was a music performance, but all you had to do was go up there and do something to get an A.",1
"I loved how inspirational and caring she was. She really helped me get through this class and also life. If I needed anything, all I had to do was email her or call her and she would help me with what I needed. I wish I had her for physiology next semester!!",1
"Swartz is a very good professor; however, beware at the beginning of the semester he seems like such a mean person but he is not.",1
You dont learn anything about epidemiology and he makes you write 11 page papers weekly.,0
"Not too bad of a class to fill a requirement. Get the textbook. He wrote it and it's essential when writing papers (basically helps guide you and give serious info on the topic). Lectures are boring and odd, but occasionally funny. He has a coarse and brash sense of humor. Attendance (in this course at least) is 20% of the grade.",0
"Not very clear on her directions, seems to not know a whole lot about the labs, and she gives different students different answers for the same questions asked. VERY stingy about sig. figs and digits of precision. Make sure you show up to every class and do your pre-labs. She was very nice but didn't seem confident in teaching the class.",0
Our semester completely fell apart due to COVID. How do you reach a professor who never responds and is never on campus? Dr. Wigginton does not respond to emails or voicemails. Her expectations are unclear and she enjoys taking points off for reasons not provided in advance. Just plain rude.,0
Gives you many videos and lecture that do not help. She is okay with responding to emails. But does go the extra mile so pros and cons. The textbook is useless with the work given and would not take again.,0
"The information and topics were great, but the transition online had ruined what could have been a great class and professor. The professor changed due dates, never responded to emails, and has you hanging on the edge of your seat wondering if you will pass or not with last minute grade entering. If you have a choice, don't take this class!",0
"This class was extremely confusing as there were 4 different professors for the one course (literature, art, music, history.) I like the professors as individuals don't get me wrong.. but I would NEVER take this class ever again. The lectures are extremely heavy and on boring subject matters. Quizzes every week. Felt like a condensed course.",0
THIS IS NOT A CULTURE CLASS IT IS A HISTORY CLASS. What I thought would be interesting ended up being super boring. I skipped class all the time and when I did go I never took notes because she went way to fast. Her tests are pretty easy though. Get the english version of the book if you can...that saved me in this class.,0
"This is meant to be a bio for non bio majors class. She goes way into depth and uses a textbook publishing company made powerpoint. She does what microsoft sam could, just read it outloud. Only good this she did was allow extra credit when she gave a test that was WAYYY too hard and im rather intelligent",0
"Nelly is the sweetest professor, she is very funny and loves to tell stories and always lets class out early. Tests and quizzes are simple, for compositions she grades really easily. Participation is important, it can actually have an affect on your overall grade but she makes it easy by asking questions to class frequently. ",1
"Super-great guy that wants you to shine. Easy to understand and doesn't complicate things. One of my favorite teachers. (a funny guy, too!)",1
Great professor! History was never my thing but he makes it so easy!,1
Powerpoint slides are crap.  He messes up a lot and doesnt help you at all.  Tests are deathly hard.,0
"I absolutely hated this class and the professor.  His tests are horrible and super hard.  The fact that he does not give detailed study guides doesn't help study for his tests.  If you are the type of person who does not test well, but makes up for your grade by extra credit and homework, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS.  Hated this class.",0
"Do NOT take this class. He is very inconsistent and unfair. He gives pop quizzes multiple times a week and they are very different from the tests. He assigns up to 5 worksheets for homework a night. Granted it is easy math however sometimes It is very time consuming. Overall, he thinks hes never wrong and is very hard to work with.",0
"the professor doesn't do anything. he only gave us syllabus, no lecture, no communication as in NADA. If you want to learn something, you better register to a different professor",0
"I doubt if we were in an English class because half of the all blog responses are to be in English 150 points, the final project in English 100 points, the annotated bibliography  100 points also in English. He does not respond to emails, has blank assignments which he grade at the end of the semester. Can't even speak French himself!",0
Take this class.,1
Never taken class with him but hes definitely hot,1
"Thad is great! I took him this Summer for Physiology,and he made it awesome. He doesn't waste your time with things you don't need, and is VERY clear about what he expects you to know. It's a hard class, but Thad gives you every opportunity to do well. He's got a good sense of humor, and really knows his stuff. I would highly recommend taking him!",1
As a history major I really like Professor Hanson. He is very straightforward and structured and its fairly easy to remain focused the whole class period. You will need to at least skim the assigned readings as there are a lot of pop quizzes. He's a relatively tough grader but very helpful and knowledgable.,1
"Dr. Du definitely your choice for this class! He starts tough, at least looks like, but he gives a lot curves on the exams after he found out the average is not that high. Class time is the most important personally speaking, he gives a lot using the class time. Plus review session and practice questions for each exam are must!",1
I have taken her before and was easy going so I thought to take her again for PSY 306 and i thought it would be easy since it was about designing our lives and NO. It's an annoying class and always is a lot of work honestly. in other words. not an easy A.,1
Teaches straight from the book. Doesn't write anything on the board. Not easy to take notes to refer to later. He was OK as an instructor. Glad I don't have to take anymore of his classes.,0
I felt like I was in elementary school again in Tami's class. Graded on organization (I felt like I should have the best judgement on how I decide to organize). She also moved our seats around at one point- I haven't had that happen since high school.  We had a ton to cover and very little time to do so.,0
"He is up front with the grading and you know how you will be graded. I received a 90, 98, and a 100 on the three tests and I missed two homeworks and I still received a B in his class. His homeworks are weighted so much but are so easy. Given my test scores I should have gotten an A. He doesn't teach well either. Avoid his class if you can.",0
"David is incredibley intelligent however not a good prof. Rambles, spends the first hour of lecture playing music videos, repetitive and monotone. The content has the potential to be so much more interesting. This course has really put me off from indigenous studies. However it's an easy A, attendance is not mandatory and marking is very lax.",0
This class is very lecture heavy. It is impossible to retain all the information given. Each exam is on approximately 10 units with 20 slides each. Additionally he is a very tough grader. DO NOT TAKE unless you absolutely have to.,0
Burke is great!  He is always willing to help you if you need it.  If you do the work you will go good. ,1
"During the semester I took this class, Professor Horn was sick on and off but she still made the class as easy as she could. She does take-home tests AND in-class tests, she's super forgiving about missing class periods if your reason is valid, and she's genuinely a great person and cares for her students. Great class!",1
Take this prof if you want Michael Scott as your design prof. very personal and terrible with people while also being very sensitive. Is all about manners but when he thinks you mess up resorts to calling you things like dude and questions your intelligence over not understanding his often STRANGE assignments. Also judges you outside of arch.,0
"Professor Zimmer is a pretty laid back person. But it can be really hard to get an A if you are not good at drawing. When I entered his drawing 100 class I had no experience, therefore, I struggled to get A's on projects. Although Prof. Zimmer gives good feedback, when you ask for help he may draw on your paper and is not very clear.",0
"If you want to pass, avoid at all costs. Plays favorites big time, and will not help students he does not like for whatever reason.",0
"I was terrified of theory but she made it so easy.  online, open note tests. doesn't post the notes on blackboard. you have to go to class but she keeps it interesting.  breaks down the writing so that it is much easier.  extremely helpful if you need it. need the book. ",1
"Sharon London makes her acting class a lot of fun and everyone in your class will become close with each other. Warning: you have to be willing to make a complete fool of yourself and not care what anyone thinks. If you engage completely in every activity, you'll do fine and the time will pass by quickly. ",1
"Even though he has 40+ years of experience he is the worst teacher I have ever had.  He goes too fast, doesn't care if you get it or not, is demeaning, and DOES NOT know the definition of a teacher.  He is one who thinks just because he gets it everyone should.  I had to practically beg him to explain (teach) me.  I hated going and cried A LOT!",0
"Milena is the worst Professor Ive ever had in my life, she always make to find the things in the books to give the students. Fired her!",0
"I thought this class was going to be like a Calculus class I took in high school, but no. Professor Gupta truly is the worst teacher I have ever had as he never provided any reasoning for grades and even though I went to all the classes and his office hours, still did not do great on midterm or final. RIP to whoever has to take him next year.",0
"She is very tough on papers. She gives good feedback, but it is mostly little things that she gets you for. I rarely got anything less than A's last semesters english class, but I got a C on the big paper. I've had others honestly tell me what they think and I have been told it wasn't a C paper... She is sweet and definitely not boring! :)",1
Motivated and smart instructor,1
"Her class is wicked hard and the lectures outlines are all online. However, you do need to attend class as she takes attendance often.  Her voice is very soft at times and it will lose you. You will have three tests one paper and a final. The tests and finals are easy to fake, the paper is tougher to fake. Spelling counts on everything that you do!",0
She is terrible!I don't know what these other people are saying when they say she is willing to help because she doesn't at all!I was nothing but polite to her and she refuses to asnwer any questions without telling me to look it up myself or make me feel like an idiot.Teachers are supposed to help and guide you not tell you to look it up yourself!,0
She is an excellent teacher. She give fair grades and give interesting assignment to do. She is the best teacher you could ask for.,1
"Professor Bonner is an awesome math teacher, one of the best Ive ever had. He lays everything out on day one, from expectations to his grading criteria. He also had a reasonable amount of work, which allowed me to juggle my full load without being overwhelmed. If I was ever lost, he was always available and responded within minutes to each email.",1
"Professor Hinshaw is a genius!! He knows so much nformation, he can answer everything and give examples of studies for EVERYTHING! The midterms are tough since there is so much material, he expects a lot but he's an awesome professor!!",1
"No lectures, just forced to go into labs where you just copy what the TA shows you without really being taught what to do. Then you are given assignments that say can take up to 10 hours to complete in the syllabus, with almost no instruction on what to do. Grading takes way too long, one day left in sem. and I still don't know what my grade is.",0
I have this class as a requirement and is hard she gives lots to study over the weeks and when you try to contact her she misses you or not respond. I wouldn't take her at all get another class people. Most of the work is online but if you don't pass the test in person forget it.,0
Sectional Anatomy: Hard course. Too much information. If you have not taken A&P 1 and 2 just before taking this course... like a semester prior then do not take her. (Make sure you read the reviews for YOUR specific course),0
I had her for Summer 1 and she's just a really nice teacher. Even though it was fast paced I got a C even though I really hoped for a B..Anyways I'd recommend her because I understood math more with her than any if the others I had...It was less confusing with her...,1
"Had Lim for 4 classes, he was my only option for each. I consider him to be the worst professor I had at any point in my college career. I did not receive good feedback on questions I asked. Graded homework did not give feedback. Only benefit seemed to be that many students quit trying, while I did try, leading to me having decent grades. Terrible!",0
"Professor Connor was great. She gave extensions on things for some students which she passed to the whole class. 2 proctored grades- a test and the final, and note cards were permitted for both. Everything else was online with two attempts for each test. Homework is unlimited and I loved the textbook. Very interactive. I wish she did MGF 1107!",1
"Perkins was my favorite professor at Sam! His class is so easy as long as you go, pay attention and do the work. Textbook is not really he needed. He is a very good teacher and always tries to make sure you understand the material",1
Doug is a hard worker and incredible person. He wants to give you every opportunity to succeed and genuinely cares about who he's instructing. 10/10 would recommend.,1
"She is a great professor! Really funny and crass sometimes, but she knows a lot about the subject. The material was somewhat challenging, but in a good way. If you go to class and take the time to understand what's taught, you should be fine. They try to give you extra easy grades to help you",1
"Be attentive, read all assignments, answer all points, do discussion posts by extra credit deadline, use GroupMe app for group interaction, be organized. Its tough but doable. His feedback is excellent. Assignments are clear. Great professor & supportive. You put in the work, you get the grade. 21 extra credit points. Fun & interesting class.",1
"Dr. Kahn does not need to be teaching classes. She obviously has too much going on to be an effective professor. She will not respond to your messages no matter how urgent, she takes at least 3 weeks to grade online exams, and never gets through more than one slide of the material. She lets students be distracting for participation points. Awful",0
"NOT a fun course to take. The material is interesting. I like the narrative format of the online discussion questions. He is a HARD marker. You have to somehow know exactly what he wants to hear otherwise it is wrong. Multiple choice is written to confuse, not prove your knowledge. Felt like he was on an intellectual power trip with grading.",1
"Messes up the problems he's supposed to be teaching nearly every class, literally emails us the correct information after the class, you know where we're supposed to learn the material. Attendance isn't mandatory if you have someone else sign you in on the attendance sheet. It's literally easier to learn everything while doing your homework.",0
"Russell certainly cares about her students, but doesn't know much and lets her political bias seep into her classes. She called all Republicans ""Confederates,"" for instance, and when asked question about Shinzo Abe admitted she had never heard of him. She often got distracted in lectures, showing more Game of Thrones videos than actual material.",0
The term paper is heavy for the grade.  The syllabus was clear.  Weekly writing assignments for the grade is critical.,1
"Way too much work for a 3 unit class. Discussion posts every week, 1 original post 2 replies. On top of that, you have MyBComm Lab assignments and assignments from the book like once a week. Easy, but just need to be on top of it. The tests are kind of hard, just need to read. 1 major project end of class, multiple parts such as ppt & presentation.",1
"He is very strict on attendance. Clear grading . He prepares you well for test/quizzes. However, the class was boring",1
she is one of the best teachers from suffolk.She is really helpfull.whatever she reviews and tell is always on tests. if u study and pay attention in class you will earn the best grade. she is always willing to help her students.I took her for spring 2012 smester and i got an A. I highly recomend taking her. good luck,1
I gave him a good review earlier but now that I am in 122 I see that he did not do the subject justice. I am completely unprepared for this class and its only the first week. Please take a better teacher if you need to go on in chemistry. 121 is the foundation for the rest and I feel totally lost thanks to the poor teaching of professor Heske.,0
"His lectures are confusing- he is really nice and passionate about the subject, but he is terrible at specifying what is important and what you need to take away with each point. he rushes over examples that would be helpful and his slides are so unorganized, you leave lecture confused not knowing what the take away was supposed to be.",0
She's awesome! Very approachable! She grades essays really easy. We played a lot of games! She makes everything fun and interesting!,1
I took this class online. She didnt write the lectures or the quizzes/tests and that fact alone is absolutely ridiculous. I emailed her several times throughout the course to understand trick questions and she would say that the concept had been taken out or it WAS a weird question and still wouldnt give credit. Too tedious.,0
I really think the Dr. Hill is a great professor. She really cares about her students success and has a great attitude and outlook. Her teaching style is also awesome as she reviews everything before testing that we need to know.,1
"Very nice guy but too laid back, doesnt teach a thing just plays boring movies that arent tested. midterm composed nearly entirely of study questions at the end of each textbook chapter (easy if you study).  must teach yourself everything from the book as there's no lecutures or notes",0
Assignments are mysterious. Grading is unfair. This professor is one of the worst I have ever had!,0
"His class covered the most basic grammar, and then he grades ridiculously hard on papers. Lots of threats at students, not a likable person at all. I learned absolutely nothing, and I went to every class. I wish I had skipped them all or not taken the class. His only advice is to use Grammarly or the writing center instead of actually helping.",0
Great - I love her!,1
"Professor Shea is a nice person, however he teaches his classes at a very fast pace which is unhelpful to the students who are not good at math. Some days keeping up was relatively manageable to do. Other days I would have been better off trying to understand the principles of quantum physics. I would have been better off with another professor.",1
"Class is interesting, and tests are easy if you study your notes and read the recommended textbook.",1
Lives in another world where students are only taking his class and only his class. 2 different kinds of hws + 2 group projects with same group+ 1 individual project+ TSQL textbook that is dense+ he can't teach. Wait until you have senior status and take Obrenic or Levitt.,0
"Is angry before the class even starts. Yells every word for no reason. Takes enjoy in humiliating you in front of the class and loves to make you feel stupid. Ive been taking classes for a couple years and Ive never had a professor so inappropriate, rude, and condescending.",0
"If you are looking for a professor that will inspire you and make you believe in yourself, do not take her course. Dr. Wilson does not present confidence in the material, is a moving target for assignments, and treats her students as delinquent HS freshmen. Spends too much time on powerpoint slides, you're better off reading at home. Bored nightly.",0
"This is the single worst class I've attended at JHU, virtually or otherwise. Here is everything you need to know. In response to COVID, the professors chose to make this class asynchronous. This is useful for reviewing material. However, the problem that arises when you have an asynchronous class with no grades other than exams, is that students",0
"Dr. Avila was amazing. From day 1 she made it so that everyone became friends before the first class ended. we had 4 chapter exams and 1 final. about 4 or 5 lab reports (2 typed) and my class had 15 quizzes that were either ... group, individual, entire class participation. she drops like 4-5 quizzes, gives tons of extra credit!! love her",1
"I don't know if online isn't his thing, but he really dropped the ball this semester. Everything from lectures to hw resources posted late enough to not be useful, or not at all. On top of that he doesn't let you show work on exams. Makes our lives harder to make his easy. Avoid.",0
"He is very good pro,  everyone should get A . Try his class",1
"How this woman teaches is beyond me. Knows the material but is completely useless attempting to convey the knowledge to students. Reads off slides (info directly from book; created by TA) entire class. Takes attendance. Homework is meaningless so long as you make an attempt as she doesn't check it. Do the HW, know review sheet, get a good grade.",0
"I'm very passionate about the environment, engage in local activism and love to learn. This course is dry and boring. He calls ppl out to answer questions, doesn't engage - instead rambles about own experience and work. I think he is okay as a prof but doesn't leave you inspired or interested. readings are easy, graded by many assignments +exam",0
He seems like a fair professor if you take his class in person but his online online class is completely different. The professor is completely unreasonable and grade on grammar and not necessarily substance. He provide very little feedback with online courses and therefore you may not know the quality of your responses until the final essay.,0
"His class was the best online class I've ever had and I've taken alot. You do have to do the work but his grading is very fair. Even though it is an online class, he is friendly and gives you feedback on your work which I appreciated. He did have different due dates for assignments but it never changed which was nice.",1
"Unless you enjoy terrible teachers, do not take Dr. O'Gorman's class.  He is as liberal as they come, and he thinks that everyone is a political science major (and he grades accordingly).  I can honestly say that he is the worst professor I have ever had.",0
McGurr is boring but pretty straight-forward with regards to exams and homework. Gives good study guides and extremely helpful homework sessions.,1
"Dr. Napolitano was a great professor to have. Although his tests were hard, he really teaches the material very well. The background that you need for this class is very poorly taught and he makes sure we strengthen the fundamentals. A lot of deep level learning.",1
Overall a easy class if you can figure out how do everything on your own.She does not explain assignments clearly at all and becomes off topic in class. Just not well structured at all. I believe she can do a better job if she tried. A very boring class on top of that.,0
By far the worst class Ive ever taken. Never knew someone could make such an interesting class so INCREDIBLY boring. DONT TAKE!!!! The test are insanely hard and contain to broad of questions. Hes way too smart to bring it down to the level of his INTRO students. Awful experience. Had to grind hard! Hopefully I get a B! Smh,0
Professor Graziano is one of the nicest Professors at Seton Hall. As long as you do the case write ups and study for the tests you'll do great. He has a ton of business experience and gives great feedback. Definitely recommend Graz.,1
"Andre Turcotte is hands down the worst prof in the communications department. His content for SPSS is beyond advanced for our knowledge, and he does nothing to help the class understand the maze that is SPSS. In fact, he loves to leave early and leave it up to his TA's to answer 57 questions from a class of 150. Pray that you have Brady as a TA.",0
I thought I was not going to pass the class b/c she's a tough grader. But she knows that she is a tough grader so she gives a LOT of extra credit opportunities to make up for it. I had a constant C throughout the quarter until I turned in my portfolio. Passed the class w/4.0. Advice: ask questions when in doubt & buy the textbook & don't be lazy!!!,1
"I took EDUC 2110E as an online class for the summer. It is only a month long so it is very fast paced. Overall, I enjoyed the course. It is very important to read the text book. If you keep on the work, it is very easy to do well in his course.",1
"If you have an 89 in the class, you will get a B instead of a B+.  I don't think that is very fair",1
"Dr. Parris is one of the easiest teachers I have ever had, you are really gonna have to try if you want to fail her class. She gives so much extra credit and the tests are online with all the answers in the textbook.",1
Awesome professor! Helped me actually understand the concepts of cal 1 and I'm now taking him for cal 2,1
I constantly had to email him to check and change the grades because of mistakes. Responses I got back felt sarcastic and made me feel like I was annoying him for emailing. I will not be taking another course from him again.,0
"Excellent instructor, works with you, - answers your questions clearly, casual, one of the best in the CompSci depart at IRSC.",1
"Best professor I've ever taken! I took him for Design 1 and I learned so much. He gives great feedback, you just have to put in the work. You have to participate in class, make sure to read the assigned readings. Out of the 15 weeks of class, two of them I didn't have an extreme amount of homework. His lectures were AMAZING and he's very caring.",1
"This teacher loved lecturing, the problem was she had such a thick accent I absolutely had to drop the class. I could understand maybe 20% of what was said on a good day.",0
"Michael Perez is the best for COM 221 (Technical Report Writing). Mr. Perez helped me with my long research paper and gave many great advices on how to make the paper good. Overall, in order to pass COM 221 is to have a topic you like doing research on. I would really want Perez again for another class. If you have him, he will really help you",1
"Easy A, but if you actually want to be challenged (or not hear the same story told the exact same way thirty times in two semesters) take someone else.",0
"This class was for academic probation. She teaches one class a semester, and is absolutely phenominal. I've developed a relationship with her outside of class as well as in, and she doesn't yell at you. She grades everything easy. Out of 500 points, I have 499 for the semester. Take her over anyone.",1
Best prof. i've had here. Credible and passionate about his subject.,1
"Terrible feedback. Tough grader. Choices in reading are okay, but she tries to make you think HER way, not critically. It's only HER interpretation & you have to guess. Makes a class that could be great miserable. Contradicts herself; is all over the place with the syllabus. Take this class with another professor! Not worth the aggravation.",0
Dave Orso Rocks! Very easy instructor. Hes younger so he relates to students. His lectures are very interesting and very helpful. He knows his stuff! I highly Recommend him!!!,1
Very interesting class. She's funny and a pretty easy grader. ,1
DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR UNLESS YOU WANT TO GET A BAD GRADE. EXTREMELY TOUGH GRADER. VERY HARD TO GET AN A IN HIS CLASS. SIGN UP FOR ANOTHER PROFESSOR.,0
Professor Huerta was super kind and caring and I loved her. Her class does require a lot of time and effort because of the labs and module projects but they are not too difficult. There are a lot of readings but show up to class and they are all discussed. Would def take her again she gives many extra credit opportunities and wants you to pass.,1
Hardest class I have ever taken.,0
"Here's a Professor who really knows her stuff. If you're looking for quality this is it. I've always been a fan of history but the teachers always bored me, not her. Get ready to read, online resources also help. Quizzes weekly. Group/individual projects. Tests are essay style. Take good notes. Read, pay attention in class, and participate!",1
"The teacher does not do any teaching and relies on the textbook. Obviously a textbook is beneficial but especially for a 317 class, it is difficult to grasp these complex ideas without the input from your professor.",0
She blew off the students questions and told us not to bother going to the tutor,0
"Dr Souaiaia is really knowledgable and friendly. He is accessible at office hours. I look up to him. Make sure to go to lecture! You can't find answers online. Discussions aren't really helpful, which I hope will be improved in the future. I also wish we could get a schedule of lecture topics and dates in the syllabus.",1
Professor Jones was extremely organized which made it easy to succeed in class. He shows what is due every week and what is due the next week along with the points each week is worth. If you do your work you will get an A in the class. He also shoes you every week in the grade book what your rank is amongst his 100 students which makes it fun work.,1
"This class was very straightforward and easy. We had to purchase an online textbook that had the course system build in. We had a discussion every week based on the chapter we read in the book. We had a test every 4 chapters we read. Overall, the class was very easy and informational.",1
READ the textbook before each lecture. You'll get like 2hrs of online hw a week but they are great grade boosters and get you ready for the exams. The midterm and final are multiple choice and are much harder than her other two written tests. Overall she really knows her stuff and how to teach it. Go to class and build a relationship with her.,1
"I don't hate many people. BUT I HATE THIS PROFESSOR! She is condescending, rude, conflict specific and incredibly uncompromisable. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. She is unfair with her grading, will not accommodate for sick days or family deaths   I'm a white male. one time she said to me, ""People like you need to realize they can't get their way"". wow. ",0
So Molly is my advisor and one of my favorite people that I have met at UT. Very caring and helpful. She is also a PhD student and is busy.,1
"Dr. Love is an excellent professor. He explains things well, is approachable outside class, and truly cares about his students. I had no idea what to expect from this course but I found it very interesting and fun! Dr. Love is very enthusiastic about his work and loves when students ask questions.",1
"I do not why MAE dept kept Mook in this department. He basically refuse to provide bare minimum of the content of the course. On top that Mae 340 is a diffcult course. He literally recorded audio for this calculation heavy courses. It is a calculation heavy course, we need to see the math/calculation or order to understand the concepts.",0
"In my opinion, she is a very caring teacher and is very good at teaching the material. She would have live weekly sessions where she would go over the chapter and would explain the material that we should know from the test. I did feel her tests were challenging and to get an A on the tests seemed hard. Her labs seemed pretty simple.",1
"Annoying, tons of work, and rude. Hard to reach and messy, unorganized syllabus. Don't take her. -1/10 for me.",0
"The WORST Math teacher I have ever had. Highly not recommended if you want to pass the class and not destroy your GPA. Do not answer questions clearly. I felt like a prealgebra student in a Calculus class, will take points off if you skip steps that you are supposed to master. Also, imposes you how to write ( printed and not cursive).",0
"Really enjoyed his REM 445 course. He is enthusiastic, knowledgeable and breaks things down into easy to grasp bites. He is also very understanding of personal affairs and is quite reasonable and curious to requests for extensions or re-dos. The final project for this course was a doozy - start early. Graded very fairly.",1
Is the best professor at Russell Sage... hands down!! Classes are hands on and engage you in thought... Students get involved in class! Much different from most classes where all that happens is lecture with no class interaction.,1
She is very a harsh grader and rarely gives A's. However she is very nice.,0
"Andrea Milburn is by far the best professor at SDCC! She is so enthusiastic, down to earth, inspirational, and always pushes you to be your absolute best. If you are ever going through a hard time or just need someone to talk to, Andi is always there and has great feedback for anyone too! Highly recommend this professor as she goes far and beyond!",1
"The worst professor I have ever had. He does not care about the online class at all, does not answer emails or messages. Do whatever you have to do to avoid taking him.",0
"This is the second time I have taken her. She is a GREAT professor. Her rubrics are very clear. Attendance is mandatory. Don't by the textbook. Just do your assignments and follow the rubrics she gives, and you will get an A.",1
"Wasn't terrible but wasn't teaching much. Gave us a midterm, we never take notes or use a textbook so, where'd she get those questions from? Who knows. Nice, loves marine biology but isn't ready for a teaching position just yet. Project heavy but they're all about going outside exploring which was cool but not for people who have jobs AKA 98% of us",0
Arrogant but admits it. Does not give reference material. Knows his stuff. Not a fair grader. Grades your work as if you are an advanced student when you are in a beginning class. Can be rude!,0
"He is the ""BEST"" professor!",1
"I came in with huge interest in the topic and left with a better understanding of the issues and a bigger interest. outlines r super clear, blogs r weekly and not too stressful, papers r alright. Marc is a really cool prof with interesting experiences. he also hosts coffee talks at slow train for students to explore beyond topics covered in class. ",1
"Hardest class I've ever taken. Average exam grades seem to consistently be below 60%. Luckily, the discussion section counts for a large portion of our grade and you will probably do fine with the curve.",0
"I took my inquiry seminar with Professor Bullock. If you want an A, there are better options out there but it's not impossible to get an A from him. He is a very nice guy but a harsh grader who expects a lot out of the revisions if you want an A. His lectures are borningist things on earth and he has a no screen policy so the class time is a grind.",1
"MATH122 is hard enough of a class as it is, especially to teach, but if Argerami is teaching it AVOID LIKE THE PLAUGE. The content of our class never lined up with SI, and Argerami was hard to understand with the way he went about doing his examples.",0
"i'm sure i would be more engaged in the class if there was a child in my life and i had a vested interest to pay attention. the class felt disorganized, crowley just took her notes and wrote them on the board. low discussion/interaction in class, so it's very easy to fall asleep in. 3 tests, 1 essay. take for reqs, not to learn c&a dev.",0
"Extremely disappointed and upset with Cyntha's teaching/behaviour this term. Questions on tests are misleading, marking schemes are strict, and do not follow the nature of the question asked. Rude on class forums, over email, and in person. Extremely unprofessional, and makes people feel degraded with how sarcastic, unhelpful, and mean she is.",0
"This was by far the best class I took in my 1st year of University. There are no papers, 3 midterms and a final which is not cumulative and the same length as the mid terms (about a page). There is no textbook, what little you have to read will be put up on URCourses. I would recommend this class to 1st years and people looking for a low workload.",1
"He's horrible, he pretends to want to help you, but at the end of the day he kills your grade with ridiculously harsh grading on  everything. Worst part is hes the only one who teaches the class. HSC department can condemn you to this class but can't help you with anything, no tutor for SPSS, no tutor for this course. Horrible",0
"He does not know how to teach. His classes consist of reading off power points with minimal information. He will ask if you have questions, but will provide a sarcastic answer if you are not right. Constantly belittles people. Avoid at all costs.",0
"Although hard to understand the accent, I think it's almost a strength in English studies because it forces you out of your comfort zone when it comes to interacting with 2nd language English speakers and forces you to carefully pay attention.  Once you get past that she has a lot of insight to provide to analyzing the structures that govern life.",1
"The papers are graded weeks after they're turned in. This is very bothersome because you don't get feedback on your mistakes until after you've turned in ANOTHER paper. Also, I'm two days away from the classes closing and I'm waiting for 3 papers to be graded AND the final to be graded. Also, no help. Read, quiz, exam, paper, repeat.",0
"HORRIBLE TEACHER: Does not get back to your questions, any question you have you have to post it on the ""discussion board"" in front of the WHOLE class. HARD grader, how the hell can you fail a computer class? (I am very tech savy even) This guy is a joke",0
"I love Barbara Wilson! She's very knowledgeable, extremely polite, caring, and thoughtful, and tells great stories. I wish I had her for 111, and wish I could take her for 113.",1
"He is great. I have never gotten tired in his class, but it is almost impossible to get an A. Very Hard grader but you learn alot",1
Her course was like taking a course with your mom as a teacher.,1
Absolutely an amazing teacher. Scared me at first but she is very knowledgeable and with the times. She shares her past cases with us and tells us if she won or lost and how she argued. She is so caring and a tough marker because she knows her stuff. Definitely would take again!,1
Outstanding in class and out,1
"Very easy class the only thing you need to worried about is the quizzes, the two mid terms, and the paper which is easy. For the quizzes I would highly suggest you bring some type of voice recorder  because when he goes over the quiz the class before, he talks kind of fast...but its a pretty easy class.",1
Very hard to understand. And moves very fast. She tries to cram a week worth in one class.,0
Karen is a great professor. She is always willing to help out when I have questions and she keeps chemistry fun! It's a lot of work but if you are willing to put in the effort you will get a good grade. Best professor I have ever had!,1
"I took him fall 2019 and he was an absolute nightmare. I tried reaching myself from the book like i did with him for orgo 1 but couldnt. Not clear test grading it has nothing to do with lectures/hw, basically you are never prepared. I retook it again this semester with Dr. Proulx and got an A+ if that says anything about him vs a good prof.",0
Great teacher! She can come off as strict but it is only for your benefit. Do your homework and you will do fine. She helps with anything you need. Also answers emails promptly. ,1
Most of the work is stuff not really covered while in the class. He assigned a paper on a subject he never lectured on but is touched on in his online notes.,1
Stunning & electrifying lectures.,1
Tough class but she was helpful and fun.Gave lots of opportunities to improve grades. She wasn't always clear though. TA took forever to return papers.,1
Her elegance and poise is only matched by her classy style. She's really nice and well organized. Hands down the fastest marker i've had. she's tough and doesn't tolerate nonsense but if you're on the ball and know your stuff she is a joy to have as a teacher.,1
He has a very strong accent and talks very fast. This makes it very difficult to figure out what he is saying. His hand writing is terribly sloppy too. He does not even try to write neatly. He also often uses dried out white board markers and is rude if you ask him to switch markers. In general he can be quite rude and insensitive. No feedback too.,0
I really dislike having him as a prof. He gives way too many homework problems that are doing the same things over and over again. He doesn't show up for meetings with students and isn't very approachable and helpful. I wouldn't recommend taking a class with him in the near future or ever.,0
"she is the nicest poerson ever, so helpfull she will even walk you through your first scholarship and help plan out your school plan",1
"Professor Freed is an eloquent speaker. Everything that comes out of her mouth is valuable and inspirational. I would highly recommend her for someone who is seeking a quality education. My only complaint about her was that her expectations were hard to gauge. Coupled with her tough grading style, this made for a sometimes disappointing experience.",1
Felizzi is the best professor I have had at MU. He is a fair grader and takes an interest in getting to know his students. He is very personable and always found time to answer my questions or help with providing useful feedback on my papers. If you have the opportunity to take him do it. You will be glad you did.,1
"VERY RUDE, Does not speak clear (very heavy Russian accent). She always follows her OLD EDITION book. Book is EXPENSIVE!!!",0
"Mr. Jackson is a great instructor. He explains and goes over many math problem examples, that students request when they don't understand a homework or lecture. Very patient and gives extra credit,if, you complete a practice test. He will give partial credit in on a test question if it seems reasonable. HIGHLY RECOMMEND HIM !!!",1
Great prof. Super chill. Uses an iclicker for class so attendance is mandatory unless you want the 10% weight shifted to your final. Exams are reasonable - a lot of the questions are from the ones he does in class.,1
"This professor in my opinion had to be one of the nicest and caring people I have met. He continued to be helpful throughout the year and made it his duty to teach important math concepts instead of just the test. I have taken calculus before, but I gained a much greater knowledge than I could have imagined. He is also very helpful in office hours.",1
An educator should never make you feel stupid for asking a question. We are in school to learn. I found this professor to be very difficult.,0
Great class. Interesting and topical. Attendance and Participation matter - great professor. Responds quickly to email. Cares.,1
"Grading criteria is never clear. Susan has developed a bad attitude towards students and if she doesnt like you, you will know. You have to participate to get in her good books and even then, if your opinion is doesnt match hers she wont like you. She has no passion for the industry at all anymore.",0
"Great physics teacher! Has accent, but you'll get used to it quickly! The way he teaches lets you to truly understand the material. He does practice problems in class and assigns hw and make sure you pay attention because the bulk of his test come from these places. He is really helpful and wants you to do your best! Get on his side and he can help",1
Professor Noimann is not respectful. She does not respect her students and she gives no feed back on anything what so ever. I would not recommend anyone take her class shes really horrible and has no understanding. She tells you one thing and then changes up and says something else. Way too much reading and not enough time to complete work.,0
"He is all over the place when it comes to his lectures , he talks really fast and you can never read his handwriting. Its hard to keep up which him when he teaches. Never gets into any real good details in his lectures. At the end of the day, he is passionate in what he does and is a nice and caring person but it can be hard to keep up with him.",0
"her information from class will help well in preperation for teaching, she talks to you as 'boys in girls' while talking like ur in 3rd grade, very nice person though and will help you in the future if needed",1
Great guy -- he cares.  Good class,1
"Tove is awesome! I took her online intro to bus class and she was very clear and communicative. She provides great feedback and encouragement and it is super easy to do well in her class if you pay attention. I didn't open the textbook once, but her instruction was clear and easy to understand. Take her class if you can!",1
"Dr. Shahrava has a very good understanding of what he does and has the potential to be a great professor, but his lack of organization or communication makes understanding his lectures impossible. Reading the textbook will usually save you with profs like this, too bad the exam questions are pulled from concepts in his lectures and not the book.",0
"Ruder expects a lot from students, and his tests are tough. He curves the exams though so everyone ends up with good grades",1
He is not at all helpful if you don't agree about grade,0
"She's easily the nicest, most genuine woman/teacher at IU. She wants her students to do well in both her class and in everything else. She is extremely helpful, and she's legit proud of you when you do well",1
He is a good teacher and the self portraits from first vs last week of class showed a lot of improvement however the quiz of the names of the muscles and bones I found pointless and I feel like he definetly favored the people that were already good at drawing bodies. Hes a nice guy though,1
Hands down the best professor on campus. He makes class fun and he's laid back. He's very willing to help his students.,1
this class was easy for me I made 90's on all of my papers the class are long and boring but shes not very strict to when it comes to drafts and final drafts she worries more about the final paper ,1
"Pretty good professor and class. She doesn't provide much feedback when grading assignments, but other than that I have no reason not to recommend Professor Davis or her class.",1
Always seemed to be doing homework for his class. Most homework I have had in any class in my first 3 years. Considering this is a 100 level course I was not impressed.,1
"Asynchronous, does review once a week of the chapter we read(optional). Weekly quizzes (pre quiz & post lecture quiz) on Cengage. 2 midterms & 1 final, really hard tests. Professors accent is hard to understand.",1
"Almost no classroom management skills or actual teaching. While he sat at the desk grading papers, everyone just spent the period talking really loudly, playing on their phones, and leaving whenever they felt like it.  Also, Norton showed movies around 12 out of 30 days. You've been warned!!!",0
One of the worst teachers I had.  Doesn't explain much in class.  I wouldn't recommend him to anyone,0
"She is very helpfull, fair, smart. She always answers questions. I didn't know Chemistry but I learned from her a lot. She is good professor.",1
"Ms. Phillips was an OK teacher. Not horrible but not great. You can tell she has been doing this for a long time and I dont know if she cares as much as she once did. She has a real problem with time management, we were always behind. I took her class two days a week and she spent over half the time going over the previous days homework.",1
Good teacher. Cares about her students and makes sure you learn. Took her for math 110 and she helped me understand math even when I was terrible at it. Thank you!,1
"Mrs. Johnson is an incredible teacher. Her lectures are interesting and engaging. She provides numerous sources for her points throughout the class. She uses PowerPoints and often shows videos. Students are asked to participate in class, but that's part of what makes the class fun. I learned a lot about social behavior/society in her class.",1
"She's incredibly anal about grammar when grading your papers. None of my french teachers have been this picky and petty about sentence structure, yet she's an art prof. She cares more about how a paper is written rather than the content. I recommend submitting your papers in English for this class if your French isn't 100% perfect.",0
Great teacher and person,1
"By far the worst professor I've had. She showed up to her own classes unprepared and delayed papers constantly. She lost a lot of her students papers and blamed it on the students. After COVID hit, she didn't give our class a response until mid-april and gave us C's for papers she just assigned to us a few days before. I wouldn't recommend ever.",0
She gave lots of easy homework which were free points. Her lectures were very in-depth and informative. After lectures she gave practice exercises graded for effort. She is extremely knowledgeable and helpful. Because of these things her tests are challenging but you can get an easy B and a mildly hard A.,1
"Disorganized. Grading was easy if you put in the work and did the reading however her style sucks. Too many miscommunications and misunderstandings with regards to the syllabus, the group project, and everything else. Worst professor I have ever had. In a lower division course at that.",0
"Tests are only what is taught in class, just make quizlets",1
"Best teacher I ever had. All of you numb nutz that say she's not good, are idiots. You will KNOW biology when you finish her class. As for me, I'm headed to medical school because of her! Where are you going...?! heh?",1
SHE IS BY FAR THE RUDEST PROFESSOR! like why be a professor if your going to have that rude look on your face when students seek for help. I highly don't recommend this professor,0
Class is interesting . I only missed one class. My attendance grade took a crazy hit all because my phone was on my desk. The TA Keely doesn't give the benefit of the doubt or hear you out. I did well on all four test and ended up getting a grade lower than all my test scores. Absolutely ridiculous how attendance is weighted like a test and faulty,1
"LAURA BOTTOMLEY IS THE MOST HELPFUL, KIND, AND EDUCATED PROFESSOR IN ENGIEERING.  NCSU is extremely lucky to have her.  Gives the best guidance and advice.  SHOUT OUT TO DR. BOTTOMLEY, SHE DA REAL MVP!!!!",1
It seems like he doesn't care about his students and only cares about getting the basics of biology taught. Horrible jokes,0
"Professor Lee does have extremely challenging tests in terms of the way questions are worded especially for a 101 class. However, he does have multiple and I mean multiple chances for extra credit if you apply yourself. He is a jolly teacher and is passionate about teaching. The only hard part of this class is the tests.",1
Honestly the worst teacher I have ever had. She drags on everything we do. I would never recommend taking her. Incoming freshman beware she is heartless.,0
I hated this class. I took this while also taking 300 level english classes for my major and this class was by far the hardest. She assigns way too much work and expects way too much for a 100 level class. Attendance is mandatory and class is dull and useless. I don't recommend her at all.,0
"Taking this class made me rethink my minor in Spanish. Not sure what it was about Professor Wilmore, but I was not engaged in class, felt little desire to attend, which is an issue for language learning. Instructions for certain assignments were unclear, and assignment schedule was weird. Calls exams projects which misled me about how to prepare.",0
needs help with online classes,0
"If you don't know how to draw, DO NOT TAKE HIM! In drawing 1, he was expecting photo-realistic drawings our 2nd week. He likes to critique viciously without us knowing the proper techniques for how to fix them. I've never seen him draw anything. He told us to drop the class if it wasn't our favorite, he's apparently never heard of student loans.",0
"Incredibly boring. I feel bad because she seems like a nice lady and she has an extremely good memory. She's very patient and always seems happy. Even the final was open book, answers come straight out of the text. The papers she assigns are kinda ridiculous, but again very easy.",1
"Great teacher. Great lady. Going to her class literally makes my day. She is knowledgeable in her field and is very good at sharing that knowledge. I could not recommend her more highly. Not an easy A, but she is kind and fair.",1
"Welcome to frustrating guess class, you will not understand about macro and he doesn't care, also he can not explain, however, he is a good person but not a good teacher. He should be working on his accent as well. As Economic major student I am not referring this class in any circumstances if you registered to thisbe prepared for suffering",0
Handy is by far one of the best teachers in the business department.  Really helpful and understanding.  Works with ALL students.  Take her if you want to pass an accounting class!!!,1
"He literally teaches from the book. There's no point in showing up to class, your best bet if you end up with this professor is finding someone who already took Calc II and have them help you with the class. Take someone else if you can help it.",0
"She's awesome, it's a comfortable environment to really discuss interesting topics. I would take this class again in a heartbeat. She lets the students have her number and you can text her at any time and she will respond very quickly,",1
"Professor Nguyen is extremely wise and thorough with his material. Quizzes are fairly easy however the written assignments hold higher standards if you want to score a rough B or so. He is helpful and loves feedback from his students so don't be shy, especially when class participation is graded.",1
"This man is the only reason I passed math 1000. He's funny, and great at explaining the course material. He has no problem with you dropping by his office if you're having trouble. The class itself is overwhelming, but go to class, do the online assignments, ask questions, and you will pass.",1
"Listen people, this was THE BEST class I have ever taken. If you are planning on going into the medical field, this is the class for you. Your brain will be challenged daily, but it is well worth the struggle. In class, Dr. K lectures very quickly, but he will talk to you outside of class until you fully understand the lecture material! Take 341!",1
Let's be honest Robinson is a grrrreat person but a horrrible teacher. It is sad to say that someone with as much knowledge on the subject he is teaching NEVER teaches. We have to do these group projects and all this busy work which does not help you learn what Social work is. This is just a heads up take this class if your good at self learning.,0
An easy A. I did learn a lot and he is sometimes hard to understand. Overall a great class to take,1
Can tell she was very knowledgeable on the subject but had to be one of my worst professors this semester. Gave piles of work but never gave feedback or grades until the 15th week (the grades). And the final was 7 pages long over a span of 5 days! In the middle of a pandemic?! Take another Professor if you care about yourself because its a mess.,0
"DO NOT TAKE HER IF YOU WANT TO LEARN. She is super nice but when it comes to teaching, she is no help at all. Not a very hard grader on the lab reports because she does not teach anything. Lab protocols are a mess and have a lot of typos and she leaves you to deal with that by yourself. No point in asking her a question because she does not answer.",0
"he is a great prof he knows how to keep me awake in class, he is so hip and up to the times, sometimes more than me!!!! i would totally say take all his classes!!!!",1
"if you need to take a class to get back into going to school, or you just want to introduce some uncertainty, chaos and uncomfortable ""did he just say that"" moments into your day, then sign up. I took this class a year ago and I still think about it. the class itself is nearly intolerable but the spectacle is sublime. get ready for the ruckus.",0
My friend had her for a dif class and said it was amazing. This class was NOT it. She is SO nice but her grading is tough. The one pagers are 1.5 spaced. A lot of history. She seems to be a prof that thinks a B is an amazing grade. I would take her for a different course (aka the good reviews) but I unfortunately did not enjoy this one.,1
"I get really good grades, but this class was extremely hard. Her lectures on powerpoint are not clear. She jumps around from slide to slide w/o telling you what chapter she's on. She goes very fast in lecture and it is impossible to take notes. Erases everything after talking about it. Doesn't answer emails for help. Class test avg is in 50's.",0
She is great. she will help u if u need it but u shouldn't need it if u do the HW and pay attention in class. she covers everything u need to know and no more. she will not make ur life miserable. It is an easy A if u do the Homeworks. Homeworks are on the quizzes and the quizzes are on the tests. Take her class if u can! You will not regret it!,1
"Prof made the class needlessly difficult. Started Summer A with about 200 students but by the 2-3 week half the class dropped because the exams were nothing that he told us it would be. Only saving grace is doing well in the lab. Prof was not very helpful, also seemed to get fed up when people asked too many questions.",0
"shes great, smart, funny and very challenging.",1
"If you somehow get stuck with this ""professor"", drop the course and run. She doesn't understand any question asked and will give a convoluted answer that only causes more confusion. Nothing will make sense and you'll be left to teach yourself. The homework is online, doesn't work half the time, and takes up to 10 hours to complete. Not kidding.",0
She is nice and respectful,1
"His accent is very heavy, he does not clarify what he teaches in class so get ready to teach yourself!!! he shows absolutely no enthusiasm, but he'll give you chance to make up homework if you miss it. I was extremely bored in class, he would talk and write on the board and if no one understood he'd go on to  the next problem. AVOID HIM!",0
"Avoid Mook at all cost. Where the other professors/sections curve, Mook did not. Also his class is significantly harder than the other professors to(We learn more material than them). And his lecturing style is atrocious. All he does is make terrible jokes and does no example problems. Final was insanely hard(worth 40% to). HW at timesis impossible",0
"Online class - SPENT HOURS literally on this class each week. Posts are at least 2 pages long sometimes I get a 60 sometimes I get 95, NEVER 100. 5 pg term paper, 3pg midterm and 3pg final. It's all very subjective and you never know what exactly she looking for. HORRIBLE do not take if you can avoid it!",0
"He knows something about the topic, but his angle is extremely narrow and outdated. To his credit and my amazement, though, he emphasized fundamentalism's larger history rather than merely clan Anderson's role in it.",0
Great Professor! He is so cool. Easy A as long as you do the work. Made me more interested in Mexican History. Would take him again.,1
"Professor Haley is amazing. Her lectures are very dynamic, and I find that students actually want to participate. She is very understanding towards students and gave us extra credit quizzes and due date extensions when needed. She is also very inclusive and went as far as to implement speech to text tech into her lectures.",1
"On top of her strong accent she talks extremely soft so you can understand anything she says. Her tests are easy, but  she makes you study also every piece of work in the chapters, expect to memorize at least a hundred slides before the midterm and final. Try to avoid taking this teacher at all costs",0
"DO NOT TAKE! As the poster below me said, his exams are IMPOSSIBLE. I studied a minimum of 10 hours for each exam and am struggling to hold a C. Dont bother asking him whats on the exam, he will just send the class an email listing the names of the chapters covered. He doesn't care if people fail and does little to help those struggling.",0
"Mrs. Davis is the best math instructor ever! She is very caring and wants you to do your very best! She also offers extra credit, which not many math instructors do. In addition, I took this class online and did extremely well considering the fact that I usually do not do well in math. If I had a chance to take her again I would!",1
"I absolutely loved professor Welham! He is hilarious and a rockstar of a teacher. I didn't go to class much, but I always went to his office when in need of help, and he was so willing to help. He really wants his students to learn and take away good fundamentals and easy tricks from this course. Would love to have him for all of my math classes!",1
3 open notes quizzes. Midterm and final are 3-4 essays each. Prompts are given ahead of time so you can memorize your essays. The most important thing is to write down EVERYTHING she says. Printing the slides is not enough. If you include all of the details she verbalizes on tests you'll get 10s easily. Don't get caught not reading hw. Easyish A/A-,1
She  rambles about things that are not even remotely relevant to the class. she also gives A LOT of pop quizzes about material we have not discussed yet. her power points are vague and doesnt put them up online and what she talks about is not what the power point says. i get As in all criminal justice classes that ive taken but her class i got a C,0
"Nice guy.  Gives really thorough, helpful feedback on papers. The subject matter is sort of hard to grasp, but   we watched fun movies and read alot of good books. He doesn't mind if you are quiet in class.",1
"He wastes his entire class period on trying to teach life lessons instead of teaching Chemistry. Classic Hokmabadi line, ""I'm not here to teach, I tell you what you need to look for in the book."" Very rude and condescending, he wants you in his office groveling to him.",0
"easy grader, easy A. you can revise as many times as you want. no grammar quiz , no reading, just writing",1
"We did nothing besides go over slides, very boring and they don't help at all. The exams are the hardest exams I've taken because the questions are totally out of context and not like anything on the slides or in the book.",0
His lectures are extremely well organized. His tests come directly from lecture notes (never used the book). He doesn't require any other work for the class. I enjoy this class bc it doesn't take much effort to pass. I highly recommend taking him!,1
He is challenging but understanding. Homework only requires you to read and make an effort for full credit. The quizzes on the readings are tough but he drops low grades. I felt stressed about my quiz grades and thought I was doing poorly but when I looked at my grade I was doing fine. Its the kind of class where if you try to pass.,1
"Not structured at all, But he does that on purpose. Classes are discussion you do learn a lot. No textbook just readings that you NEED to read. Really nice and laid back guy. short essay for midterm and take home final. Overall great class!",1
"It is nearly impossible to make an A in his music literature class. He is helpful outside of class, but in class he purposefully trips his students up. There is a wide range of material to learn, and you'll never know what's going to be on the test so good luck. He's a good person, but he isn't helpful in this class.",0
"Awesome teacher! No homework, no mid terms or final. 1 apa format paper due and all quizzes are open note/open book. I would take him again.",1
"She does not explain text clearly so it is understandable. Doesn't finish explinations, examples, or sentances.  Luckily she doesn't grade too hard but be prepared to read the book and teach yourself.",0
"Not a fan of professor Sikora whatsoever, terrible lecturer, not easily accessible, taught myself the whole course the textbook. However, his tests are a joke so I guess that helps.",0
"Wouldn't really recommend her as a prof, her midterms were extremely difficult. However, she does have a good marking scheme which does help you from not failing.",0
"I really dont understand all the negative reviews for Dr. Misurda. His lectures are amazing and he is passionate about the subject material. If you dont wanna learn, dont take his course. If you do wanna learn, hes the professor for you. He goes very deep into the material. Outside of class his email response time is the quickest I've ever seen.",1
do not take her.,0
"Take his class at any cost, he is such an awesome teacher.  He makes the subject matter just simple and easy.  He helps out people and very cool.  HES THE MAN!",1
"This class is surprisingly a little  difficult for a drama class. There were way to many things to do. Midterm was horrible and gave no type of review. I was confused half of the time the whole semester. Almost everyone failed badly. Attendance is mandatory. Overall, she was a good professor.",1
"Dr. SASS was amazing! I hate political science but she made the topic very interesting.  There are no tests, but you have oral quizzes.  They are very simple as long as you take notes.  Make sure you read the chapters that are assign for the week, because she always asks questions from the book.  You also need to keep up with current events!",1
"If you are an EE major, this is the professor you want for EE205.  We were all better off in EE206.",1
I LOVE Dr. Braun. I don't know what the commenter was talking about when it comes to clarity.  She gives you specific things to work on and will work with you whenever you need help. Extremely passionate and knowledgeable.  This will not be an easy A but it is worthwhile in my opinion.,1
Prof Engelke was thorough and expected greatness from her students. I felt like she expected us to know the content that she was responsible for teaching to us before she taught.  She ran hot and cold...,1
"rude, too many emails about nothing",0
Very sarcastic and rude,0
"he is really a terrible professor. His class is boring but not very difficult. However, he won't give your marks in the exam for some ridiculous reasons.",0
"Dr. R cares about her students and is passionate about teaching. The class overall was well laid out and easy to follow. I took her for an online class and the tests were online and all essays. They were slightly challenging and you had to know your information, but if you try, she is an understanding grader. She is a solid choice.",1
"Late to class, graded based on relative standing because everyone would get 40's on the exam, so you wouldn't even have a clue as to what your grade could be until after the finals are submitted. He would rant about things and lose track of time. We had a midterm a week before the final since he forgot to give one. Stay away from this professor",0
"Professor Sheridan is great at what he does. His lectures are great and allowed me to learn a lot about U.S. history. If you genuinely enjoy studying history, I would definitely recommend him. However, I struggled with his strict grading criteria, which was not expected in a lower division course.",1
Alex was one of my favorite profs so far. She is very caring and will help you if you ask. She is very accessible outside of class and will respond to your emails as fast as she can. She is easy to work with and is very outgoing. Her powerpoint lectures are fun and entertaining and she loves to have fun! Definitely recommend.,1
I took professor Bugaj's class over the summer online and loved it! Make sure you read the textbook chapters and his lecture notes and you'll do fine. Clear on expectations and offers extra credit at the end of the course. Doesn't accept late work so make sure you keep track of deadlines but I loved his class and would take more with him!,1
If you value education do NOT take her. She is awful for an undergrad student who needs this to get into the Ed program. Her grading is horrendous and unnecessarily tough. Please if you listen to anyone just hear me out. Drop her if you get her!,0
"The most accessible, funny, and caring professor I have ever had. Would stay late to help you with homework from classes he wasnt even teaching! One day when we had an assignment due the next day Professor Cobian stayed until 10:30PM in the lab helping out students as much as he could. Constant jokes and info in class keep you engaged even in 8AMs",1
"Super nice. Really wants you to learn. Read, it WILL BE on the tests. He gives you study guides with everything that will be on the test!! Final project (10 page essay) sucks. Wants you to be there on time. Easiest A. Gets boring.",1
All of her grading is very unclear and doesn't make sense even after emailing and asking for clarification. As long as you do the assignments you'll get credit but be careful with instructions. Easy class for the most part but difficult teacher to get along with. She could use some communication classes of her own.,0
"Horrible teacher. I spent most of my time trying to ignore his class lecture due to his confusing explanations, illegible handwriting, frequent mistakes(even on test answers), and constant tangential references. The book he chose is mediocre. His tests problems do not relate to the book or the material that he teaches in class. Find another prof.",0
"This class is all reading. There is a 3 question quiz everyday based on the reading the night before and you need to be there to get the questions for it. His lectures are designed to build upon the knowledge of the last readings. I never read a single paragraph and I made a B, so do with that information what you will.",1
"Shelley just simply doesn't know how to teach. She talks to us like we're all geology majors, so she rarely defines basic things as she's talking about them. Her powerpoints are vague and she draws on them during class, so you don't have that to study unless you print them out before class and draw with her. I would avoid unless you're into geology",0
"He thinks he knows everything, he kept interrupting me when I was doing my presentation. I felt embarrassed as he kept interrupting and he I ask him a question, he wont' answer it right.",0
"People like him, but I wouldn't recommend his classes.  It's hard to study for his class because you really don't know what to study.  His tests are very difficult. he doesn't make clear what you need to know about a specific subject.  He just says ""bacteria will be on the test"" and you're really unsure what you need to know about bacteria.",1
"I thought she was an excellent professor and a genuinely nice person. She really cares about the individual students and wants you to improve. The only way you won't learn is if you skip class often. It's a speaking class, so expect to participate and you will learn.",1
"Clear grading criteria for papers but that's about all that's clear. Lectures get tangential, exams have material that was never covered, and don't hold your breath waiting for him to return papers with feedback. If you don't participate in class, he'll knock off points from your final grade (e.g., an A- will become a B+). At least he's nice.",0
"He takes this course way too seriously, the TA's are super strict on grading. I took this course simply to fulfill a summer credit and it will most likely bring my GPA down which is not what I wanted. I got a better grade in Managerial Accounting, rather than this course.",0
"Terrible. Mocked me for being shy, and when I became too anxious to attend her seminar, mocked me further. This was 4 years ago now, but other reviews indicate she hasn't changed, so I might as well throw in my 2 cents!",0
Very unclear with explanations. Teaching methods are way too fast. Does not take his time to slow down and explain material. ,0
"Lectures were extremely boring and completely one sided. She refuses to accept the opinions or statements that are different than her own. Not very approachable and kind of rude to students as well! Will never take another one of her classes again, thats for sure!",0
"DO NOT TAKE ANY OF HER CLASSES. Very disorganized, doesn't follow syllabus and is harsher on you if you don't have the same opinion as her. Although her classes are art classes, she teaches them more like history classes (I.e memorize dates, names, typical issues of the time period)  If you value your gradessanity do not take her class.",0
Professor Kuo's class was super easy. Do every assignment and study the PowerPoints he uses to lecture. I never paid attention during the lectures because they weren't very engaging but I studied the PowerPoints and was able to get good scores each time. Those that didn't do well either didn't do assignments or didn't study at all.,1
"This professor definitely plays favorites. He's primarily interested in hearing his own ideas. His goal is not to teach you how to think, but what to think. He teaches from the same lecture he's been using for over a decade. Make sure you get copies of them from older students. Avoid taking this professor. Take Crooms instead.",0
He explains things and provides good feedback,1
"She is very hard to understand. She uses powerpoint, but I think she just photocopies the pages out of the book because it is exactly the same. She doesn't explain anything and acts like she doesn't understand what you are trying to ask if you have a question. Most of the people in my class were completely lost the entire semester.",0
I thought his lectures are interesting but not mandatory if you study the powerpoints. Tests based on online quiz and lecture. MC tests were easy but you don't know what questions that are based on lectures will be in it. Some online quizzes answers can be found online but don't count on it. No curve so don't mess up on your exams.,1
"I can say that I barely learned a thing in this man's class. He talked about racism and systemic injustice for 6 classes straight and I learned more about the national news than state government. He invalidates opinions that aren't his own. If you don't want to be in an echo chamber, I'd suggest another professor.",0
"Often late or not in class. Most of semester was in-class activities then in last month had 2 group papers/presentations, 5 homework assignments, and 2 exams. No plan and not clear in directions or answering questions. Changed 20pt extra credit to 40pt regular assignment without telling us. Late grader, did get an A but do not recommend.",0
"Professor Keefe is laid back and easy. Attendance is not mandatory, but you get extra credit for showing up. I have her class from 11:00-12:20, but she often cuts lectures short and lets us go early. The only assignments outside of class are MyMathLab's (easy) and you have a week to do them (8) and worksheets (4). She's great, highly recommend.",1
"This lady does not know how to cut any slack. She wants things done precisely with no room for error every time, and she tends to set unrealistic and frustrating deadlines.",0
"Dr. Gray is the hardest teacher I have had. Her tests are nearly impossible to ace. Even if you study every day, there is no way to pass. ""A students"" are expected to skip other classes and make appointments to see her. Based on her tests and her snarky comments, she leaves her students feeling helpless, and as though they've been set up to fail.",0
DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS ONLINE OR OVER THE SUMMER. Every three days you have to read a chapter 40-50 pages long. Lots to take notes on (2-3 hours minimum) Then you have a quiz that can take up to an hour - with 25 multiple choice and 5 longer answer questions.. You have a fill in the blank exercise as well and a 1-2 page reflection for each chapter!,0
AVOID HER AT ALL COSTS,0
"Casey lectures make sense & makes math look easy. However, you have to know the material inside and out cause he'll ask you questions on not only to apply concepts but why they work in the first place. He's also very picky when you submit an answer even if it's correct. Not everyone is made for this class. Study guides guarantee 50% of the test.",0
"This instructor has only one volume when teaching, it's yelling.  There's a reason why her class is the last to fill up during registration..... Avoid taking her!",0
"Professor Richard is awesome! I took CRIJ2313 for 8 weeks and even though the syllabus has specific dates for when the exams will be available to take, he let me finish early and released my grade early due to going into labor. 4 exams, 8 discussions, 8 assignments, 1 research paper WHICH I received an easy A on! Believe me, he is an easy grader!",1
She gives a lot of reading and very long videos to watch and u have no time to do it because there is another assignment given in 3 days. She opens the assignments 3 days before. I advise you not to take this class while you are taking 3 or more other classes. She doesnt give good feedback and asking her about your grade is a waste of time.,0
"There are a good amount of readings but most of it you can learn from the discussions. Every topic is so interesting and she is amazingly knowledgeable on what she teaches. Morning lectures, unless there is a film on Monday and then you won't have morning class. I would definitely take it again, do it if you want an easy Gen Ed.",1
"I did not like the way she would talk to students. She is very rude for no particular reason. She wants things done her way, and doesn't understand that students may have a way that is easier for them to understand. If you are a type of student that needs to be interactive with the professor, I would not recommend this class.",0
"Her class is basically about passing the test. Homework is optional, but it helps if you won't do well on the test. Extra credit is available, so use it. And she talks a lot about herself and personal life. Personally, this is a self taught class. Study and use all the help you can get to grasp the concept of this course.",0
"Dr. Johnson is so reasonable, kind, and accepting. You are allowed 3 absences and then unexcused absences after that are just a few points off, out of like a thousand. Her lectures for HIUS 359 were all powerpoints online. NO TESTS! ONLY ONLINE, OPEN NOTE QUIZZES. One final paper at the end. definitely an easy A class.",1
The last comment is totally not true and the most foolish thing I've ever heard.  Kristy invests herself in her subject matter and her students.  She is smart and creative and fun.,1
Great teacher. If you pay attention and take notes during class text book may not be required. Very funny in my opionion. Splits sender in 3 terms 3 home work assignments 3 tests 3 quizzes 1 research paper with option to do more for extra credit. Last test is open book open note which was a relief. ,1
very bad teacher,0
"Easy class if you follow his rules. Make everything JUST LIKE THE OUTLINE- I cannot stress this enough. Speeches are easy; just follow the outline, careful with time, and practice. He makes the class feel very supportive. You don't have to be a good speaker to do well. The syllabus and outline examples will be your best friends. Take good notes!!",1
"The course is an easy A+ if you do the projects and quizzes. However, the prof is kind of annoying!!! Moazzam is a tough grader!! It felt like he doesn't want anyone to get more than 60 on the assignments.  Few of my classmates as well as myself had issues with his grading criteria. I wouldn't really take him again unless I have no choice!!!",1
I have been out of high school for 20 years and Math was my worst subject. Dr. Ande explained everything in good detail and would not move on til everyone was able to understand the math. She is an awesome instructor. Open to questions or concerns about grades and homework.,1
She is a great professor who works great with students its a hybrid class so you must pay good attention but an easy A.,1
This class was not what I expected. this teacher is all about journalism and he should stick with that only. MCOM 63 was about new media and all we did were videos. very disappointing class. He's helpful when one on one but very rude if its in front of the class. take a different teacher for MCOM 63,0
"Dr. O'Gorman is great. He is happy to go over course content with you if you're struggling, but he is also clear about what material will be on his exams. Pre-exam study group is a must because different people pick up different perspectives on lecture content. The one bad thing: he's terrible at responding to emails. Just go to his office.",1
Someone with such a lack of respect for American students should go home to whence they came.,0
Prof. Rico's class is an excellent intro to economics. He spent time explaining the concepts and was willing to repeat concepts that people struggled with. There are quizzes over the reading but you have multiple attempts to get the answer correct. The 8 week blended class was a good pace and as long as you do your homework you will succeed.,1
"Professor Day is a fine professor. 241 I thought was a relatively easy course, with him dropping one of the three exams in the semester. His lectures aren't always on topic, and the ZyBook textbook is a good resource. As long as you show up to the lecture and labs you will be fine.",1
"Hes a very pleasant person and seems super kind, but he does not teach the language. He follows the typical college class formula of ""you teach yourself, then come to class to just practice what you taught yourself"" and trust me, that formula doesn't work for language classes, especially 101 classes. If I manage to pass, it'll be a miracle.",0
"He is really nice but there are just so many readings with quizzes (one every week) and the lectures are so long. Don't even get me started on the assignments, they are just too complicated, more complicated than they should be. The first one is ok, the ones after that get harder. The group project is really confusing, so look out for that.",0
"This was an 8am class, but she was one of those teachers who reads the powerpoints to you. The material seems common sense, but when you get the exams, they are tricky and ask random statistical questions. The first exam average was a D that had to be curved 20 points. The worst part of the class is that you are required to take ""clicker quizzes.""",1
"Seems very nice but is not teaching any information. Do not assign lengthy homework and only talk about 5 out of 40 things learned. Should be teaching what we are reading about every week but doesnt, I have barley learned a thing in this class and I suggest if he wants students to succeed he changes his ways. Your better off teaching yourself",0
"Do not take his class. It is literally the worst. You can try as hard as you can to make your work look good, and he will still find something completely wrong with it.",0
Awesome teacher!,1
Shes full of false promises.Took her my freshman year and she wasnt being too honest about the grades she said she will give us and the grades she gave us.I dobt think she is very friendly to ethnic minorities if you know what i mean.,0
pretty good. simple work. teacher is helpful. teaches you have to use window programs. sometimes kinda difficulty if you don't know how to use a computer very well.,1
"unless you are fluent in french, don't even bother taking this class. When you show up every day, do all the homework, struggle to pass her brutal tests, only to be told you're going to fail the class...... just avoid this teacher like the plague. Lectures were useless, you have to go home and teach yourself, and the online homework is a joke.",0
"Not very helpful at all, talks down to you when you ask a question, few examples provided of what proper work should look like. Generally just not great at helping you understand.",0
boring lecture..! too long ..! attendance is mandatory ...! can't leave class until he says so.! even he has taken your attendance many more things likes this,0
The class is relatively easy. The only issue is that every grade comes from tests and is focused on auditory memory. The Professor is an easy going and nice guy.,1
"Dr. Brown , and Jason Marion is the best professor  EHS department ever have. I wish only them two will teach all the EHS classes especially the "" Vector"" class. I would definitely will pass if I take it with Dr. Brown Or Jason Marion because they will teach you clearly and they expect the result back. ",1
I took the online class because I needed only two more credits for my psychology major. She barely emails. Don't bother emailing her when you have a problem because she takes two weeks to respond back. There were two different instructions for our final project. She submitted final grade without completely grading ALL my assignments.,0
"She was Great!!! Taught to the test, gives study guides. The best summer class I could have picked.  It was a breeze if you attend class.  She is very patient, understanding and kind.",1
"Absolute worst teacher I ever had. Avoid his classes at all costs. He is rude, inconsiderate, gives no instruction on all and expects students to learn everything on their own. Spams your inbox all day with useless announcements and takes credit for work the students did themselves. Abandon all hope, ye who enroll here.",0
"Her course is simple- readings that lead to homework, which lead to tests. Lots of reading but honestly you can just just skim the reading. Tests are all short answer and extended response. Overall if you like theology, not a bad course. If not, I would recommend perhaps another course because you might just fall asleep every single day (i.e. me).",1
"Sullivan is very disorganized, things are often not graded on time and he takes a very long time to respond to e-mails, or just does not respond at all. Notes given in class are often very different from the things we are expected to read online and in the book and there is no correct way to prepare for the test, all of them have been different.",0
Very tough grader. Very rude. A lot of homework. Points are taken off if you misspell one word out of the whole assignment. Horrible experience.,0
"Not a recommended teacher. Lectures contained too much content to cover in a single class or menial, repetitive exercises for the entire time block. Attendence is recorded by clicker. If you're looking for an easy A, this'll get the job done, but there are other much better classes for the same purpose.",0
"ethics of education is sooo boring. she is very monotone and unclear. the tests are ridiculous (and i went to class and studied). the readings are ambigious and very boring. the only fun part of the class is going to teach at the school. and that's mostly bc dr. wike isn't talking. she's very smart, just boring.avoid if possible",0
A fantastic teacher. Never would have dreamed Shakespeare could be made so interesting and accessible to me.,1
He was no real help even when I specifically emailed him for assistance. This was a very frustrating and stressful class. I have no idea if it would even be better taken as a non online course.,0
I think I speak on behalf of others to say that he was the best in AJ. We miss you and hope you can come back soon.,1
If english is not your best subject she's the teacher for you. You dont need to buy the book you can just look up all the stories online. You write three papers and she will give you an A if she sees you are trying. The class can sometimes get boring but its totally worth it!,1
"The workload was ridiculous. We had multiple assignments every night between wamap and excel. Lecture was over excel only and did not cover traditional statistics methods. Wamap assignments were formatted for the traditional method that she did NOT teach. To get get help with them, you had to research on your own or go to tutoring sessions.",0
One of the best professors in the College of Business. He seems to truly care about his students.,1
"EXCELLENT. I always sucked at math, he made sense. Explains wonderfully, good pace, always stops what he's doing to answer your question RIGHT AWAY. Do the homework, take notes in class, and look over every problem given on the Test review. Amazing teacher amazing amazing amazing. This guy is awesome. Nice and awesome.",1
Great professor. You should come to classes because all the material is covered in class.,1
"Surprisingly difficult, and Prof Khalsa isn't very understanding.  Pay attention to the syllabus - we weren't allowed to miss a SINGLE class, and that gets tough after a while.  I was so excited to take this, but have ended up hating it.  Unless you're REALLY serious, I'd stay away.",0
Plagiarizes all of her tests and handouts from online sources. Google a question and the whole handout will pop right up. Conveniently she passes these off as her own. Great show of ethics there. ,0
crazy... too strict on attendance.. too much work...,0
"Really good professor. She knows the information like the back of her hand, and is able to explain it in a way that is clear and interesting. I definitely recommend taking her HIST 104 class.",1
Best professor I have had. Really cares about the students.,1
"I am an A-B student, but this class was the hardest class I've taken at UCF so far. I was not prepared for the content of this class. I would recommend this class if you have previously taken physics, ad I had not and it made it very difficult for me to pass. Every student did poorly on each test, and the curve is the only reason I passed with a D.",0
"I took him for eng 101 and 102. For 101 he was in hospital and literally only assigned to papers whole semester. If you did good on them, it was an easy A. For 102 he was a bit more challenging. Lots of essays and readings with questions. He is very hard to get a hold of, so hopefully you understand his syllabus right from the start.",1
"easy A, you have to be stupid not to pass.  shes boring but tries to make it fun. 4 essays little homework",1
"She is an average professor. As others mention, her English is not very clear and she's not very accustomed to American culture. It's not great, it's not a nightnare. She can be very strict, so don't get on her ""bad"" side.",1
"awesome. actually teaches the problems, unlike prof. henry...practices problems in class...helps if you dont understand...uses real world and simple ways to relate ur life to class so that u understand better...pay attention and participate and you'll do well (exams are departmental, but he prepares you for them really well)",1
"I love LaBelle. Her office hours are nearly always available and she makes the class engaging as possible. While her tests can be tricky (lots of essay questions and short answers), she really wants you to understand the material and has a passion for it. Overall, great teacher, would recommend.",1
Talks and talks and talks. Keeps classroom way too dark. Puts things on test that are not in any book.,0
She doesn't know how to teach. She is a tough grader. She doesn't know anything about cybercrime except anything from the book. She claims she is a lawyer but doesn't know anything about cyber laws and such. Her exams are very heavy and tough grader. She expect a group presentation and final paper,0
"A great professor. When he gives you the study guide, do every question. The test is word for word from it. Just a very nice, polite, and funny guy. I had no interest in philosophy, I just needed the credit, but I genuinely learned a lot from this class. He also has the cutest dog and I've seen him walking her around campus. Also he's hot.",1
"Awesome prof, awesome guy, very helpful... one time I couldn't make it for a review session, so he met me one on one and reviewed the stuff I had trouble with... HIS IDEA! He'll be one of your best profs if you're lucky enough to take him.",1
"plays favorites all the time; good for workshops anything else forget it she does not impart information, for example in a forms class she just assigned readings and told us to write in the form, never explained the form or anything.  If she likes you, you get an A, if not watch out!",0
This was a class that took a lot of extra work outside of class but was definitely worth it. Professor Jamie gave great feedback after every assignment or paper. There is research paper due at the end of the semester but Professor Jamie is there to ask for help. There are also quizzes at the beginning of most classes so be prepared.,1
Avoid at all cost. Very distant and disorganized.,0
"This lady was the biggest you-know-what to me, for reasons unknown. The only assignments are pieces of the ending research paper, which was nice, but if you don't get a C on the end paper, you fail the whole class (not her fault, it's policy). She made me change my topic at the last minute, after numerous meetings throughout the semester.",0
"Syllabus: 4 fifty-question multiple choice exams, 1 (optional) final. Going to lecture isn't required since all the notes are online. I didn't get much out of lectures because Lutfi seemed pretty unorganized.",0
Dr. Miller- Herringer is such a wonderful instructor. I wish I would have taken it seriously in the beginning. READ THE BOOK! Keep up with her notes and grades. There is no reason not to pass this class. There is also online weekly quizzes. Do not forget about them. ,1
"Proffesor Otrowski is a very sweet person, she always has a smile on her face and is willing to help you at any time. She gives good feedback on homewroks. She made BIO100 very simple and easy. Being a business major I did not want to take biology, but she made the lectures fun, I learned a lot. Take her if you can!",1
"He's a way cool guy. KNOW WHAT YOUR CHARACTER WANTS IN EVERY SCENE!!!! Danny is very helpfull and know's his subject, so I guess that makes him good to teach the subject. He is also very easy to talk to and recieve advice from.",1
"DO NOT TAKE HIM FOR ANYTHING! YOU CAN NOT, I REPEAT, CAN NOT UNDERSTAND HIM, AND HE IS USELESS WITH COMMUNICATION. HORRIBLE GRADING, HORRIBLE SPEECH, HORRIBLE...HORRIBLE...OH YEAH....HORRIBLE.",0
"I don't see why people don't like Professor Guetter. His stats course is a breeze -- he only really teaches how to do the work in RStudio :/. His jokes are punny and he can be self-deprecating is a good way. Overall a good person, ok lecturer. Just be ready to pay attention...",1
"Ever watch ""Scrubs?"", channel ""Dr. Cox."" Professor Brown thinks he is hilarious with his dripping sarcasm. I had rather watch TV for my entertainment and be taught for my tuition payment. His same flippant approach in his attempts to teach is what leaves students with no understanding of chemistry and their disdain for him. RUN AWAY, if assigned.",0
I am TERRIBLE at math and Bella made sure I did not fall behind and that I passed. She is definitely one of the best teachers out there.,1
Professor Bommer is an average professor at best. I barely learned anything in this class. All what we were graded on were his exams and they were quite hard. Many of the exam questions were very random and had nothing to do with his lectures. He was annoying and had a big ego. He would often talk down to students. Very boring and useless class,0
"sometimes too impulsive, expects student have a great interest in just his specialization of electrical. doesn't care much if you fail or pass; popular with his see you next year line. heavy on homework. Past questions will save your life, but try to know your stuff",0
"Although she's funny, Kate's lectures are scattered, confusing, and she expects you to know a lot before coming into class. There are a ton of assignments worth 1-10 points that feel like they're there for the sole purpose of making you feel like this class is taking over your entire life. I got more out of the lab and TAs than I did from Kate.",0
"Saralina is such an energetic and positive person, but in a very inspirational, not annoying way. She's always doing everything she can to make class fun and to brighten people's days. She made class fun to participate in, and was always available to help with assignments. However she isn't very responsive to emails so maybe try seeing her inperson",1
"I'm really dumbfounded by some of these poor reviews, Miles is by far my favorite professor at DePaul. I would highly recommend taking one of his classes. He's a great professor and I always found his classes interesting and thought provoking.",1
Dr. Thrasher knows history.,1
"AWEFUL!! I took Cultural History of Dogs and was SO excited for it.  She totally ruined it by teaching the class as though it was an impossible writing class.  If you can help it, DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS!!",0
He was extremely boring. I could barely keep my eyes open. I would try to not get him as a prof if you can pick. He is super nice just not a great teacher.,0
"He's so loud, eugh. He gives you 2 or 3 abstract assignments with no clear directions. If you're a novice Adobe user, good luck, pal! He won't go over the programs much in class, & def. won't teach you. Whenever we had class (he canceled a lot) he would just go on rants. (not useful!) Pro Tip: When he critiques, don't talk back. It can get uglyy.",0
She's a good teacher; presents complex material so that you can understand by relating it to our world.,1
Extremely inconsistent and unfair marking. Feedback that was given made no sense. Instructions for assignments were outdated. Her expectations did not align with the course syllabus. Very poorly designed course. Do not recommend to anyone. Not an Easy A by any means. Was not willing to discuss grades in person or over the phone.,0
"This woman is awesome. I don't know how she does it. Her Pilates class kicked my tail, but I can touch my toes, I can almost do the splits and I LOST WEIGHT! I am so grateful to her. She really cares about her students and she makes us laugh every class session. I always look forward to her class and I'm sad its over. Enroll quickly, fills fast",1
I've had her for several classes now and if you put in effort she'll help you in any way possible. If you care then she will and you'll more than likely make an A,1
"he is a nice guy, but his lectures always go past class time and he rambles about random things. Our class had nothing to do with english topics. It is a easy class to pass though.",0
"Professor Hoke is probably the worst professor I've had. She goes on long rants with wrong information. Psychology WAS my major but even with previous knowledge I ""walked away "" and took an incomplete instead of getting an F. Her tests are worded like riddles and usually filled with information that has not been covered. ",0
"She is very quick to get smart with you.  Her work doesnt make sense, she expects things that are sooooo stupid to be crystal clear. if you leave class early, she takes off points. No book....cant enter class.  its like high school...even worse, middle school.",0
DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. it is hard and you cant understand what he says. the class is so boring and he talks about one slide for like 15 minutes!,0
"This woman, has been the worst of my experience so far. Her tests are weighted, and are either three questions long, or 8 pages long. Her Conduct class is absolutely terrible.I had a passion for political science before taking her class and it is no longer existent. She doesn't care about her students and she gets an A++ on being a terrible advisor",0
About as useful as a dull knife. You are better off skipping class and instead have one of the tutors teach you in the math lab.,0
Hes super loud but nice. When someone asks a question he goes off in a rabbit hole but other than that hes nice. Dont sit in the front of the class otherwise you will go deaf... the tests are hard but the homework is easy. He doesnt even read it he just checks that you did it. He offers one extra credit at the end of the semester but its long.,1
"Michael is one of my favorite professors at BU. His class has made me a better speaker and writer. He'll return any assignment to you with a *ton* of feedback, but it's because he really wants to help you improve. At the same time, he's very compassionate and respects the work you put forward. He grades most harshly on grammar and spelling.",1
"Oh my GOODNESS - I just want to say that Professor Dudley was the best professor I have had. However, if you are looking for an ""easy A"" this is not the class for you. You need to show up, do your work, pay attention (this is easy because she is hilarious and a great storyteller). I got the book but really didnt use it - all info in class on PP.",1
easy A if you read and show up. didn't like her teaching style but some people do.,0
"He's a hard grader,  but really cares about his students and offers extra credit. Great person, just a hard class",1
"She is the worst. Lectures confuse more than they help. The quizzes sometimes contains things she actually said would not be on there. The lectures do not cover everything you need. Four of us work together on homework. My partner and I turn in the same exact thing as the second partnership, but they got an A and we a B. How is that even possible??",0
"Loved the Shakespeare course. The readings are lengthy and difficult to understand, at first. You'll learn how to decipher Shakespeare like a pro if you do your homework as you should. Dr. Ryner has a great personality, and a true passion for Shakespeare. If I could, I would take another class from him in a heartbeat. Tests aren't the easiest.",1
"Martin is incapable of organization, she cancels class, loses papers and does not specify due dates. It took her over 2 months to grade a single essay and did not even do it on her own time. She graded it at her desk right before calling me up to give it back. She is specific in what she grades for. You will fail if your paper is too complex.",0
"His grading is terrible, most of the people in my class are complaining already. Honestly feels like he lacks the compassion because he marks everything off even if your answers are right. I wouldn't recommend taking him.",0
"I took an online summer course with Professor Hegbloom. She seems nice enough, but none of the work I submitted was graded until there was just a few days left in the summer semester. Considering the course is only one month long, it was frustrating to have no idea how I was doing the entire time and to receive zero feedback whatsoever.",0
"I think he's funny! Lectures are boring, I would do homework from other classes. He does answer any questions you have and will go over your essays and point out your mistakes. He lets you re-write them so, that is good!",1
"Ben is a great instructor! He's knowledgeable, quirky and grades fair. I would absolutely take another one of his classes. We used My Math Lab exclusively which comes with an electronic copy of the book. I think I accessed the online book twice. I felt like there were no surprises in the class. Due dates were clear and reasonable.",1
She was by far the best math teacher Ive ever had. Is attentive to everyones questions and will answer them fully and make sure you understand the topic before moving on. Sad that she is moving away but incredible experience to have. Makes learning math fun.,1
She is really nice BUT she gives alot of reading. You need to read for her!!Tests are detailed and she assigns two textbooks so 3 to 4 chapters to read per week. She also has a 5 pg term paper which she does not mention at all but she still expects you to do it AND  a group project where you are assigned a chapter and have to present.,1
"Mrs. Romani is one of the best teachers here at CCC. I had her for several classes. She wants every student to succeed academically. She has made a positive difference in my life. I will never forget head tilt, chin lift. She saw something in me that that I didnt see in myself. I will always remember these skills. Im still in school due to her.",1
There is NO structure to her teaching style whatsoever. She is extremely vague on assignments and gives out meaningless work that have absolutely nothing to do with the course (Midnight Robber). Also completely unprofessional in the classroom with all the unnecessary profanity she used. Ive had to shorten this as much as possible due to word limit,0
"I took him for an online class, so maybe it is different in person, but all of his lectures were SO unprofessional. He said um every few words, couldn't get his thoughts out, and couldn't remember basic biological/scientific terms. If he is going to be a biology professor, it would make sense if he knew what he was teaching. Take Peterson instead.",0
"Very lenient professor & Caring. She is an EASY A Literally! There is no way anyone can fail her class, she makes it too easy for everyone. There are only 5 assignments, no textbooks, no PowerPoint, just a lecture and some articles or videos and then answering the questions for each assignment in an essay. But not as quick to respond to emails.",1
YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!!!!!!!!!!! STAY AWAY! this professor does not use canvas or know how to work technology. you have to buy 10 books and you have to read them all and write papers on them. and exams. she changes the syllabus every single class and passes out a new one. the inconsistency makes the class even more hard to follow. AVOID I promise,0
"He teaches with no structure , expecting you to remember what he says word for word. There is literally nothing to study off of. No textbook, no slides, just the words that come out of his mouth. The man is a genius, but incredibly lazy.",0
"This semester was different from the pandemic (DUH), but it really gave us a chance to see professor's true colors. Professor Draper was terrible. She didn't support us in this internship class. She added more work than she should have, given how stressful this semester was. She left me feel unsupported in this class and I would not recommend it",0
He is a great professor and really makes your use your critical thinking skills. Do not take him if you just an an easy A.,1
Was not considerate when i was out sick Even though it says redos on papers gets one week to complete she told me that I needed to have the final draft due that night as I needed to redo it. It says one week on syllabus and she said that's only after i grade it. she was making me redo it instantly and didn't follow syllabus she made so i dropped it,0
Great professor. Take him if you get the chance.,1
Very boring class. The work you do in her class has nothing to do with computers. She gets mad when you try to ask her questions DO NOT TAKE HER.  She is the worst professor i have ever had in my college career!,0
Shes cool,1
"Take this class! 1 introduction post, 4 discussion posts, and a few quizzes (10 questions) as well as a final. It was an interesting class but the structure made it more laid back and not stressful. The discussion topics were interesting and made you think. I would recommend you take this class if you need psych and the law!",1
"I love Ms Miller, most people will call her tough. College isnt easy, there are so many resources to help. She is understanding, and helps her students as much as possible. Just dont go into her class expecting to get by doing bare minimum, &that should be for any class. As far as response time, Ive always got a email the day after or night of.",1
"One of the most inconsistent professors when it comes to grading. He grades papers primarily off of quantity over quality, so if you aren't good at writing fluff, he is not the professor for you. He does not have a clear grading criteria and will often base your grade on your performance in class. If you care about your GPA, I would not recommend.",0
"Ali Asgary is an amazing professor! He is a very helpful professor and his instructions are crystal clear. Attendance is mandatory, textbook use is medium, but his course was definitley worthwhile. Ali get's an A+ for eing a damn good professor.",1
"Has a very hard time explaining concepts clearly. An inexcusable amount of typos and mistakes on power points and even exams. Really should not be teaching, she's more of a chemist than a professor. Very nice person to talk to though, lovely lady.",0
The worst class I have ever taken.,0
doctor morgan is great. his accent is awesome (i guarantee you will end up saying words like he does by the end) plus he's very helpful especially in lab. overall a really good teacher.,1
He does know his stuff in criminal justice but overall I am going to avoid taking him. Class is easy if you have the book the exams are based on them. He is just a rude person in general I did not like how he treated people unless you were a favorite of his. I'm majoring in criminal justice and thinking of going to another school.,1
"While you do not learn the material that E102 is set out to teach you, you learn so many great things you would not otherwise know. Examples: how to respectfully debate, reliable sources, and understanding different opinions. She is not about shoving information down your throat. You learn what you want out of this class. Most important, she cares.",1
She is absolutely amazing. she grade fairly and will help those who want it more then those who dont. You will learn in her class it also helps that the classes are small,1
"Dr. Phelps loves art, and it comes across in his lectures. Come prepared to take lots of notes. The information he gives you in class is what's on the test. You'll have to study for the tests but I have learned so much in his class. Don't doze off, don't skip a class, and do take notes! Art book not really necessary if you take lots of notes.",1
"Awesome, awesome, awesome teacher. She's super knowledgeable and encouraging. Just be sure to only take her classes (or any language classes, for that matter) if you are completely dedicated from day 1!",1
He is a good storyteller. I learned a lot about indigenous people. We watched a lot of movies in class.,1
"Very good, knowledgable, nice. Long readings, but are pretty helpful. Class is what you put into it.",1
"Do NOT take this professor if you do not like harsh/uncalled for feedback, lots of assignments, very little time to do each assignment, and a bad attitude towards students. She does NOT care that you have other courses she treats you like graduate students. She is so anal about APA and every detail it'll drive you insane. BEWARE OF HER AT ALL COSTS",0
he is an extremely tough grader for a level 100 class. he wont hesitate to smack you with low grades every time u have a slip up.,0
"I've had this prof many times, and each time it just gets worse. It's impossible to get office hours. Don't even try to get feedback on a paper before you submit it. His handwriting is gibberish-so feedback on assignments  and his notes on the board are scribbles. The quarter also ended last week and he hasn't posted any grades yet. He is a mess.",0
She expects entirely too much for a 101 level class. Is not very helpful and makes the learning environment stressful as she constantly puts people on the spot.,0
"He is the worse you can get in Nova. All my projects were working though I submitted late. I had 90 on all my tests. But he end up giving me less on my finals , I dont know how. And I got a B. PEOPLe who copied from me got an A. I learnt nothing the whole semester. Never take him. Its a waste of time and money",0
Dr. Ponce is an amazing woman!  She is a great counselor and cares about her students!  She will motivate and help you achieve your dreams.,1
"Very helpful, extremly knowledgeable of history, a teacher whom is passionate about her students and the work she is doing.  Honor to be in her class.",1
"Her media literacy class was very interesting. Alot of you're grade is based off papers 3 papers and 2 exams. Exams aren't too difficult, tough grader with papers though. She's very funny and can be at times very over zealous. But its very refreshing compared to alot of the boring teachers at CCSU. I strongly suggest her.",1
Nice guy.  Extremely helpful.,1
"Very rude,mean,disrespectful to student I don't know why he hasn't been reported to the art department !",0
She's amazing! Definitely understanding and extremely smart! She's definitely helped me as a student. Show up to her class it's fun! And no final (:,1
do the extra credit opportunities. It's an online class and it's her first online class. TAs vary. She is quick to respond to online inquiries. Consistent work but relatively easy course. You will learn a Lot!,1
"This teacher is the worst one I've had in the Comm Department so far. Her practice tests online are super easy and then when you get the in class quiz, they are much harder. This course is only two credits and she makes it way harder than it should be. Impossible to get an A. ",0
"Very disorganized, wastes class time on pointless things that won't be worth marks. Very non-specific about what he looks for. Goes into detail about one essay then tests you on one you have not gone over. Pointless class, taught myself more than he taught me. I always did very well in my other classes and English, I feel dumb in his class.",0
PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF YOUR OWN SAKE DON'T TAKE HIS COURSE IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO. PLEASE. ,0
"Accounting isn't an easy class, but she is a great teacher. Some people think she gives too much homework, but really she's spoon-feeding you with so much practice for the test. Tests reflect the homework exactly. If you keep up with going to class, taking notes, and doing homework, you will pass with flying colors. She is good at what she does.",1
"Overall a really great professor. I struggled a little bit on the exams, but his end of the quarter grading system evens everything out. He is funny and makes math fun to do. He will re-open hw assignments if you ask him to, class was recorded so I was able to go back and watch lectures. Very approachable professor :) ",1
"Kildea is a great professor. He is very relatable and is always willing to help inside and outside of the classroom. He does not always remember to take attendance, but just show up because the class is easy if you pay attention and participate occasionally. His syllabus is clear but he rarely follows it so always ask him in person about due dates.",1
I took him for all my accounting classes at NOVA. Loved his lectures and explanations. Since the classes are usually small he is very open to questions and will take time to help you understand. As long as you pay attention in class and do the homework the tests are incredibly easy. I would definitely recommend over all other professors.,1
"Ms. Benton is a great person and has a great sense of humor as well. However, as a professor I didn't quite enjoy her. Lectures can sometimes be all over the place and she isn't very clear on what she expects. There were some assignments I had to do multiple times and her feedback can be difficult to understand. Stay on top of things & you're fine.",0
she makes differential equations harder than it needs to be. her grading is very strict with not a ton of partial credit. the tests are very difficult to finish in the 50 minutes she gives. when you ask her questions that arent in her notes she gets confused so it seems she doesnt fully understand the material,0
Mr Ed Warr is truly a great teacher. Try not to miss any class because he sometimes give quizzes that appear in tests. Take your laboratory works seriously  and also take notes of whatever he says in class.,1
"I really liked Leah. She's sweet, accessible and extremely disability-friendly. The course goes FAST but there's not much to do with that it's just how foreign language courses are set up. There's a lot of work but she wants you to succeed and she wants you to have the tools you need. Don't be afraid to make a mistake!",1
"he is a great professor, makes the material easy to understand.",1
"She dismissed class late every day and was difficult to understand. All of the homework was online, so we received very little feedback. This is an incredibly lazy teaching method and made me less passionate about mathematics! I'm now in linear algebra and have never had a professor as awful as her.",0
"Ummm. He is a really nice guy, but not a good teacher at all. He never writes anything down or explains anything to you. He reads the book in class and expects you to attain information just by reading. Never responds to emails, and he lost my homework (he eventually found it but it was still frustrating). All in all: good person, bad teacher.",0
Awesome professor! She makes learning  fun and is always there to help her students. I recommend anyone to take one of her classes.,1
"I took this class last semester, and it was terrible. I expected to actually learn. And all I did was read the entire book. This teacher literally reads off slides and expects you to know everything on the test with a little bit of help of a study guide. I wouldn't recommend him at all. Not worth your money!!",0
"Prof Dudley is a quirky guy which makes his class interesting. His class is not mandatory but tests are solely based on lectures. Online quizzes, a few short writing assignments, and 4 exams. Not a bad class to take if you need credits or an easy A.",1
"John Rhym taught the material effectively, and slyly involved his research into the material in a way that enhanced my learning. I recommend him.",1
"There is a bit of reading (15 mins/week). Quizzes are written from readings. Speeches are easy to write and pass. Slow paced class, so there is time for other responsibilities. 3 individual speeches done in discussion section (25 ppl), one group project done in front of big lecture hall. Note sheets allowed on every quiz. No final. VERY easy A.",1
HE IS THE WORST. i would never take him again. he picks favorites. when he lecture he goes all over the place. worst teacher i ever had.,0
"Professor Hill isn't the best teacher, her class is pretty boring, but her tests are almost all of the clicker questions from class and the online quizzes. If you study and come to class, you will do fine in the course.",0
"If you're looking for an easy class or even an elective, go for this course. The content could be a bit dry and the lectures are pretty boring, but I'd say Catherine is an easy grader. I was at most of the lectures but did not engage much so participation (or just attendance) doesn't matter much either. So just do the assignments & you'll pass.",1
"Best teacher I had at this school. Very helpful, always available if you need help. Great advice for transfer students. Funny and easy-going but knows when you're bsing his work so don't! Makes class fun and willing to listen to suggestions for future material. Ran out of classes to take with him but wish I hadn't!",1
"I took Professor Mc Lawsons online PHIL 1304 class and it was super easy and straight forward. 1 quiz, 1 discussion board, and 1 reading assignment every week and then your final exam at the end.",1
"It is her first year in San Marcos. But man, do not take her class. She is unorganized, all over the place and confusing. ESPECIALLY if you have a job, she makes you go out of your local area for credit. Her test? do not know where the questions come from because there is no textbook or lectures in this class. Waste of my time and money.",0
"McKenna is by far my favorite professor. He wants his students to know about the real world and his lectures are extremely interesting. Do the papers, watch the videos, and study his review and you'll get an A.",1
"This professor was horrible as a professor, as a person he is rally great. He listens gives great advice and is there for you. However, in class all he does is goes over videos that he gets offline, It sounds like he doesn't know the material he teaches and his test are not what we discuss in class. Horrible class did not learn a thing.",0
"The midterm and final are extremely hard, also I took the hybrid course which is almost impossible. I recommend taking the actual lectures. ",0
He is an amazing prof.  He uses silly humor to help you remember concepts and it works.  He really knows his stuff and does a great job of explaining difficult concepts to someone who has never had bio before. He is such a nice guy.,1
"Review sheets and in-class quizzes do nothing to prepare you for the tests. She is a great teacher with passion for finance however her tests are insane. She expects you to know how to solve problems that you don't discuss in class. If possible, I would recommend another professor just because her tests are INCREDIBLY hard.",0
Worst professor I've ever had he is terrible at explaining and teaching the material and a product of this was literally having the class fail all the exams he gave. If you have to take analytical I pray for you as he is the only option but is terrible.,0
"He is a really nice professor! He is passionate about Physics, thus he gets excited over the topic, which is a good thing! He has a good sense of humor as well",1
"I really hope CP24 knows about this. WHAT THE HELL WAS THIS?!! I never knew a professor can be this bad. I got an A 100% because of my own hard work. What is learned in class is ""The course is called ITM 100"" PERIOD!. And whats with the rat tail?",0
"Teacher is terrible. She contradicts the information in the textbook when lecturing. She seems to not have read the book. She makes a very easy class harder than it really is. The quizzes WILL NOT prepare you for the exams. No idea where she pools the questions from or the format, but the Exams are awful, and she won't prepare you for them.",0
"Nice teacher, but make sure to join every class. She takes attendance at the beginning of class and it does affect your grades. Tests are a bit heavy for the hour given, homework is a decent amount on the textbook site. Many group breakout rooms each class along with projects. Always asks for volunteers so be ready to speak",1
"An extremely difficult professor for my particular section. This class will not receive any free pts, and he sticks to his schedule. You must attend his classes, you must read the material, and most importantly take notes.  He welcomes opinions, and be sure you come to class with a discussion from the work which was assigned.",1
"Dr. Keeling is obviously knowledgable about toys and games.. but she changed the topic of the class after registration from a topic I was interested into toys so I went from being really interested into the class to not. She is an okay grader for papers, but a lot of the class is busy work. Participate lots bc its part of your grade.",0
"There are only 2 O-chem instructors at WSU. However, it terms of difficulty, Dr. Burns' exam is more tolerable than Dr. Groutus'. Professor Burns is very knowledgeable in the subject. He uses examples on the board but does not explain the process of the reactions step-by-step. Instead, you see him keep on writing the reaction with no demonstration.",0
"She gives a review the lab before the practical. However, it is misleading because she would say certain parts would not be on the test but it ends up being on the test. She also takes points off for spelling. You are better off reading the manual. It is a hard lab for an already hard class.",0
Wow what an amazing class. Not! The longest most boring thing youll ever do. This course is like watching paint dry and you get just about as much information from both. Professor Thompson shouldve retired 20 years ago. He will mumble on forever reading power points that have nothing to do with the actual tests. failure in action.,0
He is very enthusiastic about what he teaches and he is all about the students. He gives great tips and lets you do all of your assessments in a group,1
Easy A and you learn a lot. Teacher gives good feedback and the work is not difficult. Quizlet is your best friend!,1
"I really enjoyed this class and I really liked this professor. There were huge technical issues with the learning software we were using - the computer marked correct answers as wrong, but Dr. Ikegwuonu went above and beyond to make sure that everyone got the grades they deserved and showed a lot of leeway. Very passionate and knowledgable. ",1
"She is actually one of the few UNDERrated professors in UNCC and possibly among the most articulate in her field. I disagreed with much of what she said (feminist, AA yada), but she did much to shape my thought and approach to lit. She is pretty open-minded. I wrote a paper in which I bashed an author unmercifully (but truthfully).Got an A anyway.",1
"Shes terrible. She talks in circles and barely makes any sense. She takes attendance every class so you have to go but you don't learn a single thing. She is extremely unclear about everything yet expects you to know what she is talking about, when a lot of times it seems like she doesn't know what shes talking about. Never take her classes.",0
"Loved Mr. T, very caring and offered extra help if needed. 10 quizzes, a midterm and a final. Thats all he has on the class. No papers, no projects. I also took the lab with him and it was the easiest lab i have ever partaken in. Only complaint is he would give harder questions on the midterm/final.",1
"I would highly recommend this class if you enjoy putting in quality work and do not mind getting a grade that reflects otherwise. She is a nice professor/person, but her grading is subjective. Her guidelines for essays/homework assignments are arbitrary. It is ashame that she grades in this manner because I liked the class, but became discouraged.",1
She is an amazing professor! She makes class fun and is easy going. As long as you do the work you will get an easy A. I totally recommend taking her.,1
This is a wonderful teacher with a beautiful heart .. I highly recommend her because she is very inspirational what she is doing..,1
"All the stories about him are true as this was my most traumatic academic experience. I literally had to study every day, especially when he might spring a pop quiz on us. Lectures were hard to follow, since he went too fast when using powerpoint slides. His english is incomprehensible at times (achume?). Shockingly helpful during his office hours.",0
Clas is easy if you keep up with weekly work. Lots of flexibility.,1
This guy is impossible to reason with. Avoid him at ALL costs in the math department,0
She's an excellent teacher took her class in spring and passed very easy I really recommend her for English,1
"Tests did not reflect anything that was taught in lecture, you are better off learning all the material off of YouTube. He hardly responds to emails and when he does he answers vaguely. He also emails you in the middle of tests to correct his own errors in the creation of the test. He Is not willing to work with students with questions.",0
"Def need a hard copy of the book; electronics are prohibited in class. Each class he would call on students to translate parts of the story (if you don't have the translation, then he'll let you know it's ok and go on). Quizzes are given but he'll let you know the day before. The only awful thing about this class was that it was at 7:30AM.",1
Be prepared to teach yourself MATLAB... And then be prepared for your next semester in  MAE 305 for the teachers to tell you it's not  their problem you didn't learn MATLAB in MAE 205 and not to blame the professor you had. Just telling it how it iswas for me and the majority of my peers in MAE 305 now...,0
"(COVID) taken pass/fail; felt like a dumbed down AP French class, i got a 5 and still had to take it for some reason. Personally not a great exp. w her, she was pretty rude and inconsiderate about absences when I was sick with COVID and other. Too many pointless grammar tests which made me feel dumb and WAYYY too much homework for an online class",0
"the field trips were excellent, However i think he is becoming senile and forgets what he said and expects you to remember it for him and the test. Very critical of any work you do which is horrible. Good on field trips, horrible in grading",1
"This class was terrible. He gives no instructions and just expects you to figure out what is due. He is extremely unorganized and never knows what he is suppose to be doing. For the final paper we had to write a research paper based on a group ""project"". We were not given a rubric or any instructions on what exactly he was looking for. Don't take.",0
"Antonie is an English teacher at heart so his classes revolve around essay writing. He struggles to make the content relatable and interesting. The quizzes were open book but very tricky and concepts from the text were rarely discussed in class. If you need an engaged environment, this class is not for you. If you need dry and boring, hes your guy",0
Worst Professor I have ever taken. When you ask for help he belittles you. It is not in the syllabus but you are graded on memorization of formulas. One test had 33 formulas we had to know. He told us we would have a formula sheet but when we got to the test there was no sheet. So not willing to help you and and unclear and unrealistic expectation,0
Wanted to like this class so badly but it was more about memorization than anything else. Grade based on 4 tests and 1 final. BB HW assignments were so tedious and frustrating- unlimited retakes on the HW. The class just got old fairly quickly into the sem,1
"She isn't very helpful, and (in my class at least) often refused to explain problems or questions because she was always in a rush. She would write it out but never explained how she DID the problem. Very frustrating. She grades fairly harshly, but she's a pretty friendly person to just chat with after class.",0
Dr. Merrill is clearly passionate about American history.  His lectures are excellent.  His grading scale also allows for you to improve your grade if he can tell you are working hard.  Take his class--you will enjoy it!,1
"Professor Zein is ridiculously picky about what she looks for when she grades, and it's very difficult to get a feel for what she's really asking.  Her lectures are fairly disorganized and somewhat dull, as are many of the readings.  She expects close reading, deep thinking, and hard work, but that's probably not enough.  Avoid her if possible.",0
This is the worst class i have ever taken in my entire life! its not like an intro class. its a class u would take 4 ur major! its horrible!! she is soo hard & her test are really hard &you have to study so much 2 get a just a decent grade!,0
Je déteste son cours et le prof est assez spécial merci... Cependant il nous donne beaucoup d'informations utiles.,1
I would highly advise you NOT to take this class if you are doing online right now. This class is incredibly discouraging and took a lot of the enjoyment I usually have for writing out of me. It was exhausting how much work I would put into it just to get told it wasnt good enough.,0
"The class mainly consisted of short quizzes and our end of semester project. She is a very hard grader and she takes points off for small mistakes. There wasn't a lot of teaching that was done. Mainly just PowerPoint notes that you do on your own. However, if you do your work and study you should get an A.",0
"Horrible, I regret taking this class. He very opinionated, waste time talking about random things, get angry when you call him out for not doing his job properly, not encouraging towards his Students rather put them down for asking a question or giving their opinions, he not welcoming and he's very rude I just couldn't for it to be over!!",0
"Professor Hanratty is very clear about her expectations on assignments and communicates ideas effectively. She is available for questions and assistance when asked and may not be known to be an ""easy grader"" but is fair in her grading and communicates what you could improve. For this reason, I took both English 121 and 122 from her.",1
"Test have no multiple choice and consist of an essay and all writing. There are 2 exams, and one essay. A VERY hard grader, but note taking is a life saver; don't take notes, don't pass. Before each class, you had a reading of about 20-30 pages followed by a quiz with very specific questions. Super fun, but hard class! Very caring person too!",1
Too much sass. Very disrespectful. she made one of her students cry. Shows no remorse. Speaks in 3rd person. worst accounting teacher  ever. look somewhere else or you will get the worst time of your life.,0
"Is confusing when he speaks. Seems to speak in code. Teaches the language like a science, he really likes to break apart every part of the sentence and ask questions about it. He calls on you to answer his questions even if you dont want to. I would avoid him if you have the choice. Kind of ruined my interest in the french language.",0
Yemut gets frustrated when students ask questions... rolls eyes and goes fast when going over the material. He will ask if anyone has questions but expresses irritation if a question is asked and has a strong accent. I used to love math but since i've taken his class i now hate math,0
Tough tests you can't image!!,0
Had him for both 114 and 115 and was certainly a solid choice. He is very passionate when he teaches which is always nice,1
"Definitely recommend Luallen for Ec 11, man is a stud. Harder than other sections but definitely worth it and the workload is not bad, just study a lot for tests.",1
"At first it was boring & monotone but towards the end you notice his humor, he's really funny, I enjoyed this class and lowkey kinda miss it!",1
"Podewell is the worst Professor I have ever taken.During a three hour class he spends about 30 minutes lecturing basically outlining a chapter or two. Even with reading the book it's VERY hard to do well on an exam, no one can memorize 200 pages. No feedback or help. If I could do it over again I would not take him.",0
I dont understand his teaching at all .he is not a friendly and very difficult to understand his subject especially business students as we do not have an idea in International relations .,0
"Brooke is the BEST math professor Ive ever had in my life! I really struggled with previous classes from other teachers, but Mrs. Kennedy made math a breeze. She gives awesome study guides that cover nearly everything on the tests, so I always felt prepared without wondering what the questions might be on. She is also very enthusiastic & caring!",1
"Hamed is a good teacher but he is very strict. Every midterm he uses an algorithm to assign where each student is going to sit, and exams are pretty hard. Homework is challenging as well because after the second attempt you are getting a 10% penalty, and the 3rd attempt is 30%. If you take him you need to STUDY a lot, he is not joke.",1
Russ explained some concepts very well in class but doesn't cover everything you need to know for the quizzes. The class itself is very easy to get an A in just read the textbook and answer the questions Russ has posted on Blackboard. You don't even need to go to class unless you want to ask him a question. Very easy.,1
"I took this class online(virtual) and she go very fast over the homework problems. It wasn't mandatory that you participated online. She made us meet at the school to take the exams,which I didn't understand since it's a virtual online class.",1
I came in knowing a bit about stats then ended up coming out confused. He doesnt give any help. Email him he tells you to look at the module the book isnt any help he wrote it.,0
"Professor Fazelpour's lectures are very condescending, he seemingly talks down to the class and has a hard time articulating his words and some parts of the lecture are hard to understand due to a harsh accent. Sets seemingly arbitrary rules for homework assignments and passes the buck on any mistakes he makes when it comes to the class in general.",0
The lectures are nonsensical and she goes off tangents constantly without actually discussing the material we need. Her quizzes are unnecessarily difficult and she WILL take forever to grade everything. Her sakai page is unusable and won't be any help throughout the semester. Your knowledge of the subject doesn't really matter in the grand scheme.,0
"she is a good teacher - makes some mistakes in class - but overall it is really easy.  if you spend a total of three hours studying for the final, you'll get an A.  An easy going class if you need the req.",1
"He's a really funny guy and his lectures are pretty enjoyable. There is a lot of material and he does iclicker questions in class. The material is not that hard to grasp, but there is a lot of memorization and some of his questions can be a little bit tricky. That being said all his midterms were 100% multiple choice.",1
"The tricky thing is the online part. It's much harder to ask questions when you're not on the same page, or get feedback. The math program definitely not helpful--responses to wrong answers is a generic explanation to every attempt. The professor never lectures. The answer box is tiny & 4 spaces so you can't see if your whole answer is correct.",1
"Wow, what a joke. This guy is horrible. Changes his mind on everything from day to day. Makes fun and insults people who do poorly on assignments and/or do not understand the material. Told the class ""if you don't understand my lectures, don't come to class!"". I honestly can't explain in 350 characters how big of a jerk he is. Avoid him at all cost",0
"Worst teacher in St.peters history...dont get her she will give you an ""F' on every paper",0
"Dr. Ionascu is one of few funny and knowledgeable teachers. She sometimes goes off on a tangent with random stories, but she knows the material really well. Her tests are pretty much exactly the same as the review material, so the classes ended up being pretty easy.",1
"If you can, definitely take Stat 105/305 with him. His practice exams are almost identical to the real tests and he is very nice. Would highly recommend him over any other stats professor.",1
"Prof. Carty's science class will keep you on the edge of your seat. His profound knowledge for Science is filled with passion and mind boggling discoveries. His energy and humble personality is comforting in the midsts of midterms or finals. He lights up a room, and allows for strong dialogue amongst the students.",1
Dr. Buck really cares about his students and wants them to succeed. I highly recommend taking his class. He covers the material very clearly and is an overall excellent instructor.,1
He is not a good teacher of econ 110 . im sure his higher level courses are more interesting but he tries to get people to decide against being an econ major so that so many people are not in the econ program. department chair. wants to route out people who are not great at econ,0
"Great facilitator... makes you think.  Very fair.  Entertaining, funny, witty, and knowledgeable",1
excellent teacher if you didn't think you could draw. you will think otherwise after his class.,1
"Best Professor i have taken so far. Weekly zoom class meetings, weekly pre-class work and article reviews. Pre-quiz before class and post quiz after class. Do your work dont wait last minute. 2 exams a tad bit difficult.",1
supportive and harsh to. you can tell who she likes and who she doesn't. Seomtimes has attitude. Doesn't respond to emails or follow-up on things.,0
She takes attendance EVERY class! Actually paying attention is optional. Don't bother buying the book; everything is in the powerpoints she gives you. You must memorize absolutely everything in those slides though. Tests are lots of multiple choice and a few essay style Q's. Read Q's very carefully. Will have a paper and group pres at the end.,1
"When he left the class for the last time, all 11 out of 22 students who normally showed up looked at each other and were saying, ""Thank god this is over with.""",0
"Her class is easy as long as you complete assignments and listen to her lectures. She also posts the powerpoints online if you can't attend class. Very easy, great professor",1
"Bon prof, très drole, des examens à la portés de tout le monde, je le recommande :) ",1
"This guy speeds through organic chemistry material like it is simple addition in a calculus class. He does not teach well. If asked to break something down he is sometimes understandable, but plan on using him as a supplement to the textbook. I strongly advise taking anyone but him if possible.",0
"Terrible professor. Isn't clear with the topics she's discussing; she starts talking about something then completely changes the subject or moves on to say something else. I passed with a B+, however, I would never take her again. I dreaded going to her class and listening to her lectures. She was all over the place.",0
Shah is a great professor and always keeps students interested in the material. He is funny and his lectures are anything but dry. He shares real-life experiences that make up a lot of lecture. Great professor and definitely learned a lot from this course,1
"Do not take his class. For the field class prepare for the class to end sometimes more than an hour past what is schedule. Very strict grader, heavy on the report papers every week. Boden teaches intro level classes but teaches them in a more complex way than most people understand. In other words, if you dont know a lot about geology good luck",0
"She's awful!!!!! I had an online class with her. Slow response, & because she wouldn't response quickly to my email. I would do homework incorrectly & endedup getting a bad grade.  She's awful!",0
"This is a great teacher, you have to do some work, but if you do you cannot fail. Probably one of the best teachers at this school",1
"seriously dont know whats up with the good comments. she is unclear, cannot answer questions, moves through the material too fast, and reads directly from a powerpoint. DONT TAKE HER! you can get a better grade in another section",0
"Professor Xian has a very good way of simplifying the topics discussed to help us understand it quicker. When students asked questions that were related to the topic discussed, but on a more personal example, the professor was professional and ethical with her answers. If students looked confused or needed clarification on topics discussed, the pro",1
She is by far my favorite instructor I've had. She's very caring and fair!,1
"Great Professor! As long as you attend the lectures and do all the home work you will pass. There are plenty of options for extra credit. He explains complicated topics simply in an easy to understand manner, would take again.",1
"She tries and fails to relate to students. She lectures about the exact same topic day after day, ad nauseam. She is probably one of the most boring lecturers Ive ever had to sit through.",0
I have to agree.  I'm getting ready to drop this class also.  Had our first exam and wouldn't even do a review. Said we should know this stuff already.  I knew nothing on the test.  I don't know if he realizes that he's not teaching anything - just assuming that we already know everything and going from chapter through chapter at a very rapid pace.,0
Maria is the BEST Professor I have ever had. She's big on thinking like a nurse and guiding us. Her lectures are AMAZING!! She breaks everything down into simpler terms and tells us what is nice to know vs a need to know. I wish she still taught 2nd level because I would've loved to have her again!,1
"Did not like his lectures, learned on my own. ",0
"A lot of reading and useless papers, but if you come to class and pay attention, he tells you EXACTLY what you need. He's super helpful if you go to office hours. A little intimidating, but he's a great guy and knows A LOT about communication.",1
"Took her class for UI100, and while it was a lot of busy work, as long as you did it, you should pass with an A. There aren't tests, just a few presentations that she gives you 2-3 weeks to put together. I reccomend it",1
"The lectures are heavy and he doesnt write anything down, he just goes off his own PowerPoints that are poorly made and have many errors and always goes off topic. He doesnt discuss the homework or how the equations work. He is no where to be seen after or before class if you have questions, doesnt care about students, hes a terrible professor.",0
"Shes such a nice person & really cares about the profession, very laid back and pretty flexible when it comes to assignments and attendance as she knows life can be chaotic. Assignments are very strait forward. She gives PLENTY of time to get all of your assignments/papers done so dont procrastinate bc theyll add up. She loves participation!",1
"(The honor section) His idea is very clear, his logic is extremely strict and his proof is always complete. The class is almost perfect except that..................I cannot understand........",1
"Professor Wo is one of the most wonderful professors I have taken here at SSU. There are a lot of comments on here about not being able to understand her accent, and that's really sad. I think if you take her you'll see that's ridiculous. These are just students who aren't willing to put the absolutely minimal effort in to listen.",1
"Tompson is awesome. She is knowledgable and passionate about psychology and is animated and fun which keeps you awake for 8 AM lectures. only thing is- you need to go to the lectures or you'll be lost on the exams. If you go to lecture and take good notes, you're set! definitely recommend.",1
"Definitely not worth the hype. The professor was hella dry and I did not find this class interesting at all. His lectures and extremely boring. I found his essay topics unclear, and some of the readings were just so tedious and inconvenient. The class is graded on very little things so your grade is very dependent on each test.",0
"This guy is probably a good engineering and knows what he is talking about. However his English comprehension SUCKS! He cannot communicate clearly with the class, mumbles his words, mis-spells on the board, and when a question is asked he doesn't really understand what is being asked. Although he is a nice guy, he isn't a good teacher period. ",0
This class by far the worst class that I have ever taken at this college. Be prepared to stay up till 4 am 4 nights in a row studying for her quizzes and tests. I have seeked help from her and a tutor multiple times and neither were help at all. I feel she sets us up for failure. She takes forever at the beginning then goes physco at the end. awful,0
"She is a nice person but I found her ineffective as a prof. Very confusing, as she seems to go in circles with her explanations and will never give you a straight forward answer. I highly recommend the textbook as that is the only way I learnt anything, I taught myself the entire lecture. She was defensive when I voiced my confusion. Unapproachable",0
"He has amazing lectures! I took his night class and he kept me learning, entertained, and awake the whole time! His class can be tough at times because you really have to remember all that he told you but since he speaks so well it's not too difficult. He also has a couple papers that are super easy and flexible. Just hit all the points he asks.",1
The best professor I've ever had in my life. He is awesome and his beard will make you feel cozy. He is a very legendary professor and I am so privileged to have taken his course. You will not regret it.,1
took a basic intro class with prof peters and made the drastic mistake of signing up for her 3 hour once per week class. She expected us to come to class having already read/outlined the chapter and know most of the information beforehand. we covered at least 1 chapter per class and the info was a lot at one sitting. not terrible but not great.,1
"I made an A+ in this class - all quizzes and exams are online and are T/F, however, Prof. Frazier is very rude and has snarky comments. He is very harsh on attendance and says it counts for a grade yet actually doesnt. If you can manage his weird teaching ways its an easy A class.",0
Mantone is easily one of the best math prof's i've ever had. she's really good at explaining concepts in a different way and has a good sense of humor about her lectures. her new york accent is hardly noticeable once you're used to being in her class. i recommend her to any future math 105 students,1
good teacher.  tough but fair decent sense of humour,1
Roxi is a tough cookie to crack but a really good writing teacher. Definitely made for an interesting quarter not knowing if she liked me or not. She really cares about class participation so come to class with one thing to say about the reading and she'll love you. Also write with passion and she'll dig it no matter what it is.,1
Ms. Brock is so caring!! She really cares about student's progress and always willing to help students! She is amazing!!,1
Dr. Meade has the chance to teach a very interesting class on ethnicity in literature and yet even to someone who is passionate about literary analysis this class bores me to tears. He keeps discussion superficial and the chance to delve deeper into an author's intentions are overshadowed by discussions of formatting. Easy A if you read,1
"The ancients told us of a man who was born beyond time who would come down to bless us engineering students with the wisdom and knowledge from beyond. But seriously, this class is definitely the most helpful with understanding engineering in an industrial setting and will prepare you for real-world engineering.",1
"I'm lucky if I'll even pass with a C+ as I have yet to complete the last few assignments and final exam. He has a very clear grading criterion, but it's extremely nitty-gritty, almost petty, with even the smallest of assignments. His feedback in the comments of discussion posts and other assignments is more often than not in a condescending tone.",0
"Sears wants you to think, plain and simple. Memorization will get you nowhere. His classes have helped me with every other subject I have ever taken because he teaches you CRITICAL THINKING through the lens of immunobiology. This class is difficult, VERY difficult, but incredibly rewarding. He seems scary, but is actually a very kind and caring.",1
"The negative comment about this teacher is simply not true. Professor Lamprey is easy going, knowledgeable, and helpful. You basically get what you put in and if you want respect, do your homework and show up to class. Easy ""A"".",1
"hes terrible, miserable, and rude. he always gets mad when no one answers his questions in class and when people do answer them but are wrong, he calls you out and makes you feel dumb!!! no wonder no one answers your questions! tests are like they're in a different language, not on anything you actually learn. would not recommend to even an enemy",0
"Dr. Jones is extremely knowledgeable in his field. I started off by reading the assigned books/text, but every lecture was a repeat of the material, so I stopped reading ahead of class and maintained high As on the in-class essays. Most classes have an aspect of talking to your small group, or as a class as a whole.",1
"Plays favorties with students, disorganized, unclear on learing objectives, unwilling to help or answer questions, tests are very unrepersentive of course material, etc....  Need i say more?  I'd reccomend him to find a new profession",0
"Course went online after the pandemic. He was basically just reading off from slides for three hours and it was hard to keep focused. The course would be better if he presents an outline of everything we are learning, and revisits it every week for a few minutes. I felt the topics skipped unrelatedly each week.",0
"Here's the thing - Fontenot is one of the professors that, if you're a comp sci, you'll have to take him for a few semesters. Get on his good side. Don't sleep in class or act like you already know the material. Not all TAs are super helpful, but the internet exists. Data Structures is a difficult course, but I have seen improvement in my code.",1
"This guy is propably one of the worst professor in the histoty of teaching. He'd tell you all these nice things in the begining, and then he'd turn against you.",0
Don't expect to get a good grade .,0
"He is an easy grader on the papers. His directions are unclear, specifically on when his discussion posts are due when he opens them at random. Tests are easy if you use the book. Powerpoints are not really useful. Will email you back promptly. Ask for help or direction if u need it. Easy A, just did not want to work that hard for a music class.",1
"She assigns SOOOO many things throughout the semester, doesn't explain how she wants it done, and then takes points off when you do it wrong, even if it's just the ""draft."" I've never had a professor give this many assignments. I really can't stand her class and can't wait for the semester to be over. If you can avoid taking her, then do so.",0
"Pros: he knows what he's talking about Cons: cocky, arrogant, belittles any student who asks him a question",0
"Really personable, really interesting, really good guy. If you can't take classics classes with him, at least do your cultural heritage with him. It's a really great time. Discussions are lively and relevant, and the class is really engaging.",1
He failed me even though I got  an 80% on the group project... Terrible prof. Not responsive to emails at all.,0
Useless professor knows math but doesn't know how to teach. You would have to teach yourself if your taking his class. Do NOT take him it would be a waste of time plus his grading methods are weird.,0
"P.Davis has very clear instructions and expectations. Always had feedback and good questions. 1 wkly DB, M.C midterm and final (open book), 3 papers, but they are not hard. You learn if you choose to do the work. I'm military and needed an extension, and she was understanding, although she does have a policy about that, so be sure to read it.",1
"Anne's lectures were very long and dense. There were a lot of papers to write that had a lot of weight on your grade. The study sessions with the TAs before the tests were really helpful- they literally give you all the answers in order, so go to those and just copy everything down then memorize it and you'll pass the test.",0
Extremely SCATTERBRAINED! Lets you use cheat sheets during tests but not the final! Tells more stories about her family and illnesses than the actual info you need to know. Group work with a different group every time! Always changes due dates and be ready to have multiple mistakes made when grading your tests! So hard to follow! Steer Clear!!!,0
"Dr. Johnson is amazing! She really wants to make class more interesting and always asks for student feedback to better the classherself. The readings for this class are a little dry, but the lectures aren't bad. 4 papers (but you pick 2) 2 exams (midterm and final) and a group project. Definitely take her for this class!",1
"Not super note-heavy, so you can focus more on what he's saying rather than trying to copy the notes. There's quizzes after every chapter as well as homework for every chapter that is due when you take the tests. Overall, he's a really nice and understanding professor who makes his lectures interesting and clearly cares about all of his students.",1
"She is kind of rude, spent most of the class watching her try and get the projector to work. There are quizzes at the beginning of every class and one project which isn't hard, luckily for future classes you'll have demo of what she is looking for. The midterm was hard it is mostly off of the power points and the final is exactly the midterm.",0
Does not explain anything. Lazy does not reply to email or mymathlab questions. Poor communication skills if you can stay far away from this teacher. ,0
"Dr. B is the best professor I've had yet. He makes class lively and enjoyable. If you listen in class and do the homework, it's a simple A+ too. I would highly recommend him!",1
"Very good, kind teacher.  The class was super easy, 5 or 6 papers throughout term, hybrid course.  Hardest thing was research paper, but relatively easy if you put your mind to it.  Would recommend her highly and take her again.",1
"I do not recommend taking this class with Paul. I should have read the Rate My Professor comments before signing up. I am a college graduate taking courses for extra credits, and this class demands more work than some of my upper level accounting courses. I asked for help from Paul several times, and he was no help at all. Extremely harsh grader.",0
"While attendence is not mandatory, his lectures are so interesting that students want to be there. His tests are fairly difficult, but as long as your study and attend lecture it's not that bad.",1
"Pros:  She does seem to know the material, gives opportunities for extra credit, and in my opinion genuinely tries to help students understand the material.  Cons:  She is a bit quirky, as a lot of professors tend to be.  She can come across as rude/arrogant, but I think that is mostly a result of her quirks.  Tests are hard; she makes you think.",1
"I think the curriculum for SPAN302 is poorly designed, with too much busywork, both in class and for homework, and not nearly enough opportunities to have conversations and actually learn Spanish. With that said, Professor Newall did his best to work with it, and he is a very caring professor, so I'm sure he will improve, as this was his first year",1
DON'T EVER TAKE THIS PROF'S CLASS. EVER. THE WORST PROF,0
She's a good teacher who gave you the information that was needed in order to do the assignment. Coming from zero coding experience I thought her assignments were reasonable. As long as you put in the effort and start the assignment before the night it is due you will do just fine. The hardest part about this class was handwritten code on tests.,1
Amazing teacher! He is one of those teachers who knows exactly what he is talking about and is able to explain things thoroughly because of his knowledge.  Studying is not really needed because he explains everything in class. People say he doesnt help u on anything and he does but when they are dumb questions he lets u figure them out on ur own,1
"Coop is interesting, funny, and understanding, yet he is extremely hard to understand and follow even the most basic algorithmic foundations. He s a good person, not a good professor.",0
There really isn't that much homework.  There are only three test but they are hard.  His reviews suck not helpful at all.  He just expects that you know this stuff bc he is used to teaching higher level course.,0
"This professor would pick on specific people. There was one girl in my class who she would be extremely negative towards. She would make fun of her when she wasn't in class, tell her her ideas for projects were terrible with no constructive criticism. She lacked a professional attitude and she seemed to lack compassion for her students.",0
Professor Henry is an amazing professor & person. Her class did require A LOT of work and she is a tough grader but she does care for her students!,1
"This professor is the most unattached being from her students, she don't answer emails. BUT the one time she did she was sweet and her class is also very easy. The material is super interesting and you NEED the book, the book is really interesting I read it for fun. Other than that there are 4 tests (cake if you have the book)",1
"I didn't really care for the class, but Josh's sense of humor made it very bearable. He's not a pushover and my French improved a lot. The pop quizzes were near impossible though.",1
"a nice person (even tho she may come off rude) she's a really hard grader and gives a lot of work during the last month of the semester, it's overwhelming Get out if you can, the other professors are easy",0
She does not prepare you the at all for anything. As a result the class has a failing average!SWITCH OUT if you have the chance!,0
"Only reads off the slides. You can download slides but is NOT very helpful. Funny Heavy accent when he says ""packet"", and hard to understand what he writes (scribbles etc)Go to his office & he will ask you rhetorical questions but he will help u in his office but is difficult to comprehend his teaching u the stuff. Take this class at own risk.",0
SUUUUCH a great man. I took his class 3 years ago as a freshman and he still is one of my absolute favorites. Offers fun extra credit opportunities outside of the classroom and really cares about his students. Have him for an 8am and struggle to get up? He'll give you a call to make sure you come!,1
She is a good teacher but isn't as helpful as people say. I asked for help all semester and she kept emailing me to go to the math lab or come 30 minutes before class but that wasn't enough time. She is rude and doesn't care about your concerns. Would've passed with a B but she wouldn't give me the help I needed.,0
Professor victor is the best. I took this class wth another professor but I dropped because  was hard for me. Professor Lombardo will help you and he is calm and funny at the same time. He always makes sure everyone in the class understand what he is teaching. I really recommend Professor Victor and you will enjoy ITE 115 like never before. I GOT A,1
"I took professor Aguilar my spring semester for 1302 and I would not reccomend to take her. She gets distracted very easily and gives assignments that are six pages long, sometimes more. She does set the boundaries straight from the beggining of the course and she will not take late work.",0
"This is an extremely easy class, but also extremely pointless. None of the information is useful, so she does try to make it a little interesting but it is hopeless. You print out the notes for class so there is little effort involved. Just memorize and know the general concepts for the test and it is a breeze.",1
"Nicest guy you will ever meet but worst prof. Don't let his charm fool you! he has a strong social game that will make you like him and forget how bad a prof he is. Exam 100% textbook, his lecture is fun but 0% exam. Expect to work twice as hard for a grade that is half as good from a prof that does not know how to teach.  For your own good AVOID.",0
Subjective professor. No lecture slides. No office hours. Does not answer questions through emails. But the class is interesting,0
"Class was so confusing that I forgot who I was, where I was, and what I was doing -- it's a great stress reliever.",0
"Do not take this class unless you already know the material beforehand, He does not teach, he sits at the front and types in a bunch of code and if you are not sitting in the front row you cannot hear him. Best advise is to take this course at another college.",0
"Take anyone else for writing composition. I didn't enjoy this professor's lack of respect towards her students. Tough grader, have to go to class or you'll fail, pushes agenda on students, just don't take her.",0
The first genetics exam proves that this is the worst teacher at RIT.  She does not teach anything but willing to give an exam.,0
he is really strict regarding grades.,0
"She's insanely hard! I had to work extremely hard in her class to pull a C. When she lectures, she talks too fast and in a way that no one understands. I like her as a person she's very nice. Would I ever take a class with her again? Absolutely not.",0
"Good lecturer, but his lectures are all about theory and not about how to solve the problems on his tests, which look nothing like the problems in the textbook and he gives no problems sets or quizzes to prepare. Not helpful or interested in helping - refused to explain a basic concept in office hours because it was below him. Avoid at all costs. ",0
He's new at teaching and is still learning which means he's awful at the moment. His study guides have typos and his answers aren't even right. He takes away points if you want to check your online connect homework to see if its correct. His classes are slow and he often goes on tangents about Greek philosophy.,0
Mrs. Gray is very knowledgeable and makes the subject easier to understand.,1
GREAT professor! recomend taking his class,1
He gives us a ton of homework thats way harder than what he taught us. Most of the time he doesnt go through a problem completely he just goes through the method in the beginning but then expects you to know exactly what to do after. Hes also a bit passive aggressive when someone tries to be smart or asks a question.,0
"I'm taking Phil 7 - Intro to Critical Thinking, and this class is seriously the worst class ever. The material isn't too difficult, but the professor makes everything about this class bad. He wrote the textbook, and it's REALLY boring to read. you HAVE to go to class b/c he makes you hand in HW on Tues, short quiz on Thurs, and big quiz on Friday.",0
I took this class online which I was very hesitant about but I don't regret it at all!!!!! I loved the way the class was laid out and everything was very clear! Mr. Carter is very easy to get ahold of and always lets his students know when he will be out of the office. I would recommend Joe Carter to anyone!,1
David is an amazing teacher as well a cool person.  His lessons are all from experience and he tells real life stories.  His test are a little hard but he gives you everything you need to know for them.  I highly recommend taking a class from him especially if you are thinking about owning your own business someday.,1
"Worst teacher I've ever had, homework is worth the most in her class and she grades it extremely hard, DO NOT SIGN UP FOR HER CLASS,  I showed up for every class, did every homework, and passed every test with a B- or higher. I'm a honor student and she failed me",0
don't take this class,0
Annoying and hard to listen to. For the love of god say the word verBs. Its not verVs. Her class was a mistake to take. Expects you to have gotten 100% in Spanish 12 when you're not even allowed to take it with span 12. Makes stupid jokes that aren't funny. Mainly talks about how much she loves random celebrities and how old she is,0
I would not take this professor if you are really wanting to learn biology. He gets off topic very easily and his notes taken in class do not correlate to the test. He takes attendance at different times during lecture but if you leave early will change it to show absent.,0
"Awful teacher, gives way too vague prompts for essays and doesn't hand back graded ones until way after the next one is due, It could be months past the first essay and you still will not have it back, also assigns homeowork late at night due he next day in the morning",0
"The most boring class I have ever taken. He lectures every class. You look around and 90% of the people are either asleep or watching Netflix. This class is nothing but abstract, liberal ideology that makes no sense. But its an easy A honestly.",0
"I attended Prof. Ross' class in 1994 and I have never been as engaged, reflective and verbal in class. He is simply the best teacher I've had and our discussions continued on train 4 downtown after classes. Since then I've taught and become a professor myself, but I'm nothing like Prof. Ross in class. I wish to thank him and recommend him.",1
Good person has a passion for music however the class was pretty hard to pass.  If your not into jazz and cant dedicate enough time to listen to it daily you wont do well on the exams. The exams are hard and on top of that they are only 12 to 19 questions so it harder to pass.  Lectures have nothing to do with exam. Reminder this is for MUS108*,0
"Professor Hutton was a very tough grader, It was very hard to fix what she wanted on the rubric because she was not very specific on what she wanted she also quizzes you on what she likes. (EDU 104)",0
He is a tough grader but is clear of what is expected. He tends to go off topic a lot and talks really fast so it makes it hard to understand. If you are not able to reach him during his office hours then he will find time to meet and discuss assignments.,1
Best professor ever !! She is a great human being. You will utilize your textbook- so make sure u buy it.,1
Love her! She is dynamic in teaching and passionately engages in the subject. I enjoyed this class because of her.,1
"Took Eng 114 and he's a really great professor. Pretty easy, finishes class early all of the time. Essays are easy and relatable. No final and optional essays at the end that help boost your grade. Super great class and never rushes students. If you need to re-edit your essay last minute, he gives extra time with no penalty.",1
"This class was awesome. The lectures are so interesting and he's good at ensuring you understand the material.  His test format is great - you get to take the same test three times and he gives feedback each time to help you master each topic. Due dates did change a bit, but wasn't his fault and was always to give us more time. Def take this class!",1
"What the last person said, exactally...",0
Dr. Mirbod is Awesome! Very knowledgeable and caring professor.  she teaches the way that students can relate and understand. not a tough grader.,1
"Janey's class is super hard, but she teaches it well and does a pretty good job of helping you understand some of the more confusing material. Her late work policy is very relaxed, but it definitely helps to do the work ahead of time in her class. Otherwise, she's super nice and has a good sense of humor and knows the material extremely well.",1
"TLS 356 was a very informative class. I really enjoyed the content of the course. There a lot of little papers, but they're no longer than 400 words which isn't bad. He does daily participation, so I suggest going to class. There are also quizzes almost every week, but most of the articles can be found online, so you don't really need to read it..",1
A very nice and approachable professor who was willing to meet with me. Be sure to ask for help as many of the students thought that they were doing fine on their projects and then dropped the class when they found out otherwise.,1
Horrible prof her lectures dont match our assignments/ test and she makes us pay for wiley cuz she doesnt want to make her own exam.. when we could be doing the exam on BB for free Avoid if you can plz,0
"I don't know enough about Poole's teaching methods in-person, but online they were really poor. Two lectures split into a mandatory ""active learning session,"" and the other a link to a 10-20 minute long Youtube video. It was very disappointing because the topic of the class was so interesting, but it was difficult to learn with her teaching method.",0
"There's guide a bit of content in this course, so this isn't a bird course. You can do all of the quizzes/midterm off of the textbook, no need to watch the lectures.",1
"Gives directions very quickly and sometimes makes it hard to follow lecture/lessons. Often says he'll ""lecture for 30 minutes and then you'll have time to work"" but frequently the lectures lasted much longer, resulting in little in-class time to work & ask questions. Though, he is helpful when you ask questions.",0
"Easy A. Obnoxious amount of easy extra credit that will offset bad grades on exams. Final is NON cumulative! Yes, she is hard to understand, but her slides are very clear and exam questions are exact copy of what we did in class.",0
She has been a great instructor who is very passionate and knowledgeable about nursing.  I think she is amazing and would recommend her to everyone in the future.,1
"He is a really good teacher.  He is always available for any questions, and he usually curves the test depending on how everyone did. If you get to know him and he knows you are trying you will make a good grade. Test are off of the power points from class. If you get a chance take him!!",1
"If you turn your assignments in early, she grades them early. But she also leaves feedback, so if you don't get the grade you expected/think you can do better, she allows you to resubmit homework for a better grade.",1
Professor Adve is an amazing lecturer and was one of the most inspiring reasons why I later went in depth into Communications and Control Systems in my undergrade career. You will not regret being in his class!,1
"The class is called avoding sexual harassment.  I think there are way too much reading considering it is only a one credit class.  Plus there is a final exam which I think is unnecessary.  If you need a one credit class, take something easier.",0
"He's great! Take him if you have problems in Math as he will explain everything. Homework is due about every week over the online access. Exams are open book, open notes but not to take lightly. He grades nicely, if you are on the right track, he'll give you a lot of points. I would recommend to take him if you have heard ""the bad"" about FINA 311.",1
Why are they still letting this woman teach?,0
I got a good grade but I don't feel like I learned anything. I emailed him a few times with no reply. That's not good for an online class!! If you don't need to talk to a teacher he's the man for you.,0
OK,1
"Great teacher, if your willing to put in the work. I had to take English again because I missed so many classes the first time because I hated the teacher I had. She's very helpful, especially when writing/editing papers. I would definitely recommend her to anyone who's not the best at English but wants to succeed.",1
"Ryan is a very nice guy and is receptive to feedback. However, he is not a very good professor and is extremely unorganized in his lectures. Doesn't really seem prepared a lot of times and students are forced to wait for him in class. He is very unclear on his grading and changes his expectations all the time. 10/10 would not recommend",0
"Dr. Maher really knows his stuff. During lectures, he never used any notes or books to go off of. However, he wasn't very much help when it came to tests. The essay tests were challenging but not impossible. He often times did not make clear what information would be on the exam. Attendance is taken but means nothing but I suggest going to class.",0
"Oyamont, I know you're reading this. The only complaint I have for your class is that your lectures BARLEY cover the concepts on your study guide. I feel like this class should be offered as a hybrid class since half the time I was looking up studies on the internet more than in your lectures/my notes. Class is okay but very dull. Easy if you try.",1
"He is an amazing teacher! I would recommend him to all! He teaches his lectures by telling a story, it makes time go by so fast and you are learning all the while! Test are exactly from the study guides, only had to do 2 papers the whole semester, he is overall a great teacher! I will take him again next year for 1302! ",1
"Dr. Vohs is an entertaining teacher and a grade head of the chemistry department. He is by far the most organized teacher I have come across in college, which carries over into his teaching style.",1
"There is quite a lot of reading, but Li gives amazing feedback and cares for the students! Loads of extra credit! The textbook is online and is quite the money saver. Make sure to read and watch all material early so you can get a head start on the assignments. The assignments are hefty with 600 words each. The grade you earn is what you work for",1
"He does have an accent, but it's not that hard to understand him. Almost your entire grade is made up of tests and quizzes, but that's the way the course is set up. He grades tests fairly and gives partial credits. He posts practice problems and Powerpoints to Blackboard. He does example problems in class sometimes. I wish he also taught Chem 132.",1
Wonderful teacher. Learned so much. Clearly he is passionate about the subject and shares that with the class. A real gem for canadian jazz - hope more people get to benefit from his great knowledge.,1
-Grammar checks contradicted each other throughout the drafts of an essay. -Directions are mostly unclear and vague. -Talks more about her other jobs than finishing a chapter lecture. -Exams are not based on power-point lectures but unnecessary information from the textbook.,0
Awesome professor and one of the  best experiences I have had so far at a Math class in UT. His lectures are really helpful and fun and most of the questions on the quizzes and tests are the ones that he has solved in class. Make sure to take notes as it helps a ton during tests and quizzes.,1
"Will never forget the endless stress and exhaustion this class gave to me. Doesn't teach well, assumes students are dumb but in reality we're just completely lost and always says to ""google"" if you can't find an answer. -_- Takes aways 10% of final grade if you are absent once and was consistently late to class. Don't take unless you know coding!",0
"Great teacher, completely knows what he is talking and tells great jokes.  Tough class and tests though.",1
"I did not really like that she spent the first half of the semester solidifying grammar, but other than that, great assignments/essays to get you critically thinking. Helps establish good habits of analyzing and LOTS of discussions. She grades essays pretty harsh though, but her feedback helps you become a better writer for sure.",1
"Great professor. I really enjoyed the course material, and he is clearly very knowledgeable about the topics.",1
"Super chill guy, really interested in what he's teaching which makes the class a lot better. Involves a lot of reading and a decent amount of writing. He usually takes attendance after add/drop period ends so going to class doesn't go unnoticed. No textbook just articles and readings that he posts on courseweb for you.",1
"Though hard to tell, this professor enjoys Physics, and will work with you. However, his grading criteria is very unclear and leaves you guessing often. He puts formulas on the board during tests but seldom do they help. Being in a lecture hall his mumbling does not make his lectures any easier to follow. Content on tests don't match lecture.",0
"He's a pretty bad prof. Doesn't explain anything well, expect to be confused in class and abuse your economics friends for help. Econ is hard to get a good prof for so he may be one of the better ones , as sad as it may seem.",0
i hate english but i love prof sherman. she really gave me a new outlook on literature. very understanding. lots of reading and writing. i recommend this prof,1
"In lab or out of class, Mr. Dr. Woodard is very nice and approachable. Makes jokes and usually discusses things with you if you have questions/need help. In class, however, can be irritable to a fault and often changes mind about what material we are studying (I.E. changing worksheet for our weekly quiz about five times every week) Lots of writing.",1
"I withdrew  from the class, as well as many others! We started with maybe 15 or more, by the time I dropped there were 6.  She did not teach the subject where the student could understand and retain the information! If you ask for help during class, her response is always ""Well..., I don't understand why you don't understand"".",0
"Professor Schnoebelen is an amazing professor. She explains everything in a way that's easy to understand. I got solid A's on both midterms and the final. Her exams are very reflective of lecture material and practice problems/ discussion worksheets, so if you just stay and memorize those, you'll be prepared.",1
"Make sure you have reliable internet, a decent computer, and you are a fast test taker. She will not allow you a chance to make up time lost during any test if you have connection issues, she's not helpful. She is a pretty rough grader but involved in discussions. The assignments are not hard and she gives a few extra credits throughout if needed.",0
"Excellent prof, expérience hors du commun. Très drôle !",1
"As much as I'd love to find the good in professor Vitz at UCSD, I simply cannot. He does not ""lecture"" he simply reads out of the articles and adds unnecessary pauses in his voice to make it sound educating. Papers require lecture citations but all uploaded power points are useless (they are just pictures & words with no context). Avoid taking him.",0
"I cant believe ASU still lets this guy teach such out of date material. 90% is math no one in the industry uses. Last week was the only time we actually worked/talked about wireless networking. Moreover this is the only one that teaches this class.. Constantly blames the graders, and who grades ridiculously hard.",0
Hard on grading and doesn't any mercy on helping you out on your grade.,0
Professor Smith is extremely caring. Study the lab exercises for the practical. You MUST make sure you put out time to study for this class. Attendance is mandatory ( there is a grade for that) Study the objectives for anatomy and physiology for the practical too. DO THE HOMEWORK. HINT HINT for practicals.,1
I found this class to be very time consuming. Dont expect an easy A. The book is boring especially if this is not your major. The online quizzes were annoying especially if you do them on your own.,1
"For someone not interested in math, this class was very dull and seemed to be a lot harder than it would have to be. She seems pleasant enough but doesn't make any attempt to connect to most students. Not a great teacher; take someone else for 125 if you can.",0
"in office hours he refused to tell me which multiple choice questions I got wrong (after the exam): how is someone supposed to proactively improve their stratgies and weak areas, if they are not told which questions are wrong. What is the ppoint of picking up an exam that has no marks except for a total on the top. He doesnt even post an answer key",0
"I dislike science, but this is the best breadth course!! I learned a ton of important info also. Attendance not mandatory, but definitely watch the lectures. He's super helpful, passionate, and knowledgable, willing to answer any and all questions! I highly suggest taking this class.",1
"Class is darn near pointless. He never worked out one single problem in class, he just throws up a sheet of paper with how to do it for 20 seconds ",0
"He doesn't give extra credit, even if you are failing. You ABSOLUTELY have to show your work on his tests or he marks the question wrong even if you got the right answer. You cannot use a graphing calculator only scientific. He goes through lessons really fast so if you aren't good at math, this is a difficult class. I had to drop his class.",0
"He's very nice but KEEP IN MIND he's a harsh grader on the speeches. My major is journalism and I've received A's in all my writing classes, i'm a great public speaker I never get nervous, but he still gave me a B even though I did all my speeches and came to class. The girl next to me missed half her speeches and did a terrible job but got an A...",0
Worst teacher I've ever had in my life. Completely useless. Does not know anything about graphic design and is horrible at giving feedback. He belittles his students and finds pleasure in embarrassing them in front of the class. Any good reviews on here were probably written by him.,0
"Ms. Carter was professional and consistent with her teaching and helpful qualities. She applied real life examples of her work to the lessons so that we could understand the material  rather than memorizing, which most are use to Students who had issues with her were those who thought they would get good grades and not work for it Class had several",1
"Her class is very boring she doesnt have a clue how to grade, assignments. I have her next semester and I dont want to be in her class.",0
"First off, shes a HORRIBLE teacher; I dont understand how she was awarded the Fulbright Scholar for teaching. She's hard to understand in lecture, and belittles you in front of classmates when SHE's the one who is unclear. She also doesn't reply to emails in a NICE manner. I've never met anyone more rude in my life. Stay away from UHCL bc of her.",0
"Dr. Ryner is scary smart. He thinks like no one else I have ever met, and I mean that in a good way! He is probably one of the most intriguing and kind professors at ASU. Admittedly, the theory he introduces can be hard to grasp at first, and his papers, while short, are still rather hard. However, it's worth it. Also, he's always there to help!",1
"u cant believe an exactly 100 class is hard like this, as a starting course in university. It's heavy on both memorization and thinking, which means you need memorize tons of stuff and apply them quickly -- 50 questions per 75 mins for midterms, 80 questions in two hours for final. AND the professor has a ridiculous accent, can I say dirty words???",0
"Ms Carter is a great teacher. She is professional and discusses the material only required for the class. She will help if needed. She tries to make sure everyone understands the subject. She gives notes and reviews for every quiz and exam. Don't try to take advantage of her. If you think it's going to be an easy A, it's not. You have to earn it!",1
She is very energetic and kind. She will give bonus when necessary and sometimes when not needed. Study the material and she will help you do well in her class.,1
"Super full of herself. First class she said ""Don't pay attention to RateMyProfessor reviews."" Thinks she's the greatest teacher ever. Super condescending and rude. VERY clearly favors students for non-academic reasons. Whatever you do, avoid at all costs. Seriously.",0
Was super nice however used apps that didn't always work. She was willing to work with you but it did not always help. The homework does take tons of time so be ready to spend a few days doing it. she doesn't have a set criteria when it comes to the notebook that she makes you write in.,0
Took Prof. Cygan for Music 101. TBH as a previous piano player I thought I would do good in this class because I know a little about music but this class was not all that easy. The class website is a little weird but I got the hang of it after a while. Prof Cygan gives great feedback but you never really know when things are due. Overall just okay.,1
"I dreaded every single one of her classes. She constantly gives the class lectures about how our class is lazy and dumb and that we should go to community college instead. After she explains her lectures she always asks, ""do you understand? yes or no?""  although this class is an easy A, i do not recommend it at all. ",0
"I enjoyed prof Haucks lectures and his ability to talk about genetics in simple terms.  I was a health science major, but switched to biology because of his passion for genetics and science and education.",1
"She's Awful Awful don't take her if you register her class for now drop her today is last day to drop classes ,",0
"Shapiro is  super knowledgeable about the Chinese history and environmental politics, and she  shares fascinating stories from her past and work. She is deeply connected to the fields and often brought in guest speakers. She is strongly opinionated, which is good, but it can color her teaching. Other 2016 SIS140 students exaggerate the difficulty.",1
By far without a doubt the worse professor I've ever had. She changes her grading rubric weekly. I am convinced she comes up with her own rules of the English language and grades your papers based on that. Avoid her at all costs.,0
"The class isn't that difficult if you just do the work, and take notes on the powerpoints by yourself. She goes pretty quick on the powerpoints during the class so I would recommend going through them on your own so that way you can understand better. Overall, she is a really nice person and is willing to give extra help when asked for.",1
This class is horrible and should not be taken by anyone other than insanely intelligent Science students --not Arts/Social Science friendly!,0
"Where do I begin with poor miss Thompson... Boring lectures, shes always complaining about how hot the classroom is, too serious, and she doesn't like when you ask questions during her lectures. TAKE ONLY IN MAYMESTER OR SUMMER!!!",0
"Worst Professor Ever. I didn't understand any of the lectures not even one of them. The midterm is all based on proof. I made a big mistake taking his class, I advise you to stay far away from his class. If you can, AVOID at all costs. He is simply a bad teacher. Also, the entire grade was just based on the midterm and the final.",0
"Do not take her class. It's unnecessarily difficult and she gives A LOT OF WORK  to do for no reason. I like her as a person, but her lecture is really... boring for the most part...",0
"I don't recommend at all. U will not know about nothing, unless you struggle by your self.",0
"Hunt is a very boring professor. She gives very organized power points but reads in such a monotone voice. As far as being a teacher she is okay, but as a person she doesn't seem to care about her students. She has a lot of pride and looks down on her students. Her exams are also more difficult than other professors.",0
"She is the absolute worst professor I have had yet, and I've been here a while.  She won't help you and then when she ""explains"" things you are more confused then whe you started because she just beats around the bush and then makes you feel stupid for asking.  Horrible Horrible Professor.  Switch your class if you get the chance.",0
"Avoid this professor,  tests are very wordy, so if English is your second language you will not get a good mark. If only she could bring her enthusiasm into her actual teaching abilities.",0
"Professor Dougherty is one of the toughest grades I have ever had at Moravian. Yes her class only have three ""short"" papers, a final paper and an optional final. But she will grade you'll paper extremely harsh and makes you use her ""revised"" apa format that she basically makes up and will give you a C if you cite anything incorrectly.",0
"If you're ok with paying $600 to read research papers, this class is for you. Weekly quizzes and assignments based on a paper. Midterm and final are also on a paper. Expectations are very unclear and lectures are fast, disorganized and very little useful information is ever provided. Worst class I've attended in three years at UBCO.",0
"Class could be a lot more clear. Seeman himself knows a lot and teaches really well, but clarity with grading could be improved. I was just pumped to get an A-. Just work really hard and talk to your TA.",0
His lecture is so boring but his tests are pretty easy. I just study at home on my own and get A+.  I would say that take his course if you want to raise your GPA.,0
"Mrs. Bolt is very knowledgeable about her field of study, that being said i would have to say she doesn't enjoy to teach. She grades extremely hard for a class that is suppose to be simple and it doesn't help that she is unorganized. Mrs. Bolt expects the world of her students but doesn't put in effort into the class",0
Keating marks you down on EVERY error on a paper. It is impossible to get an A on a paper unless you have 0 errors. Very anal and controlling and wants things his way.,0
"GREAT professor!  Best bussiness professor in bergen ccc. Very helpful, prepares u for the real world. Great sense of humor u won't fall asleep. Prepare for presentations, papers and group meeting. Great experience. He cares about the students. However don't get confuces! U have to study hard to pass this class.",1
"if you are a science major i highly recommend this prof, you will learn the material if you apply yourself, chemistry is not a class you cheat, you either learn it or not and avila puts you in position to succeed, do all the work requested and you will get a b, slack off and be lazy you won't do well, put the time in and an A is very attainable",1
"Dean Robiniwich is the best professor I hve ever had. I reccomend to take as many classes from him as you can. He is a huge part of the enviroment in the school, always welcoming and helpful. His classes are geared towards bar passage. He is friendly and helpful and makes this school a great place.",1
"I enjoy learning from Hansen. He clearly loves what he does, and although he can be slow at returning papers, you would be hard pressed to find an instructor more engaging or intelligent. Smartest person I know, not just in his field but in general. Easy to talk to, always willing to help his students. Highly recommended.",1
Prof Seaton is probably one of the best professors I've ever had. She really wants you to do well and learn the material and is very flexible in her teaching style. Lectures could be a little boring but assignments were easy and she was always there for you if you needed help. Would definitely take again!!,1
"Professor White's class is an easy A because she only has 3 tests (non cumulative) and they're all taken online and you don't have to take them in class. She also doesn't have to take attendance so if you're looking for an easy gen ed to take, this is a great one. ",1
"Gives us quizzes for homework. That's not the problem though, it is the fact that he doesn't teach well... at all. Complained to the department but they haven't done anything. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS.",0
She's not even a business teacher!,0
She does not stop lecturing the entire class. It's impossible to take notes because she goes way too fast. I had her for an hour and 15 minutes and it felt like she didn't even take a second to breathe. LECTURE ONLY. No type of interactive learning at all.,0
All I had to purchase was the access cose. Attending class helped a lot with the homework. Exam consisted of review questions. Review questions consisted of homework questions. In other words you had to do homework.,1
"Mr. Lloyd is quite outdated in his lengthy stories to be teaching this particular class. Never correct him when he gives incorrect information. He expects you to know where your classmates are, if they will be absent, or late. He won't start class until everyone is accounted for.  (This is our job as students?) Run, do not take him.",0
LONG exams! 150+ question exams. Yes he gives you the review a week before but the review itself is 200+ questions that you need to find the answers to and remember them. Unrealistic. Don't bother complaining he won't listen/care. Attendance is mandatory. You lose points for not coming to class. Jams 5 chapters in one test because he's unorganized.,0
Interesting teacher whom knows a lot about the subject matter. Also has lived the life of an Anthropologist so he talks from experience. If you do the readings ( the textbook is really interesting ).Phones are completely off limits. Pretty easy class to get a decent grade in that you show up and read the assigned readings.,1
"In my opinion, she is an awful professor. Her PowerPoints are garbage and the lectures are useless. You basically teach yourself the content. The course itself is fairly easy and it is easy to get a good mark if you put in the work, but students' success is entirely reliant on our self-teaching.",0
"Dr. Daigle is the best professor I have ever had! She is very intelligent and very kind. I would take her courses over and over again! I graduated with honors in 2005 thanks to this wonderful professor. Now I am obtaining my BSN in Nursing. Sincerely, Michelle Sutton",1
"The college is lucky to possess this fine young gentleman, educating the next leaders of the future!  I hope that he is well taken care of, not only financially, but as a highly respected educator of the residential district!",1
"AVOID THIS MAN AT ALL COSTS. He is the meanest, most arrogant professor I've ever had. He is not approachable. When you do talk to him, you will walk away feeling like the dumbest person alive. He is incredibly condescending and rude. His criticism is often unnecessarily CRUEL and unhelpful. He should be teaching grad students, NOT undergraduates.",0
"He talks at you, his questions to the class are 99% rhetorical.Gives take home multiple choice tests with multiple right answers per question, but he decides what the ""most right"" answer is. The class is not interactive, it's just his monologues. End of the class multiple difficult essays are due, with no homework before then that would help you.",1
"By far the worst teacher ever, granted he has no experience (was a TA & is an int'l student at GSU himself) but has horrible attitude. Just doesn't teach,reads through slides, unwilling to help, terrorizes students for asking questions. Purposefully makes life harder, expects you to know phd level stuff & will embarrass you if you said you didn't..",0
She was amazing,1
Very nice and easy,1
"I did not have her for a class, but I did choose to meet with her to go over my schedule for Fall. She was not friendly AT ALL and talked to me like I didn't do any research. I have known what I wanted to do with my life for so long and I understand it would not be easy, yet she discouraged me & told me i need to rethink my path. DO NOT TALK TO HER",0
"Great Professor!...Can't go wrong with this guy...Imagine a clash between Mr.Rogers (neighborhood) and Barney Fife...LOL..Very clear and easy to understand, tells you just what you need to know...he has you write 2 short papers and one medium research paper...there are weekly quizzes and the midterm/final exams are 1/2 MC & 1/2 Short Answer",1
"Fair enough, he's a nice guy but the contents of the course are BS. This class disguises religion as philosophy, and you need to treat myths like credible facts. There's a ton of reading and it's very difficult. he's a very tough grader on the in class writing, and the exam is brutal because i felt completely underprepared for it. not recommended!",0
She is incredibly unorganized. I will not take her again. She grades very strictly but does not teach very detailed. I never know what to study,0
"No extra credit, impossible exams and quizzes, wording is awful so you dont understand questions. doesnt want students do to well or curve, no one got a good grade.",0
"SHE IS AMAZING. She is and probably will be the best teacher Ive ever had at abbott. Her class is fun and and her humour makes it interesting. Study a bit, work for your grade just a little and I guarantee you will adore it. I had her for western civ and loved every class",1
"Dr. Kunz can be dry and lectures can be boring, but he knows this. Really sweet and wants you to do well. Would take him again!",1
"Looking back, i feel like the material for this class was way overcomplicated by Hines' teaching. He went way too fast and messed up more times than I could count while solving problems. I highly recommend going to Johnny Prints and picking up the slides used in class. Get ready to teach yourself this whole course.",0
"Horrible professor. Great about lecture and tips. Terrible at testing material, unclear on verbal instructions, and doesn't like lots of questions from students. Always advise to refer back to lectures and figure out the problem while I struggle. I wouldn't take her again. Never again! It hurts!",0
His teaching style is terrible.  Every time you ask a question he says you should have learned that in high school.  He goes out of his way to let you know that you are stupid.  If you love yourself you will not take this man for calculus.,0
Absolutely Horrible. Treats it like it's highschool. Rarely answers questions. Won't help you with anything in excel. Doesn't work with students. Leaves grading up to other people. Blinks too much and her only child is cat...Stay away from rankin if you value your G.P.A,0
"Horrible man in general. If you're trying to go to gradmedical school, this guy will ruin your GPA. 4.0 at CSUSM for a year and a half, and this guy gave me a C. Mean, condescending, rude, makes you feel stupid, and absolutely unapproachable in office hours. Won't tell you how to succeed. Do this at Palomar or Mira Costa, seriously, NOT MUSTARD.",0
"Overall a nice enough guy. Problem is his lectures are very dry, to say the least, and his grading mechanisms are quite flawed. You will more than likely be teaching yourself the material. The one good thing is what he teaches and gives in assignments is essentially the tests.",0
"She doesn't teach us anything. Every weekly class session she talks about her personal life, berates us for not knowing the material she isn't teaching us, and then if we ask her to explain the topics we are supposed to be learning she says ""that isn't her teaching style"". I'm changing majors because of this professors incompetence. AVOID HER",0
"Does not make art history interesting in the slightest. For each the midterm and final, she requires that we know the name, artist, and date of somewhere around 500 paintings; such a waste of brain space.",0
"This professor's office hours are extremely limited if you are looking to get extra help. However, if you somehow track him down for extra help in this course, you will not feel respected for he had uncalled for political jabs and degrades your work and thinking process.  Prof. Rogers clearly does not believe in the success of his students.",0
"only offers his class at 8:10 in the morning every quarter...so when I drag myself to class at that time I at least expect some sort of interaction, some interest. larry wright won't give it to you. he mumbles so its hard to understand him. grading scale is abnormal and he isn't much help at all!",0
"Derek Levine is an asset to The College of Staten Island. Non-stop learning without any hassle or roadblocks. This professor is a genius and I could listen to him all day long. He ""gets it"" and will pass it along to you. I highly recommend.",1
She is one of the greatest professors I ever had! She explains material clearly and very simulated. I love being in her class. Not a single day that I want to miss her class!,1
"Dr. lyall is amazing and very funny. His lectures are so informative and interesting. His lectures are filled with great practical concepts. Just be aware you must complete chapter summaries, although the book is interesting. You must also submit two interview videos. I looked forward to every lecture. I love the way he teaches. ",1
"Interesting subject but very scattered and biased method of teaching. Barely took any notes. Weekly 1pg response papers due, 4 unit papers (only have to do 3), optional final, 6 pop quizzes drops the lowest. If you muddle through the not always pleasant reading material and incorporate the ""4 key concepts"" in your writing then you should be fine.",1
"Witch in West World is easy once you realize you dont need to do the readings. NO tests/quizzes. Grades come from research projects/presentations that you can do w/o a lot of class knowledge. The topics are interesting, but the readings were so much for a c100 and I got an A w/o doing 90% of em. She helps you improve public speaking tremendously",1
"Professor McCarthy was one of my favorite teachers this semester, she made the class fun and genuinely cares about her students. She leans on the tougher side of grading, but she gives out clear rubrics and good feedback. There's a lot of readings and short homework (like reviews) in this class but if you do them you'll have no problems at all.",1
"I don't know why so many people have Dr. McCartney so highly rated. If you have her for Tsem drop it, hardest class I've taken ever. 5 mandatory novels to read and she assigns so much work that she can't get it graded and returned. Aweful class all around",0
Celia is an extremely tough prof. As a science student who is used to getting a lot of work-don't be fooled she gives a LOT of homework. She is really strict and for some reason thinks no one in the class studies and puts in effort while everyone is struggling and crying. I think I've had maybe 3-4 nice cry sessions from her class. Not worth it.,0
She is still employed at CCRI. She is still difficult and she still threatens students to leave good feedback on this site. Difficult woman. Good luck to you if she is your clinical instructor.,0
"VERY NICE TEACHER. GIVES A LOT OF NOTES AND A LOT OF MATERIAL TO STUDY FOR THE TEST, BUT GIVES HINTS ON WHAT WILL BE ON THEM. EXPLAINS AND CLARIFIES THINGS IF YOU DONT UNDERSTAND. VERY PLEASANT WOMAN",1
"My experience was that there was too little clarity or teaching of concepts. Again again we had to struggle on our own and a lot of students just ended up failing because they felt disconnected and could do nothing about it. He picks his favorites and assumes others too lazy or and do not want to put in the work. Its not hard, its the teaching.",0
"She is a sweet lady. I feel like we only did like 5 essays all semester. We only did like 1 or 3 assignments on the book,so your efforts on your essay will reflect on your  final grade. I wish she would have handed back our essays with feedback, so that I would have known what I needed to improve on. Overall, I got an A in the class.",1
"I had over 100 credit hours when I took her class and it was enough to make me consider dropping out. It was the worst college experience I've ever had. You'll pour days of your life into the project and be proud of the result. But regardless, she'll be offended by your efforts and tear every piece you turn in to shreds with no guidance provided.",0
"I loved Michelfelder!!  Her lectures are long, but also VERY HELPFUL, you have to write a lot but she makes tests directly from the notes. She helps students when you ask and is not intimidating at all so don't be afraid to ask for help. Gave a couple opportunities for extra credit throughout the semester  would totally take a class of hers again",1
"She is clear about the topic, but the homework is difficult. Gives a lot of homework. Is very strict on deadlines, and will not give a second opportunity. I have no desire to take her again. ",1
"This professor likes to show off how much she knows about everything. Be prepared to hear a lot of stories about herself. Be prepared to teach yourself, this woman is a joke.",0
"Coming from high school, I was scared of college level spanish. he turned out to be the easiest prof I've had thus far. participate and show interest in what he's teaching and he'll love you. Talk to him on a regular basis in Span. If you ask questions on tests, he gives you answers (if he likes you).",1
"Absolutely the most amazing teacher, she genuinely cares about her students and their success. She does not try to trick you or make things difficult. She is extremely responsive to your needs and questions. I wish she taught more classes.",1
"I took the half-semester version, so I had a 3 hour lecture twice a week from him. He gave a good break and I never got tired of him. He is Romany so he has an accent but it's ok to understand 99% of the time. He loves students who participate and ask questions. His office hours are helpful and he will go over a paper with you no problem at all!",1
"Frankie is one of the best math teacher I have ever had.  She is a very easy grader, by that I mean she wants to give you as much points as she can.  Her quizzes are easy. Also, she doesn't grade homework but it would help you a lot in her tests.",1
"A very nice man, but, he really needs to keep political views out of class.I don't care if your views agree with mine or not. I'm paying 14 grand a year to learn, not to hear a bunch of political propaganda. Any person that starts a class with the number of deaths in the current war isn't right in the head. Oh,and reading the material for tests, an",0
"An enthusiastic teacher. He tries to make sure everyone understands the material and is very helpful in office hours. He does rush at times. His test are easy if you do the hw however, the material for phys331 is difficult. THe only way to pass is to keep up with the readings and lectures. Compared to other phys profs he is slightly above average.",1
"She one time deducted 30 points from my friend's grade because he was staring off into space during one of our 75 billion guest speakers, and he tried to explain to her he has ADHD and Aspergers and she said he would have to make up his grade with other assignments at a later date.",0
"He answers all our questions although sometimes they were basic questions. The tests were okay but very limited time, so we had to practice to get used to it. Solid professor.",1
Mrs. Kondrak is a good teacher it's just that she is monotoned. He voice does not change and she is BORING.,0
"The presentations were very clear and easy to understand, and had almost everything you needed for the test. He also gave very helpful non-graded practice quizzes to prepare you for tests. Grades based on 4 tests and a short research paper. Professor Gaidos seemed very nice and funny. He definitely gave you everything needed to be successful.",1
"Although you learn some cool technology uses, the environment in the classroom was awful. He'll constantly go off topic on things unrelated to class making the class feel longer than it already is. He constantly yells, get frustrated and impatient to any student wanting to ask questions or clarification and overall an unpleasant person. STAY AWAY!",0
"Great Ideas in Mathematics was one of the worst classes I've taken at NYU. This is not a class for people who like/understand math, but Clarkson doesn't care. She barely explained these very complex theories and when she did, I was left more confused. Homework was extraordinarily hard and went beyond class work. Don't take this class!",0
Perez rocks. His class can be a little confusing at times but if you get clarity with him and visit him during office hours you will get an A. The paper you write will be a semester long process but visiting him and working on it will pay off in the long run.,1
"Hands down favorite professor. She taught me so much and got me interested in the news and political events. She has her views on things and she is willing to fight for them. Gives lots of extra credit, gives attendance points, she gives you outlines for each chapter so learn the outline and skim the chapters in the book. You'll  get an A.",1
grades too hard,0
"One of the worst at GV. She's very smart and knowledgeable, but she has no clue how to teach. She goes over everything once and expects you to master it. The tests are hard and there is little time to write the paper. She laughed in my face once when I asked a question. She made SPSS more confusing than it actually is. 1/5th of my class dropped out",0
"She is the best! The sweetest lady you will ever meet. If you just pay attention, show up, don't break he rules, and do the homework you will get and A. Take her!",1
Very good teacher.  If you work hard in his class you will do well because he wants you to earn your degree.,1
"SL is a waste of time, Bude is a really nice teacher, but the class is terrible. I wouldn't mind doing the 30 hours of Community service but you also have weekly readings and forums which is tedious for a 2 unit class, then they want to shove PC down your throat.  Don't select MATE SL site. SL doesn't do anything CS related. Take KIN SL instead.",1
"My favorite professor at St. Joe's :) You really need to pay attention and take notes, but he doesn't butcher us with homework. We only have a presentation and term paper at the end of the class, both of which he is happy to help with. He's super approachable and funny. Definitely take him!",1
Kildea is awesome. Makes class fun with really funny and witty comments. Always there to help you if you need anything. Doesn't require a textbook.,1
Take this class if you have to take psych and its not important to your major. Easy A if you do the paper. You dont really have to do good on the paper. She scaled all of our quizzes since everyone scored so low (no one got above a 70). If you really care about psych and want to learn it. Then do not take this class because you wont learn,0
"All of these negative reviews are exaggerated. Yes, it's a difficult class, and he isn't the most ""warm and fuzzy"" guy. Nonetheless, he's very fair with his expectations and you learn A LOT. His priority is preparing you for the CPA exam, which is much more difficult than this course. If you put in the time you'll be fine; it's not rocket science.",1
"Mike has very long lectures, it seems like they drag on forever, but if you pay attention you will be okay! There isn't homework except for blackboard quizzes about once a week maybe twice. Make sure you study for the exams, look over powerpoints, he puts all the notes on blackboard!",1
"This class with Alynn was great! She marks very fair,  gives good feedback, and is willing to help individual students with anything they need help with. I would highly recommend her class to anyone!",1
No.,0
Would not recommend unless you're a freshmen. The class was a dread to go to and kind of annoying because it was a waste of time but it was extremely easy.,0
"Dr. Hwang is not the greatest professor. He speaks very broken English and is condescending towards many students because their beliefs differ from his. He spends most of the time lecturing about material that is not even on his tests. I would show up though, he sometimes gives extra credit to those who show up.",0
Dr. Wisotzki is a great professor. Definitely take her before leaving Loyola. She is brilliant and her lectures are interesting. You will want to go to class!,1
"He literally tells you exactly what he wants in your essays. Do what he says and you'll get an A. Sometimes he even gives you a thesis and tells you to fill in the blanks so you don't have to worry about it. If you ask him for help, he'll gladly give it. He clearly wants us to do well in the rest of our college english classes.",1
"Graham should never be able to teach a college class again. If you want your GPA to get bent over then take his class. If you want someone who just expects you to learn everything on your own then take Graham, everyone I talked to from my class was also failing all quarter long. Terrible lectures and he has 0 care about your effort for your GPA.",0
His way or the highway.  Not my way.,0
"Definitely hardest professor for comp sci. Grader takes million years to return work. Professor does not give feedback so go whole semester without knowing grade. Assignments are confusing and professor often makes mistakes in directions, often updates directions. Have to start early. Exams very difficult. Grades A or F, not give partial credit.",0
I took his CIST 1305 summer class and he didn't even get to teach us Python. The most I know about programming is the basics of flow charts ,0
"I took a women in politics class that involved a lot of reading out of about 6 books throughout the semester. I worked really hard in her class and pulled an A, but only because I showed up, participated in discussions and spent a substantial amount of time on my homework. You definately get what you put into this course.",1
He was a great Prof. he was interesting and a bit of a goofball at times. There were alot of notes but we could use the book for things. I loved his class!,1
She is a very lazy teacher. Did not respond to questions in a timely manner. Takes forever to grade her papers. Makes you write an 8 page research paper (APA Style).,0
i love mis magdaleno she is the best teacher i have this semester =] i wont her for my color fundamentals class!!,1
She is the worst teacher ever! Sucks you have to take this crap!,0
"Make sure not to turn in assignments late, he's very tranquil, just do the work and you'll pass with an A - C (depending on your writing skills).",1
"Dr. A is a great guy. He is very smart, but his lectures are HARD. Spatial Analysis is impossible. BUT there is a HUGE curve if you actually try hard. Taking notes in class makes no difference. Just don't get behind on studying. Takes attendance 10x at random so go to class. DO problem sets and go on extra credit labs.",0
"Sa Signature:Écologiste humaniste altermondialiste coopérativiste postcapitaliste. Si vous préférez un cours où l'idéalisme prend un second rôle derrière la réalité, voir ailleurs. De plus, sa plus grande exigence est la présence, donc c'est pas un gage de haut niveau.",0
She is the scariest professor you will ever take. Not very negotiable nor very nice and doesn't treat students with respect. BUT the plus side to this as mean as she is she is a VERY good teacher. All my friends complain about not understanding accounting but I do because of her teaching style. You will have to work for the A.,1
AVOID HIM AT ALL COST. Do not take his class you will regret it for sure.,0
"Great Professor, a tough grader but fair. He gives great lectures, is very helpful, and provides many interesting insights. His classes are hard but certainly not impossible. Just do the reading, participate a little, and ask questions. I will say that I probably would have not enjoyed his class as much if I was not liberal.",1
"A literal genius. You will learn a lot in this class. You will also spend a lot of time reading and doing graded work. Homeworks can be difficult, but if you understand them you can do relatively well on the tests. VERY LONG TESTS. Multiple parts with short answer, graphs, essays, and MC questions. Good guy, and very inspiring. But be ready to work",1
"Professor Cintron is experienced, knowledgeable, and caring. I have taken a few classes with her and enjoyed them all. She genuinely wants students to learn and to feel prepared for real world applications. She is warm and friendly and listens to student feedback. She cares and it shows. If you want to learn, take her class.",1
"Most of the class time is spent listening to him talk about himself, which seems to be the only reason he came out of retirement to teach. He includes a page long resume/biography about himself on his syllabus. You have to keep track of your classmates, and report on their whereabouts to the entire class, which takes about half the class.",0
"Overall, I would say that he is a decent teacher. My downfall in the class was attendance. You do receive an attendance grade and trust me when I say it will affect your final grade. I would've had an A if I would've came to class more often. Sometimes he will get off topic, but he has a good sense of humor.",1
"This class ran off of connect with 3 assignments plus a quiz each but ALSO a ""project"" (busy work) to go along with each week. The directions for these project were never clear and you basically had to guess on the internet and hope and pray you received a decent grade from the TA and even then the professor may come and change it !",0
"She's Great Clear and to the point, breaks material down so you understand, stresses what pts you'll need  to no for test mutiple choice & matching only Gives realistic examples and has a Great sense of Humor She's so AWESOME that I'm taking her again for BI 152 Easy A as long as YOU apply Yourself",1
She is nice but unprepared. Most students are confused and remain confused at end of class. Expectsyou to read and understand content before teaching it. Gives homework and a lot of power points.  You feel you are doing all the work alone.  In clinical she expect you to be an experienced nurse.,0
"Advanced Swim class was AWESOME! If you know what you're doing and know how to swim, it's a piece of cake. A couple online modules, but they're easy. Richard is an amazing swimmer too. Take this class!",1
"Mr Boehm is an awesome professor. He was helpful with ALL of the questions I had. Laid back and made it fun to be in his class. I've never liked English classes, but he made it fun to do.",1
"Had Mr. Petro Summer 08, great teacher. It's a tough course. Do your homework and you'll be fine. He'll help you as much as possible ( he gives extra credit on tests ). Don't blame him for the tough course work.",1
Pretty hard Professor. She taught the plant section of BIS2C and her midterms and section on the final were rough. She does test on the smallest details sometimes. She has pretty good lectures if you can listen. Extremely knowledgeable on the topics and respected. Great sense of humor too. Just wish her tests weren't so detailed.,1
"The man is a jerk... yeah, he's intelligent and you might learn a little, but he's constantly saying the opposite of his notes and the text book, and he's so arrogant that if you try to say something he doesn't know he throws a fit. Always talks about how wonderful he is and he's insensitive and unhelpful.",0
"Claudine was a wonderful instructor! She gives clear expectations, is easy to communicate with, and genuinely cares about her students. She loves mental health and it's easy to see. You'd be lucky to have her!",1
"I took her online class and loved it. I thought she was extremely thorough in everything. Her exams were extremely difficult... it seemed however that it was weighed because I ended up getting an A in the class when it should have been a B (per the points). Regardless of the difficulty of her tests, it is all for a reason and she is a great prof.",1
Awesome professor! Very sweet and understanding! Interesting lectures. Fun class. Highly recommend!,1
"If you are a weak math student, do not take this course with Ostry. His lectures are boring and not interactive. He does not provide assignments to keep you on track throughout the semester, and the text is hard to understand without supplemental material. As many people before have said, take it with Amsel.",0
"Worst math teacher i ever had. She often gets confused and has to refer to her notes. She cant answer questions, barely speaks english, and can NOT teach. Avoid this woman at all costs",0
"I had already taken Chem before and I skipped Chem151 to take this class. His lectures are EXTREMELY dull, and I spent most of the time taking my own notes on the exact lecture he was lecturing on for 3.5 hours. Exams were easy for me, but any questions I had were not answered well, and it seemed like he never understood how to answer a simple one.",1
"Despite getting the highest grade on all of the exams (90 avg), I still almost made a C in the class because of pop quizzes. Asks extremely specific questions and sometimes counts AGAINST you for getting it wrong. Burghardt is laughably condescending. You'd think you're talking to a celebrity with how self-important he is. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS",0
"Belzile is one of the worst at LU he was useless, demanding, and does not respect his students",0
She is very nice and knows a lot about photography. I entered the class already having proficient knowledge about photography but still learned a lot and went on to take Photo II. She isn't a harsh grader and she makes her expectations clear. Happy I took this class.,1
"Great humor. Always gives you honest advice if you need it. She's a motivating person and works hard with her students as opposed to just watching them. Honestly, I love her.",1
"Mr. Henson is the greatest biology teacher. He loves the students and loves what he does. He has passion for the subject and cares about you as a person. He does not give you the grade, you earn it.",1
she knows her material but she's absolutely horrible at teaching. makes you pay for webassign and gives test/quiz problems that she has never gone over. horrible at explaining answers to questions that you have.,0
"If you're looking to fail math, she's your teacher! She's probably a nice person, but she's a horrible teacher. She assumes everyone in the class has already taken the course in a previous school or something.Relies on MathXL to teach, lots and lots of MathXL. If I wanted to teach myself math, I would have just bought a textbook.",0
This class has been the worst class that Ive ever taken Prof tests on the concepts he barely spends time explaining throughly you are essentially on your own when it comes to tests. The labs are also bad he expects you to know all the lab material and literally comes into lab just to ask you questions and if you dont get them he roasts you.,0
"Always dreaded going to his class. Not helpful when you dont understand something. Pynn was an overall nice and funny person, but as a professor, I do not recommend AT ALL. Your grade depends on 4 tests that are not multiple choice. He grades extremely harsh and is not understanding nor caring towards his students whatsoever.",0
"Visiting professor but is here for at least 2 quarters. Very interested in the topics of global diasporas obviously, could have been clearer with what he was looking for on midterm (aka unclear why you got what grade you got) but he was approachable and obviously knowledgable. 2 quizzes, midterm, final paper. Take him if you get the chance!",1
"She is not a very good teacher. She just agrees with what the students say and her tests are the most stupid thing in the world.  It is almost ridiculous to sit through her class.  If you miss a quiz you're screwed, and she will not let you make it up.  Don't take her class.  She may be a cool person but if you want to learn or do well, avoid her.",0
She is unrealistic when it pertains to grading. Her Environment class felt like 3 classes. Beware.. She has no life and expects us to have days worth of conversation in our discussions. yeah she knows her studies but she'll take all the motivation out of you.,0
"I never took this dude, but he wrote our class final. He gave us his old tests to ""prepare"" for it (without solutions) and there was only one or two questions that were similar.  The stuff on our final was NEVER covered in our class, MLP, or on our quizzes/tests. Kind of an D-head move to make someone else's final impossible to prepare for...",0
"I attended every class, participated actively in discussions, did all the readings and assignments completely and on time.  Gives little feedback so it's hard to tell if you're not doing well.  If she doesn't like you personally it will have a negative effect upon your grade.  Do not recommend.",0
Professor Maher is by far the worst professor I have ever had at Missouri State University. He is not willing to help you in any way. Tests are completely short answer. First exam was 5 front and back pages of short answer statistic problems to do in only 50 minutes. Would NEVER recommend.,0
Professor Mantell grades based on weekly discussions and the midterm and final. Her class actually stopped a month before regular classes ended. She is very nice and I would definitely take her again!,1
"TERRIBLE PROFESSOR!! didn't give me feedback on my paper after emailing her MULTIPLE times. Forcing me to put quotation marks on a sentence that is ORIGINAL and MINE!!!  How does umb even hire such professors, I just don't get it. After putting in ALL my hours into this course I got a B- !!! Seriously avoid ",0
She has a deadline at 8pm instead of 11:59 pm like everyone else. She also doesn't explain assignments well. So far we've wasted about 3 classes for one assignment. There's a trivia that we had to cite. Who does a trivia with citation?,0
do not recommend her,0
The quizzes were unnecessarily difficult and discouraging. The lecture slides were only a summary and to do well on the exam you were expected to kind of memorize every paragraph of the textbook just in case.,0
"Midway through semster, our class was changed to a hybrid format. no more lectures. we would show up to class for 30 min. very pointless. seemed like prof lost interest in the class altogether. we stopped receiving study guides for exams and he never went in detail over any chapters.",0
Kathleen is absolutely amazing and so inspiring she makes me want to be an animator. What makes her advice more genuine is that she worked on so many movie s like Pocahontas and Tarzan. Everyone was genuinely excited and loved coming to class Can't wait to take her other two classes.,1
Awesome first year class. Hope to have her again in the future.,1
I was a bit scared since I am not a photo major. But i do really enjoyed her class. Her canvas is very organized. She sent out weekly reminders for your to-dos that week and she gives big extra credit assignments. The tests are a bit heavy and require you to learn a lot of information. But all other assignments are pass/no pass! Take her !!,1
"mollie gave us a very clear description as to what to expect when we decide to become ag teachers. I feel like she does a very good job at giving us the reality of being an ag teacher. class met once a week for about three hours, we never actually used up the three hours until near the end of the semester. makes it very clear that shes a mom first",1
Participation is the key to your success in this class.,1
"admirable, knowledgable, funny instrutor. She is so emotional that she never hurts anybody by giving a lower than C grade. easy midterm and final. she was busy grading papers during class section, so you are free to do anything.",1
"Dylan Shields is one of the BEST professors in the Cinema Dept. I took him for editing, advanced editing and Cinema Business. I got A's in all of the classes. He's really easy going, easy to talk to and very lenient with deadlines. The editing projects are fun and you spend hours doing them. Time to be creative! Fun class, fun professor! Easy A!",1
I absolutely admire him so much. He's a really great guy and the class was not even that hard. All you do is do your assignments and boom you'll have a passing grade. The only thing is that there are 4 exams and you only need to pass 3/4 and they are a bit rough but you have time to prepare and you have his lectures so its time consuming but okay.,1
"Dr. Wildman is an amazing professor, easily one of the best at SFCC, and his class is a lot of fun. I personally didn't get along with him, though. Whenever I sought help, he made me feel as if I was wasting his time. I've never experienced this problem with any other professor. I was never rude and never felt deserving of his borderline neglect.",1
He is my favorite professor! He is very intelligent and knows how to catch everyone's attention in class. His way of teaching is the best. You won't regret taking him.,1
"Really informed teacher;very easy to follow in class.  Clearly defines requirements, sends reminder e-mails, and is always accessible for further assistance outside the classroom...take her class!",1
"I love this man. He's a gem. He's incredibly knowledgable and clearly passionate about what he teaches! I understand that he speaks slowly, which many people find boring, but I think it gives more depth to the content, since it makes you slow down and think about what he's saying. I like his style. Please be nice and show him some respect.",1
"without those extra bonuses credits , we won't survive the class. thank you very much dr. Randy Waterman.",1
"Loved her and she really does make you work for it, but in a great way. Astronomy is my favorite subject and it should be a requirement to take this class. She made me feel so special by reminding me of how lucky I am to be on Earth. I didn't need this class for a requirement, I took it for my own love of our universe. Thanks, professor Walker! ",1
This class is the most difficult online class I've ever taken. There's quizzes for every chapter which isn't the problem it's how hard the quizzes are. They are full of trick questions and the book tricks you as well. I failed at least 2 quizzes every time and you can only take them once which is not fair considering how hard they are. DONT TAKE,0
"Took online Summer of 2019. He provides materials, no need to buy the book. Seems like a very down to earth guy but I never reacevied the grading for two out of four papers. Papers also were the only thing we did in class over summer. Had a paper due every Friday final included. Four papers only so do them to pass!",1
Mrs. Hayden helped me come out of my shell and be more comfortable with public speaking. She is very helpful with your speeches. You will use your book to learn things and have quizzes over certain chapters. I can say that I was nervous to take this class but it was actually fun.,1
"Attendance is mandatory. His teaching style is boring, honestly I'm not learning much from his lectures.",0
"Currently in her class during the coronavirus. Although some teachers lighten up on homework during this pandemic, she doubled it for us. I know we have a lot of time on our hands, but an eight hundred points essay and a thousand points essay are too much on us students who is stressed about the times going on outside of the world and in their home",0
Horrible student feedback relationship experiences when typing up poorly written via e-mail communications; stumbles upon discussion entry assignments marking off participation points (penalizing students for mistakes); limited availability outside of classroom environment; and final essay exam must be completed for achieving full accredited units.,0
"Harland is hands down the best instructor at the u of m. He gives great homework, lectures, and tests are quite fair. Always responds to emails promptly and with detail. It is calculus so expect to work for it, but you can easily finish with an good mark with a bit of effort. I highly recommend this instructor.",1
"Never responds to posts or questions. Had assignments in the syllabus that I spent 4+ hours a week on and she never even opened them, later found out that she has it in there but does not grade them, of course found this out after week 5 or 6 of 8. Lazy as all get out, takes her sweet time getting grades back to you. Easy grading though.",0
"My class was Online, prof Conner's super caring , and she took time to assure my understanding. It would be better to work with her in person because at least the communication barrier isn't there. Do your homework, study, and call her if you have ANY QUESTIONS or concerns and she will definitely help you to pass !",1
Currently studying for this final and I really don't think I'm gonna make it. At 2 on the dot he walks in dims the lights and begins lecture for the entire class time. He is not good at lecturing and makes no effort to get students engaged. His voice is monotone so it's easy to zone out. He seams like a good guy but the class is a struggle.,0
"It seems most people have given up on him. Class is 16/35 full, people keep dropping out, and in the online lectures you'd be lucky to find 9-10 people attending. That should tell you everything about him. Listen to these reviews people.",0
Loves what she teaches and it shows in every class! She makes an early class worth getting up for. The work load is not overwhelming but start project early so you can have work reviewed before submission. Look forward to taking another class with Prof. Buchoff!,1
I hate him with a passion. Don't take him. He sucks.,0
"Terrible, Does not want to help you.  He talks down to you if you don't understand what he is teaching.  He goes around in circles and forgets what hes talking about.  Save yourself from this class.  I should have.",0
"Professor Kanchi's Cloud Computing class is awful. The lecture material doesn't cover the topics you need to know in order to succeed in the lab, she frequently doesn't respond to emails and has difficulty picking up on questions. Much of the material she provides for the lab is both erroneous and out of date. To do well, you need to find a student",0
Easy class but you are 100% on your own. She never responded to any of my emails or phone calls. I even emailed the administrator trying to get ahold of her. She sets up her online class with automatic test results and does nothing else.,0
Shes a great person but she doesn't seem to grasp that as a student you have other classes to take. By far the most amount of homework I've ever had since high school. She really shouldn't be a history professor and should consider english since she is more concerned with interpreting the author then history itself. Don't take if you are a fulltime,0
"If you are genuinely passionate and interested in psychology, this is a great class. The professor wrote the textbook for crying out loud. Taking it as an online class it is very self-directed obviously. Every communication or email received by the professor was pleasant.",1
"I took her for approaches to Literature. She is mean, unless you agree with her feminist agenda. I have to give her credit though, she was on a grading committe who changed my grade, so I give her a little credit for that.",0
"Basically just reads of PowerPoint slides. Tests/Projects/HWs are extremely easy. Very accessible outside of class + very caring towards all students. He is glad to help you any time. The class would be better if he taught more advanced stuff, wouldn't just read off slides, and make us learn more contemporary Java frameworks.",0
"Not a difficult class, does not take attendance but homework is due every class. He is funny and really easygoing. There were 4 tests and a final. Grading scale is a bit weird but it is an easy philosophy credit. Ehring has a dry sense of humor but he made me laugh so hard I was almost crying! I want to take I'm for intermediate logic.",1
"This is an easy class. Shes very passionate about her job but tries too hard to create friendly connections with her students. This can be a bit annoying at times as she goes on long tangents. This feels nothing short of a highschool English class. Get ready to pass, its hard not to.",0
"Miller is an extremely tough teacher. I mean this in the nicest way possible, but his voice is extremely hard to tolerate. Your final grade is composed of 4 exams that are not similar to the ridiculous amount of optional homework that he assigns.  He's also not helpful when asked questions. Our class always went over by 15 mins. Do not recommend.",0
"Mr. Gallegos provided everything he could for students to really explore the jobs within the major students wanted to do, as well with majors for students based on their personality and morals. Gives homework, but its so easy. Just fill in blank get it from book gives you 2 weeks to complete. lectures arent heavy there very fun.",1
"I really enjoyed his class, and wasn't expecting to. He was a great teacher, engaged, flexible, and encouraging. He challenged me to help me grow and learn. He's got the stuff that great teachers are made of.",1
Would not take again. Very unorganized !,0
"Maybe for the English language courses she's worth it, but not for any Spanish language courses. This woman can not even pronounce certain spanish words incorrectly. She needs to stick to political feminist college classes in english rather than intelligent spanish classes.",0
"I took professor Renner through the pandemic and I can easily say she was the worst professor I've met at IU. At the beginning of the semester, she clearly told us she wasn't a ""teacher"", just a ""score keeper"". She hardly knows how to use Canvas, and was not understanding of her students at all. If math is not your best subject, like me, good luck.",0
not a good teacher avoid at all cost. oh believe me..,0
clearly he is writing his own feedback on here. sitting in front won't help. going to innovation lab or slc was only way I could understand it. not helpful. kept saying right... like everyone one understood what he head just said and the room sat there confused and shaking heads as he kept talking... get ready to hear him talk nonstop...,0
"I found this instructor to be infuriating! Her personality & teaching techniques leave a lot to be desired. She does not take into consideration that most students taking DE math are generally not good with math to begin with & she offers them no assistance or encouragement. In addition, the amount of homework & quizzes for her class is ridiculous.",0
Best professor I have ever had in my entire life!  Took him for both 351 and 352,1
"I didn't mind Dr. Lim as much until the final.  I've gotten higher than 95 on all my homework, A's on both of my midterm and 100 on the semester project, and I left finals with an overall of B-....... The 3 hours exam was so freaking hard, I didn't finish in 4 hours... and trust me, I studied my ass of for that class. so good lucj if you take him.",0
Helps when you need help. But sometimes annoying when he wants things in only one specific way.,1
Probably my favorite class i took one semester. Professor Candida really cares about her students and is passionate about disability. Many in class lectures however they were engaging and interesting. Attend and participate and you'll have a good time as well as an A.,1
"Prof Dietrich is awesome.  I'm not real math oriented, and she does give homework almost every class, but she can teach.  I am taking the class now and I have learned more in a few weeks than I did in 2 semesters here.  If you come to class and do the work YOU WILL LEARN!  I highly recommend her.  She makes a boring subject pretty interesting!",1
Honestly the course is challenging but I love this professor. If you go to class and do most of the reading than  you should be fine. If you go to his office hours he is very helpful he will answer questions and even take the time to help u grasp the content wether it's with helping link my flash cards together with the time period and terms or just plain explaining it to me he was very helpful. Great teacher if u like a little challenge take him!,1
She is a nightmare. She is so vague and her lectures are extremely boring. She gives assignments at the last minute with very little explanation. She is very disorganized so you never know when things are due or what is expected of you. She is also very inaccessible and useless if you need help.,0
"give low really grade on lab report although u have 20 pages, barely can hear him, never ever c/p someone's work on ur report even though u only use  5% out of ur entire work, he considers it's cheating, and report to university. over all he is easy but mean.",0
Very aggressive,0
My high school teachers were more organized and able to communicate the information clearly. This was suppose to be a bridge/orientation class. All we did was listen to people talk and fill out worksheets. No campus tour so you know where everything is. Stay away from this professor and class if you don't need to take it.,0
"Extremely condecending.  Extremely fast and just rushes through everything. All geades come from 4 tests and a final, no homework, no participation, no extra credit points. Grades test Extremely hard giving little to no partial credit.",0
"This man is a real gem. He is by far the best anthro professor on this campus and one of the best professors in general. He always makes class interesting and enjoyable. He makes you work for your grade, but if you show effort you'll be fine. He is one of the nicest people ever and is always ready to listen if you have a problem. 100% recommend.",1
WORST CLASS AND PROFESSOR I'VE EVER HAD - HE DOESN'T TEACH AT ALL. AVOID THIS CLASS.,0
"In my opinion, she took a ridiculous amounts of points for items graded and was clearly unfair in her grading.  Her grading comments were very unclear. An example, post 2 responses for discussion boards to meet the minimum requirements. The she takes a point because you only posted two.  How can you take points for meeting requirements?",0
"Mrs. Aida-Brown is a good professor. I had her online Nutrition class and it was decently easy. You will have to purchase Mindtap from Cengage in order to partake in the class ($100). All of the assignments are very easy and she gives you ample amount of time to work on them. If you do everything you're supposed to, you'll get an A. Guaranteed.",1
"This professor tries to make sure that you understand the material. However, the homework is harder than it is on the quizzes and he gives either 2 or 1 chances on the homework. As long as you don't skip class too much and you really focus on the lectures and you know the material from calculus I really well, this class is not too bad.",1
"I had Dr. Tiwari for Physics and Alg./Trig. This guy is probably the coolest professor on the campus. Last summer (2004), he protested in Charlotte about the war in Iraq, and was on the news for it! That's the kind of guy he is. You can literally go up to",1
"The only reason why I would say to take him is the curve. He is rude and mean. And his exams are way easier compared to the other professors. However, I really think he has anger issues. If you get close to him though, I heard he warms up. CURVE CURVE CURVE though.",1
"Very unorganized. Starts an exercise and makes mistakes frequently. I took his summer class for Calculus 1, if you don't get distracted by someone moving and writing in the blackboard without any order, you'll get an A. Says homework is not mandatory but asks for it after each exam.",0
"Dr. Rumenik means well, but sadly, she misses the mark on being an efficient professor. She knows Psychology material but is not great at teaching it to others. She takes ridiculously long pauses in between sentences, takes an excessive amount of time to answer emails, and goes off on tangents constantly. Also, she lacks up to date tech knowledge.",0
One of the most disrespectful professors I've ever had. She sent my whole class an email at the end of the semester telling us how bad we all did and pretty much saying it's all our fault and not hers. I've always been a good paper writer and got C's on all of hers. Wouldn't recommend.,0
"He's really strict with attendance and being on time, so be careful with that. The assignments are 100% writing, and what he wants you to say isn't always obvious, but his office is always open for questions.",1
"Soc 101 with Reynolds was a greeat class! He gives extra credit and will actually help you get a better grade if he sees you are trying and gives study guides. He is a very sweet and caring person and truly cares for all of his students. You do have to write a few papers, but as long as you follow his criteria, it isn't that hard to accomplish.",1
"Jayne has a great knowledge base when it comes to nursing. If you have her for lecture, you will have no problem. If you have her for clinical, however, she is very intimdating, belittling, and angry. Many students have literally felt emotionally traumatized after having her. She will make you feel like you are incompetent and worthless.",1
She is a sweetheart. She wants everyone to love her class. She can be confusing with her assignments. A lot of group work.,1
"Hard work pays off in every class except for this one. If you can't sleep during the night, show up to his class and he will put you to sleep with his lectures. If you can't read, no need to worry because he will read the powerpoint slides for you for the entire class.",0
She is one of the best professors in Howard CC. I have had 23 professors in HCC and she is one of my TOP 5.,1
I really enjoyed the course. It was hard to get used to at first (taking notes for an hour just based on what he says) but definitely worth it. He truly knows his stuff and makes it funny and interesting. I dont usually like history courses but I really enjoyed this one. 3 tests (based on underline content from outlines in class) & 2 essays.,1
"This class is a great course for those that struggle with math. If you do not understand the material, just ask questions. He has review days and tells you the sections that you will be tested on. 5 tests and the lowest will be dropped, no quizzes. Patient, but serious. Don't laugh and goof off or he will kick you out. He's chill though.",1
She is so hott and has a very interesting class. You can't beat that! She is kind of difficult but overall not bad. She will let you know exactly what she wants and if you don't complete your assignment then it's tough luck! I recommend this class to anyone that wants a fun Composition class.,1
****er droped me from his class becasue he had a retarted senior who needed it,0
"This man is one of the best teacher I ever had. When he was teaching, it was just like he was typing down everything he knows on my brain. Great teaching style. Provides extra helpful sources. If you put yourself in, you will get it.",1
"Clear cut tests, makes lectures interesting, and is continously there to offer any extra help. ",1
He's horrible. Tough grader. Not clear. Not helpful. Don't take his class or you will fail.,0
He is one of the most enthusiastic and off the walls professors you'll ever meet. His grading is very fair. The exams aren't bad considering you can use a notes sheet. There's lots of Iclickers so you have to show up to class. There's no book used. Take this class its fun and interesting!,1
"Professor Baumgartner went above and beyond for all his students in Anatomy 101. Be ready to pay close attention to his lectures. If you plan on not going, plan on failing. He works with you and for you. He's also a great lab instructor. I just wish he would teach 102 and 201 :( ",1
Toughest grader I ever had at JMSB.,0
Blanton is super boring. He is a nice person but a horrible professor. He will try to make jokes; you will not laugh. Half the class is spent on him trying to figure out the computer. Not the worst class but you must be disciplined; it's easy to fall asleep.,0
"The issue with this man is that he lacks the ability to connect with students. During office hours, he is unwilling to help, directing students to MLC. During class he is literally talking to the whiteboard . His explanations may be be good at times but lost in his delivery. He is a nice person but teaching is not the right job for him.",0
He grades way to harshly for an intro class.,0
"Easy online class! 4 exams that are open for a week. The book and quizlet are very helpful for them. There are two simple assignments as well. Don't go through the trouble of taking this class in person if it's not your major, get it over with online. Recommend taking her!",1
she is very nice and doesnt mind helping you .the class was easy she really goes into detail about everything,1
This was by far one of the most difficult online class I have ever taken. Professor Knapp was very available and asked for me to reach out to him. But bottom line I take online classes because I don't have time for any extra meetings. I think the class would have been better had it been in person. I also don't think the book was helpful at all.,1
Worst professor I've ever had. Sits in front of the class and reads of a packet. Does not teach anything. Seton Hall is better of paying me to do a better job,0
Matt makes stats enjoyable for sure. He's a nice guy willing to help whenever you need it,1
Great Professor. truly cares about her students passing her class. She is helpful and really makes sure that her students are understanding her class. She is a loving professor and i hope i can have her for another sociology class.,1
"Professor Elliot is really great to have in class. She sets very clear expectations. If you do the work, it's likely that you'll do well.",1
Very very tough grader. Challenging and very interesting class but it is not worth destroying your gpa. CHOOSE ANOTHER PROFESSOR.,0
I hope that she teaches better in person than she does online. I have struggled through my entire semester with her online and I would not do it again.,0
She really likes class involvement but is extremely unwilling to work with you if you have something come up and can't make it to class. I had surgery over spring break and missed a few classes for appointments and she was very rude and unwilling to help me when I was asking to receive homework prior to classes so they weren't late.,0
"She's they type of professor that it'd be useless to argue with. It's her way, or no way. If you are writing about ANY of the films she shows you in class, SAY THAT YOU LIKE THEM. Arguing your point, no matter how valid you are, will result in a low grade.",0
"She isn't a tough grader but she's very politically correct. Often brings up discussions about race, discrimination, and the like which can sometimes make you uncomfortable. She's a decent professor overall.",0
"While Juliet may not be the best prof to grade your assignments, she is very caring and intelligent. Sometimes during the office hours, she can get carried away by off topics but you can always bring the conversation back to the focus by politely asking your question again. Be polite to her, because we dont have many lovely person like her.",1
loveddd her. shes so kind and her tests are fair. def take her. you will not regret it. ,1
DO NOT PLAGIARIZE. Careful how you reply to the discussions. I would not take any of his classes.,0
"Raquel is very personable. She gave my class 3 days to miss class, helped us with tests, and really gave us good advice on how to public speak. If you need to meet with her, she will make sure to do so. The class is very easy going and I personally loved going to her class. Her tests are based on notes taken and on videos watched in class.",1
"Ron is an outstanding professor, always willing to help out if you have any questions. Super funny, laid back, all around awesome. Best class ever!",1
Poor response to questions. Not very helpful and a very self taught class.,0
Mark is a great teacher always helpful and interesting; He supervise for 5 yearsd and He still cannot get rid of me. Don't bother with him if you are not willign to put the effort and run for your life if you just even think about plagarise a small section.,1
First off if you don't pass this class... you really didn't do anything. He's a good professor that makes it very clear on what he wants while not really asking for much. Do all the assignments and study for the test and your guaranteed a B minimum.,1
"She always has an excuse for why she couldn't return promised feedback and for why she is not prepared. She will give you a B or B+ on almost every project regardless of how well it is prepared and given. She'll also sometimes go on rants describing how ""Men do this..."" and how women are discriminated against.",0
"I had an A until the last two weeks of class. Only the auto-graded things were graded and given very little weight like 10%. The term paper wasn't graded before the final exam paper was due so you have no idea how she grades. The things she has to grade (essays, short answer) counted too much and weren't graded until too late to apply feedback! Ugh",0
"Professor AJ is an incredible teacher and her lectures are interesting and, she keeps you evolved . Her syllabus is easy to follow and she sometimes seemed to adjust her lectures to meet current events which allowed us to be able to discuss our opions in real time which I think is great. I would definitely recommend taking her class!!",1
I hated this class when I first started it. The class isnt structured and he's all over the place. I realized later that he really just wants us to become interested in the subject. He is very knowledgeable and I appreciated the class after it ended. I would take another class with him.,1
Very interested in correcting grammer and writing style and skills.Marks off for everything and she expects perfection even though she does not live up to her own standards.If you can take the class with another teacher I would do so.Good luck!,0
She was fine at first but she became very disorganized and had poor time management in the last two months of class. Most of the films we watched were not that interesting. If you miss more than 3 days your grade will be bumped down a letter grade (this didn't happen to me). There is extra credit but she will often tell you the day of.,0
"If you have notes, you will be fine. Practice exams are very close to real exams. I did not go to the class but still able to get a B.",1
Don't know where to begin. Lost all interest in foreign language after this course. Paola Conte has ruined it for me. Overall lack of organization of the class and lack of respect for the students. If I could give a zero rating...,0
Very interesting.  I am glad I signed up for her class.,1
She is not helpful at all. She is picky with who she helps. ,0
"I dont remember what section I took with her, but she knows her stuff she is awesome dont listen to these two bad comments she is awesome! You have to read you have to do the work otherwise she will call you out on it, but do the work ask questions in class and pay attention and its worth it i have learned so much in this class",1
"Dave is quite passionate about the topic of food science, he just isn't the most effective teacher. His lectures are very long and dry- I would have just learned from the slideshows myself, but there aren't makeups for the pop quizzes without pre-excused absences. The labs were easy and fine, and those instructors were more helpful.",0
"Goes off topic 90% of the time during the lecture. Super tough grader, always said we would do workshops in class to help people with what they were struggling with, but it never happened.",0
"First meeting she gave all the students attitude. Only did 1 review for the first exam and for the rest (including final) decided not to. We have to work around her schedule (she sleeps at 7 pm) and she lacks communication. If I didnt have any background knowledge of calc in high school, I wouldve failed this class. She doesnt teach at all",0
"A real nice guy. If you don't understand something, ask a question. He always answered mine nicely. He was also good at explaining things that were new to the class",1
"Sweetest thing. She is a tough grader, but she will let you rewrite things. we had 2 exams with a few papers. she wants you to ask questions and participate and loves those who do. i would recommend giving her drafts and still rewriting it. she gives you study guides for the exams which you have to know inside and out. go to her. sweetest thing!",1
"Easiest math professor I've ever had. He explains the material very thoroughly. The review is almost identical to the tests. The sample tests are take-home and in class for the real test, you're able to use your review and take home test. He always lets out early for night class and won't make you stick around, unless you need help. Very helpful.",1
"Don't take him for math! He's a computer teacher, not algebra, and he can't explain anything. Despite this he was very nice, made lots of beer jokes, and tried to help as much as possible. He was just not meant to teach math. Only take this if you need math courses beyond it or remember a LOT from high school algebra, otherwise take MATH127. l",0
He is a very nice professor and tries to be fair to everyone! He is one of the most responsible professors I've met and the topics we learn are fun!,1
"Okay, he's a great guy and hes funny, and hes a good prof. He gives you space to think for yourself and be creative with your own work. This is a pretty hard class though, and hes a relatively tough grader but its an interesting class. He uploads his slides but some slides are taken out, most likely to encourage people to attend class.",1
"This professor is unnecessarily critical. If you don't submit assignments exactly the way he tells you he will not give you a grade, even if you turn it in on time. On exam day my grandmother had her funeral and even after showing him proof of her obituary he wouldn't let me take the exam. This guy makes no exceptions. withdraw if life gets tough",0
"She only grades you on four tests, a case-study, and some lab work. She is an amazing person. She does so much and is a strong role model. Is it less than ideal? Yeah, but you get the grade you deserve. If you put the time in, you will learn more than you thought possible. She would do anything for her students, Its amazing how busy she must be ILC",1
I can't say enough about Prof. Martin. He was very patient with me and he challenged my long held beliefs without judgment. He had me write a reflective essay on a topic I had a hard time being open-minded about and he helped me with any questions I had along the way. I have never had a teacher help me so much. I'd 100% take his class again.,1
Worst prof ever- brought her toddler to class 3times including final exam! She expects to be accommodated but accommodates no student even if you have a learning disability. Boring classes- always starts talking about her own life for min. 1 hour every class. I tried complaining to the dept-  no reply! She should be fired. Waste of my money & time!,0
"I will never take a class by this professor again, nor anyone associated with him. He entered grades once two weeks in and hasn't since, you have to guess your current grade. If you're sick and in the hospital doesn't matter, you have to turn in his weekly essay (approx 5 pages minimum) does the absolute bare minimum, he shouldn't be a teacher.",0
"I thought Ms. Kelly was a great teacher judging from the reviews on here, and even from some earlier experiences with her. I am now writing this review to warn you all to be careful of her. She's a complete ghost after I've sent her a couple emails and even forwarded one for a follow up. Never heard back. I have now dropped her class.",0
"You would think in this day and age a professor would be able to use a computer, but apparently not. This teacher gives messy hand written notes. Gives notes strictly by talking which is hard to understand,talks fast, and just gives his view of the situation. His tests term part and essay part. Marks answers wrong even though they are right.",0
"When taking this class, you would have to be prepared to teach the material to yourself. He does not use any power points. You must read the textbook chapters, which are extremely long. His test are impossible to pass, even though they are multiple choice. Additionally, you have to read two long novels outside of class. If you don't, then you fail",0
"I HATE her with a passion. All year i submitted my assignments through copy and paste in the drop box online. One time she asked for attachment and out of force of habit i copied and pasted. She said that my work was not worth reading because I didnt ""follow directions."" Hours of work on that assignment and I have a fat ZERO to show for it",0
This class was useless. It was an absolute waste of time. It took time away from my family and now that I am student teaching many of the master teachers I have talked about this class to have found her assignments outdated and laughable. Best of luck on your 10 day science unit outline. You will never ever use that again.,0
Professor Smiley is by far one of the best English professor's that I've had. I'm usually not good in English as a subject but she made me a better writer when I do essays. I took her for English 101 and 102 and I pass the class with an A and B. She was very caring in her students and wants her students to understand the materials. She is awesome.,1
"Arevalo can sometimes come off badly to students that do not put forward the work in her class. She expects a fair amount but gives you plenty of time to work on projects. Her exams are mostly based on vocabulary, short answer, and reading the textbook. They are fair. Her lectures are sometimes rushed but she does genuinely care about students.",1
"Intelligent and cares about the subject matter, but dull and not very class-aware--doesn't give the students enough time to take notes on his slides. He also made a comment about Africa creating more waste than the USA because it's 'underdeveloped', a fact that is both false and ignorant.",0
"Terrible teacher. Gives no notes, no explanations, no anything. You can clearly tell that he hates to answer your questions. Just does examples on the board the whole entire class. Would not recommend this teacher to anybody that struggles with Math.",0
"Professor Nelson is very interesting and intelligent. However, his ECON 202 class was extremely difficult for me. His lectures are quite boring and the class is not mandatory, but HIGHLY recommended to go. If you are not a good test taker then I would NOT recommend his class for you. Your ONLY grade is exams!!! Overall, the WORST class I've taken.",0
"I picked her due to great reviews, BUT that may only be in class. DO NOT take her online! Had her for Summer 2. Only 4 assignments w/ a low grading scale (15,20,20,20)- No room for human error. Doesn't care to give a good feedback even when asked. Non-existent. Not her problem. I'd never take her again! I've had way better online class experience",0
Very clear course and professor. Highly recommended. ,1
"This was a terribly easy class. All of the exams were open book and really, that gave no incentive to actually learn any of the material. Ultimately, this class is what you make of it. If you really have the time to learn the material, go ahead! If you already have a heavy schedule, you can still very easily get an A with literally no effort.",1
Dr. Hazell was truly great! I wish that all of my professors were as inspiring as him. This was the first history class I actually enjoyed learning in. Would recommend taking his class x100,1
"Works with you on extra credit and unclear answers on quizzes. Will acquiesce if it's not a clear understanding of the material. Lots of powerpoint, youtube. Easily amused. Very understanding if you get behind. Gives extra points and free answers on exams. Often forgets where his classroom is , always answers emails.",1
She sometimes didn't respond to my emails and didn't give us enough information. Pushed the 3rd test and final so close together at the end of the semester. Spend most of your time trying to pass the frustrating mathxl questions,0
"She is such a terrible teacher. First test covered 12 chapters of material, class average in the 60's and she didn't curve. She doesn't really care if you're doing well or not. So lazy. Lab and HW bring up your grade if not no one would pass. Started to make lecture mandatory. Some test questions can be found verbatim from the online HW tho!!!!",0
"This course is definitely useful for someone who knows how to code. If you are not good at programming or you just know how to print out ""Hello world"" you should skip taking this course. But if you are a good programmer or java developer, fasten your seatbelt, you gonna have so much fun in the first part. The second part is paper discussion.",1
I would not recommend taking this class unless you are very interested in linguistics. There are no slides and lecture can be repetitive and dull. Attend class because your best bet is to repeat Sam verbatim on exams or you will probably be marked off.,0
Had her for microbiology. her tests can be very difficult if you dont read! she says skim through the text book for the rest that she doesnt get to go over in class but dont skim actually READ and you'll do well. very good lab teacher i aced the practical with an A,1
"Worst professor I have taken till date. Very boring lectures, feel like they never end. Very unfair grader. Please save yourself by taking another prof for 1700.",0
"Professor Hesford's class was by no means easy, but not a brain-buster either. She really cared about what she was teaching and strove to assist her students in any way possible. Great class!",1
"First art class taken at Oneonta and she was great. Open to all ideas, I've never heard her tell anyone their ideas/projects were bad. Even if you're not good at art she helps improve your basic skills. Class focused a lot on compositions and basic art elements. Some work outside of class if you didn't finish a project but no real hw.",1
"LOVE this teacher. Hard because there is a lot of info and not many assignments to get points on, so take your time with them. Lectures are interesting and funny. Class goes quick. Learned a lot and would recommend to others. ",1
"She is the best professor EMU has. You need to go to class and pay attention and you will do well, she is excellent at explaining the material and will do anything to help her students. This is not an easy class by any means but if you listen to her and prepare for exams you can most definitely get an A. Her exams are extremely fair.",1
"Scanlon is a very funny, but sarcastic person. He might come off as stand-offish sometimes, but he is a very good professor. It just depends on your sense of humor. Overall he is very good at explaining things, but you are required to put forth a lot of effort too if you want to pass this class.",1
"She is a kind woman, but not a good professor. She would often go way off topic and we would hardly cover any material in the little time we had. I basically felt as though I had to teach myself accounting. When students would ask questions I felt as though she wasn't understanding what they were asking and she would clearly give wrong answers.",0
"Teaches you to think, at least tries. Dr. Chen treats students as adults, so some independent work is expected. Read the textbook before class and make your own notes from it. His class notes are not very organized, more like a review. Dr. Chen does not usually assign practice from the textbook, but it'll help if you do some for every chapter.",1
He is one of my favorite psych professors! He is absolutely hilarious. I am taking his forensic Psych class during the pandemic period and he still always makes the class fun and interesting. He is a delight and an awesome professor to work with. He is very upfront. Cant fail! Unless of course you don't participate and do his easy 10 question quiz.,1
"Seems like a nice guy, but that means little when 90% (his #, not mine) of students fail his classes. He moves quickly, and you take TONS of notes. By the time you finish writing something, he already moved on. I know everyone makes mistakes when doing math, but we have to correct him 8 or 10 times a day. He uses ambiguous wording on tests, too.",0
"Professor Bowles knew what he was talking about and accepted any and all questions with great answers in class.  However, sometimes he went too fast in class and he did not post any of his examples online that he did in class in case you missed.  Overall he was average and I would probably take his class again.",1
"He was a decent teacher, but I wouldn't take him again. He's very liberal and pushes his views on students a little more than he should.",0
Matt Anderson is one of the few professors that actually cares about his students as people.,1
"Zank is extremely intelligent, funny, and kind. I did learn a lot from his class and think he is a wonderful professor. Only thing is he a little disorganized, though that got fixed towards the end. If you're interested in the Bible and can work through a little disorganization, take this  class. Not a lot of homework but very great readings.",1
Absolutely terrible at explaining things and talks too low to be heard unless you're in the front row. Lectures are very rambly. Didn't seem very confident about anything he was teaching. Would not take again.,0
"Professor LeFlouria is absolutely amazing and she really knows her stuff. Pay attention in her class, listen to her lectures and even participate in the class and you will do well.  Anyone that fails her class is simply by their own doing.  She even gives extra credit that is worth percentage points. Best teacher at FAU hands down!",1
"I learned a lot and worked hard, but my grade did not reflect my efforts. The highest grade on assignments/exams is usually a B. Average grade is barely passing. You will learn a lot in her class, but at the cost of your GPA; no matter how hard you work.",0
"He speaks very softly, sometimes, you can hear nothing, but it doesn't matter, nothing interesting. Questions for the quizzes he gives only from the textbook. Don't be late, if you miss his quizzes you are in trouble. If you came to him to his office hour he will be surprised and will not talk to you. He is most awful professor from my experience.",0
"best teacher ever. she goes out of her way to help students. not only with the work for her class, but also with personal issues or whatever a students needs. shes gives helpful advice and can even help u get free money for textbooks. :-) she is the person you want to know if u ever find yourself in a difficult situation.",1
"Habitually unprepared, with rambling, unfocused, mind-numbing lectures that made it virtually impossible to pay attention in class. He was so behind schedule (due to slow pace and lack of preparation) that we ended up skipping over multiple key subjects. Avoid if at all possible.",0
"Jay is one of the best professors at Bentley. He knows so much about audit, and is truly dedicated to educating people on the subject. There would be no reason to take anyone else for audit. So passionate, very entertaining, and gives so many opportunities for extra credit. Great teacher, highly recommended, and you will learn a lot.",1
"She had an attitude when students asked  questions and criticized them for not knowing the answers.  I emailed her for help and she refused! When I went to class she was rude again, but got quiet when she realized I was prepared. I've heard similar experiences from other students. Luckily I only had her for lab and passed the course overall.",0
"Great teacher. You want to pass? Need to study. Tries her best to help you with all she can. She is flexible. She does not want you to fail. You will learn in this class as well, not an easy class but not a super hard one either.",1
"Sometimes it is hard to understand his Texas accent but he means well. He was late to our classes sometimes but wasn't strict with us about things like that, so he's fair. The class was pretty easy overall. Brown used the previous prof's syllabus, so no surprises. Not a great teacher compared to the others here but he's new and still learning.",0
"I wouldn't recommend her online EDU104 class to anyone. She doesn't respond to emails  in a timely manner, and when she replies it sounds like she thinks you're stupid. It also seems like she thinks this class is the only class you're taking and you have no other responsibilities. ",0
"slow and boring. reads directly from slides. concepts are reeeaaally easy its like learning about enzymes in high school again, but makes you memorize a large list of drugs and all their specific receptors in the body. tells you what kind of questions we'll see on exam but it doesn't matter if you don't have that list memorized.",0
Loved having this class! Professor Dunham was awesome! He made everything in class easy to understand and I learned so much! He also made the class super fun! Would 100% recommend him!,1
"super irresponsible, not good ppl to communicate",0
"I wouldn't recommend taking his class during the summer. Really fast paced. Tests were every week. Note cards allowed. However, no extra credit and no lowest test grade drop. Clear grading criteria and does get back to you as soon as he can. Tests are worth 70% of your grade.",0
"If you have no background in  stats, absolutely avoid this class. He honestly reads directly off the powerpoint, (which he didn't even make), and he is no help if you ask any questions. It always seems like he just wants to get out of the class as quickly as possible. He is the worst professor I could ever imagine having in college.",0
"He Grades hard, Boring class",0
"Like other negative reviews, he does give pop quizzes and is a bit rude, however Lab class is Lab and his lecture doesn't really matter as you need to memorize the lab lists and models for the exams. Hes pretty much there for any extra info you need but 99% of Lab is just memorizing the lists and models",0
"The class was mainly lecture and discussion based. very little assignments given in class. All exams were papers that were about 1-2 pages. For final, there was only a project which you need to present in class. He very critical with grading his paper. He is a good professor and passionate about what he teaches. The textbook is needed!",1
"THIS PROFESSOR IS HORRIBLE. She grades horribly and failed me on a paper because I chose a prompt that other students chose. She teaches the exact same things over and over but will count you off on papers and discussions if you bring them up in your own work. I do not recommend her at all. Yes, she's sweet, but she's a horrible professor.",0
This the absolute worst professor anyone can have he belittles your opinion and he's always talking about thing that are not related to the work itself.  He is always bringing in his political views constantly. He never explains his papers thoroughly and gives no helpful information. Talks a lot of irrelevant things rather than teach!!!,0
"Although i can't stand to listen to him s-l-o-w-l-y p-r-o-n-o-u-n-c-e e-v-e-r-y w-o-r-d, he is very nice, and practically throws the marks at you.  A little dedication is all you need to get an A (Practically no chemistry knowledge required!).",0
I took him years ago at San Jacinto. I had been out of school for a long time and was never strong in math. He makes you think! You have to get past the block in your head!,1
Final required you to attend class as questions came from lectures. ,1
save your gpa and don't take her class. trust me,0
"She expected you to know everything, but taught you nothing. Lovely lady, but terrible professor. Avoid her at all costs unless you want your GPA to drop!",0
"Dr. Wood is an amazing professor. She is very knowledgable and is willing to help anybody that is willing to help themselves. She is also somebody that you can talk to about personal issues. Her classes are weighted very test heavy, 70% to 75%. However, if you pay attention and put in the time and effort an A in the class is definitely achievable.",1
"He focuses on the text book for everything. Doesn't like to be wrong, he's always right because ""he's a professional"". I thought I was doing great and expected a b+ ended up with a C!!!!! he sure is a tough grader. Expects for you to be working on his class all the time.",0
"Garbage! Should be thrown out of teaching entirely. No piazza, no slides, nothing but his snide, long-winded lectures and demeaning jokes about any student that asks a question. I'm disgusted that I had to pay to take this guys class. He thinks he's god gift to man, constantly preening himself, but he never actually provides any value to my degree",0
"Would definitely not recommend her to anyone. She gives out a lot of assignments, papers every week, takes weeks to grade them, its November and none of my papers have been graded from the first month of school yet. She goes off-topic a lot, never responds to email, would never take this class again.",0
"Schaumann is one of the best professors I have come across, he is clear, helpful, and very knowledgeable. He uses a lot of real world experience in his teaching which makes the class much more fulfilling! Do not be intimidated by him! This class is worth it.",1
"She only had about 10 homework assignments and 3 exams. I barely studied (I took hard calculus before this class) or came to the zoom class and I even missed an exam and still got a B. Her accent was hard to understand at times though, and she wasn't the most engaging. Easy A, but I'd rather have a more passionate teacher.",1
"She is a very nice lady, always in a good mood and knows every students name, but she makes the material but more complicated than it needs to be. Be prepared for lots of online homework and quizzes in drill almost every week. Attendance is mandatory or you cannot do well.",1
"I have not taken a math class since my junior year of high school so I was very nervous about taking this class. She made it SO MUCH EASIER. She wants people to come to her office hours, she tells the whole class that you can just sit there and do homework. SHE WANTS TO HELP YOU. If you raise your hand for a question she will stop and help!",1
"Literally lectures off-topic the entire course. Always mentions ""if it were up to me the corporate tax would be 0%, that way all the people sitting on their couch, drawing checks, would have some jobs"", and always says something about robots taking over at least once each class. I would recommend finding a diff prof",0
"First part of class is lecture for 30 min, then speakers are brought in on the topic, then watch a video. All topics that are relevant and fun to learn about. Have to go to class because a TA takes attendance. All tests are online and Knox is funny and keeps the class very interesting. Really enjoyed this class",1
"Insulting the legends, and making fun of them. Wow. What a teacher.",0
"I like Psychology a lot, but it seems like we missed multiple points of the class. Since it was online, all her homework were nice and easy. Exams were tough, the application of it makes more harder. She's very caring and sweet, definitely would like you to pass her course. Self-study and takes a lot of time for her to respond. Overall, she's great",1
"He is a very nice person, but too jumbled/distracted in lectures to stay focused easily. As long as you do the hw, and STUDY it for quizzes/tests (they are both solely BASED OFF THE HW, don't study your lecture notes like I did and completely fail a quiz). Take him if you can, others are worse. You'll pass with him. Remember, 77 is easier than 76.",1
Easily the worst professor I ever had in college. She is insanely strict and expects you to never make mistakes. Like EVER. There were many nights where I would just start crying because one little thing was inaccurate on my work and she would give the entire assignment an 'F' and be horribly rude about it. She does not communicate well at all.,0
"Seriously one of the best professors I had throughout my years here. He is busy with work outside of school, but will ALWAYS make time for his students. I was able to discuss with him literally anything that I had concerns about related to the coursework or questions in the psychology realm like grad school. Helped me out so much!",1
"DO NOT TAKE THIS TEACHER. HE IS THE WORST. HE IS RACES, UNLESS U ARABIC (AL QUAIDA) AND YOU WILL GET AN A. DO YOURSELF AND THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE A FAVOR AND STAY AWAY FROM HIM. IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SUFFER TAKE HIM, HE WILL LET U WORK HARD AND YOUR LIFE WILL BE MISRABEL.",0
A hard class.,1
Be prepared to teach yourself after about the first 30% of the semester. Youtube videos are the only way I made it through this class. Labs take 10-15 hours for a 1 credit class. Rafla is quite disorganized and often makes many mistakes during lecture. Going to class and doing homework is not enough to do well. Exams are very difficult.,0
Is a decent lecturer but falls short. She is often forgetful of meetings with students and student's names. She is a very tough grader without providing specific or helpful feedback. Often gives group marks which are not a proper reflection of individual students. Allows personal affairs to interfere with projects (trouble in family? bad mark).,0
"He was tough for me as I did a lot of self teaching. I would take him again only because I know how he works now. 8 Chapter quizzes and 3 exams are the only grades in the book so that makes it tough. Be ready to spend all of your time on MyMathLab - that part was hell, but he relieved us towards the end. Mainly all online",1
Really a horrible teacher had to drop math 112 from winter term. This class she doesn't know the material at all and student ask her if she supposed to follow the math formula in the text book and then she get mad and yells as the student. Really a rude instructor and bad at teacher math course. Please avoid taking this instructor for math.,0
Professor Mahallati's INTL 5530 graduate international law course requires a lot of reading. Her use of the socratic method challenged me to research topics more closely and prepare for class. Her questions were insightful and pushed me to higher levels. Course requires a lot of analytical thinking.,1
"Very easy to follow and makes a difficult subject more comparmentalized. two small papers and two huge tests, take lots of studying  but it is doable",1
"I have taken Dr. Larson for 3 other classes(all online) . the work that she gives  is with a fair amount of time to  completed and submitted each week. it opens on Monday at 1 am and closes Sunday nights at 11:59pm.   I would recommend taking  her, if you do all the work, you will get an  A or A -. The book is essential since its an online class. ",1
"Chris's class is pretty laid back. The grading revolves around four easy essays, a research paper, and a written midtermfinal. He gives little lectures on writing and other random things and is a rather easy grader on most of the stuff. The textbook is just used to read the short stories in class nearly every day. It's overall relaxed and easy.",1
"She has been changing assignments dates and adding assignments. She will say things like ""I don't want to overwhelm you..."" then proceeds to go overboard with what it due. She is incredibly rude and if you don't do it her way then it's not any other way. She also asks students to share private health information for a grade, which is terrible.",0
"Miracle is the worst professor I have ever had. I can't believe he is still even allowed to teach at a major university like the U. Honestly I took AP Calc AB and he made me MORE confused on material I already knew. Easy material, though. Tests are straightforward and easy as expected. You learn EVERYTHING in discussion, so go to those.",0
"I used to love physics, but Slamet made me hate it. Her exams were very difficult, and even if you thought you did well on them, she marks off points on the stupidest things. Avoid if possible.",0
"She was ok. I felt that her direction was not very clear in the grading and course work. She did more english than history for the most part. I felt she got thrown into this class because they needed a professor. We watched a lot of fictional movies of World War 1, though nice , completely irrelevant.",0
"GET HER. seriously. She always changes deadlines if we have problems, she is suuuper nice and she teaches so well. Do the HW, do the quiz, do the review and i don't know how you can not end up with an A. I'm Balls at math and i got an A+. Maybe go to office hours for the Quiz, the last ones are tricky. follow he class notes and do NOT read the book",1
"laid back cancelled class when he felt like it, just like not showing up, or being an hour late, raised all our grades on a curve, i lucked out and got a B. he was very very relaxed. No homework ever, used text book once entire semester.",0
very strong accent. very hard to understand.  I didn't learn anything in this class.  He teaches stuff that should be common sense to most people.  If you know  how to use a computer this class should be easy for you.  He gives out multiple choice tests which arent too bad.  pretty boring lectures.   Veryyy easy to pass class just do all the work!,0
Marek would be easier to comprehend if he stopped taking English lessons from E.T.,0
"This Professor is straight to the point, with what she expects from the students, out of the class. Whatever work that you do, is the grade that you earn. She is preparing us for the real world, and all of the challenges that come with it. Thank you! I will definitely considering taking another class with you, in the future.",1
not helpful. lets computer teach you. never sure when stuff due because you expected extended deadlines but then find out one person got and you didn't. I'm lost and taking different teacher next term.,0
Terribly boring and monotone.  Wasted 1.5 lectures due to technical difficulties even though we had the notes and held us responsible for the material.  Exam questions are very detailed and difficult and some on material not covered in the course.,1
"Mr. Holt is a very knowledgeable instructor. He definitely know his stuff and will help you if you ask for it. However, his lectures are virtually useless. He is easily distracted by questions and goes off on long tangents. It's really hard not to like the guy as a person, but i would avoid him as an instructor. READ THE TEXT.",0
"This woman SUCKS!!! All she does is talk about her kids and let other illegitimate classmates distract her from the course. I got an easy A in this class from doing my homework and showing up to class. Eventhough attendence is not required, it is very helpful when she stays on track. She has 4 kids and constantly talks about them...annoying.",1
Professor Bonner is a great teacher who guides students to understand all of the material. He would not leave anyone behind and would answer any questions people had. He is easily the best teacher i have had. I highly recommend you take him if you get a chance!,1
"Went off on tangents a LOT. Too much for my ADHD brain to really handle, but worksheets are provided for each unit and all the answers are on Quizlet, so I still did fine. Extra credit was on his dad's military history (also on Quizlet, lol), which seems bonkers. Never opened the book, not needed to do well.",0
His assignments & lectures (monologues) provided little groundwork for success in the class & his teaching (telling) was far from thorough. Pretty much nobody had a clear idea of what aspects of his teaching to digest & remained hopeful that a miracle would occur on an exam. It was hard to prepare for class/exams... I would consider other options.,0
"Owen is as zany as they come.  You're basically learning chemistry from Jim Carrey.  He inundates you with content and requires total comprehension.  50% of all test questions are trick questions in an already difficult subject.  He is not very approachable in office hours.  If you can't pay attention for the entire lecture, you will not do well.",0
"MUST read textbook, assigns 1-4 readings before each class on top of it, various lengths. Super into presentations. Blue book exams. This class was harder than my 600 level class for my major, he throws a lot of information at you, most of which will go over your head if you skip a reading. Be prepared to participate, if you don't you won't pass.",0
"I didn't dislike her, but thought she was overrated. Random acts of sass got old really quickly.",0
"The workload felt like a six credit course and I was not prepared for all the reading. You have to read the very difficult textbook to do the weekly quizzes but don't need it for the final, which is annoying. Studied an hour every day for the whole summer while working full-time and got an A so it's not impossible, it just won't be easy.",0
"100% the best professor I've had at UK so far, he's very passionate and knowledgeable about what he's teaching. There's just a few quizzes, a project, and a few participation points. He's always approachable and willing to help with anything. I wasn't even interested in the subject but he made me love this class. Highly suggest any class with him!",1
This professor is the most awful professor in this college. I totally don't understand why this college doesn't fire him. He frequently is too late to come to class and absent all the sudden. He is terrible as a professor and a business person. I am regretting to take his class. He can't care about students.,0
"If you are confident in your writing capability, Paul is a great teacher to have. For those that are still learning English or have had difficulty with writing in the past, this class will be difficult.He is very patient with stupid questions and helps everyone understand assignments. A lot of busy work, but helps cushion grade.",1
goat,1
"This guy made the class interesting.  He's the best teacher I've had, but then looking at the ratings of my profs it really seems I've had bad luck with teachers.",1
"Prof. Hinshaw is by far the best prof, I have ever had: he is interesting, smart, REALLY involved and interested in the material himself, he is funny, and seems like a genuine and caring person (just as a side note). If you have to chose one professor to not to miss during your time at CAL, Hinshaw is definitely the one!",1
"His lectures are straight forward, have good structure, and are easy to understand. He gives good examples and uses online resources a lot. His study guides are practically the exams - so if you are doing bad, you just didn't study. Don't need the book. Also, he is tall and hot. But he's REALLY flirty with attractive females... a little bit creepy!",1
HE IS SUPER!!!!!!,1
"Ridiculously hard for online classes. Be prepared to either know math beforehand, know someone who can tutor you intensely or teach yourself. I'm an A student and worked my rear off to barely get an A. I can't even say I learned a much so it wasn't helpful for future use... Would not recommend.",0
"really nice guy and open to trying to clarify any confusion on topics during his lectures which I found out not all profs are willing to do (would rather you ask in office hours or after their lecture). tests are pretty easy as well for the most part, and tests mostly on concepts rather than math and equation heavy questions (only a few per test)",1
"I took Stats after being out of school for 10 years almost. Mr. huff does an amazing job of explaining the material and spending the time needed to see others succeed. Study is necessary, but he gives you all the tools you need! Great professor! Highly recommend.",1
Questions on exams and hoemwork seemed to be worded to confuse you or required that you had prior knowledge of an unrelated subject. Gives few if any example problems. Most people did poorly on the exams yet he did not take responsibility for it. ,0
"This class is the worse I have taken during my time at this college. He will grade based on opinion, if he doesnt agree with your opinion on discussions he will fail you. I have straight As on the rest of my courses but this class I have an F and I have spent sleepless nights writing the essays for him to say he doesnt like my opinion on subject",0
"her organizational skills are terrible. She is quick to change the schedule whenever it suits her, without warning the class. The teacher even goes over lessons in class, which have nothing to do with the chapter we have read. She never responds to emails, and is quick to deduct points based off grammar. She's also Always late when grading homeowr.",0
No email response ever. Terrible feedback. Terrible grading. Quiz questions make no sense and neither do the writing assignments. Very poor communication.,0
Take her!!! She is amazing! I am so glad I took her for Sociology! Would take her again! She has discussion and quiz every week. She grades them soon after you complete and she is not a hard grader at all as long as you complete correctly. You get three attempts on the quiz for best grade. It just generates different questions each time.,1
Wasn't the most helpful or friendliest counselor. Made me feel like I was doing everything wrong and just didn't seem to want to help.,0
"He is a very good professor with efficient teaching methods. if you want to get a good grade, just understand the material he gives to you.",1
"One of the best teachers for Stats. Much more into the context of the problems, than the formulas themselves. Easy going and attendance is only essential because its math and can get confusing if you don't stay up to date. I would take her for any math class. Lots of homework( statlab), but that is good when the exams roll around.",1
"I took a course from her online in Fall 2020 and it wasn't too bad. There was hardly any interaction with the teacher and she seemed to have technical difficulties a lot. The course was the average amount of work, but with no lecture. Book was free!",1
makes you speak in front of the class a lot. tough and expects you to learn spanish almost immediately,0
I emailed him and asked him multiple times to meet with me throughout the semester - got very few responses the entire time. AKA hard to get ahold of. If we were in class it would probably be much better. Fill out the study guides as much as possible and you will pass.,1
One of the best foreign language teachers I've ever had. Makes everything really clear and doesn't make you feel pressured to know everything right away. Learned so much in her class.,1
"More than half of the class dropped her class and out of 12 of us that were left, about 4 of us had to email the dean about her behavior. On the final she said we have to show work even on multiple choice question b/c if we dont we wont receive credit. Takes points off labs for things such as commas and dots. Also has an envy towards girls",0
Dr. Kim is very particular but if you do the work she will help you pass with a good grade in her class. She holds her students to a higher standard which is to be expected in grad school. Class time goes the whole time & she does not cancel. You must always make a comment in each class to be considered there & to get the participation points.,1
"Not concise- takes several different tries to get one thought across. Talks way too much. Be afraid getting caught in a conversation, it'll go on for way too long. Cares a lot but not a good teacher.",0
DeMello is a great teacher. I was worried as he is from India but his accent is not distracting at all. Weekly assignments and only 3 tests the whole semester. He assigns homework for extra credit on the tests and gives a curve as well. Overall I would take a course with him again. ,1
He does everything using activities rather than lectures.   I thought that was helpful in demonstrating the concepts in ways that I could see.  It also helped with practice with calculations so by the time the exams came I had done the calculations plenty of times.,1
"Professor Kubota has a great sense of humor and is always great fun in the classroom. However, she does get right to work and makes sure that the class learns what they need to during the lesson. Towards the end of this course it does get really fast-paced and difficult. But that has more to do with the material not really professor Kubota's fault.",1
Grades are due in 5 days... she hasn't graded anything in over 3 months. You'll be expected to write huge summaries on topics that are barely a paragraph long (usually 3 huge summaries per chapter). She doesn't answer her emails either. She allows rewrites if you want a better grade... too bad she hasn't graded the original paper yet. 4/10,0
What an amazing professor. Funny. Helpful. A GREAT teacher. I learned a ton and had a blast while doing it!,1
"I'm surprised at all of the negative ratings, I thought he was an excellent professor. Very responsive and intelligent, I enjoyed his class very much.",1
"Even if you do the weekly 3x D2L postings, they have to be perfect or you won't get the mark. Group project is actually worse than you could imagine with no support from the prof. Impossible grader - midterm was a disaster. He's a good person, very nice, but it's almost like he wants people to regret taking an online course.",0
"Dr. Hill does a fantastic job presenting material. If you dont understand, you can reach out to her and she will go above and beyond for you. She is eager to help you learn and truly enjoys teaching. She makes psychology fun. Youd be interested in a career in Psychology after taking her class if you werent already. She wants you to succeed!",1
"Prof. Gier is definitely caring and a great professor! His lectures were on point, he goes through everything you need for the test. He also shows interesting videos and gives real life examples of the theory you learn, which really helps. As long as you read and do your work, his class is an easy A and you'll learn a lot!",1
"She was incredibly disorganized and confusing. I understand her being stressed with COVID and the transition to remote classes, but this was a college class we paid for. One good thing about her, was that she gave us a large amount of time to complete assignments... but did not grade them in a timely manor so we did not know what our grades were.",0
"The final exam is based off the reading of one of his textbooks that I didn't buy, and I nearly failed it. Make sure to buy and read the textbooks. However, everything else in the class was relatively easy and fun. We watched a Netflix series which was awesome, and the other assignments required minimal work except for the research paper.",1
"Professor Chidinma Udezeh taught my Special Topics in international Businesss class (IBUS 1391). I made a B in this class. She is in the habit of saying ' im here to help you succeed', which i believe completely, but i doubt that she will be willing to help you succeed if you are not willing to help yourself :). Yep, i know folks who failed too.",1
 Gave us the opportunity to focus on experiential learning not testing. Our class ended up with two entries accepted to Greenlight Michigan contest at MSU with one winning $5K.  Barcley (goes by first name in class) is not conventional and seems more focused on the high energy start-ups in San Fran and the Valley than the uptight mid-west.,1
HORRIBLE; honestly talked more about her life and family tahn math. If you asked for help; you would not recieve any from her. I have never done bad in any class until she became one of my teachers.,0
"Paul Mueller is an excellent guidance counselor. He simply puts students into groups to complete a workbook, sits back and refuses to answer questions. Tests are a serious struggle, due to the lack of preparation in class along with the grading period wich seems to be a semester-long process.",0
Worst professor for this class. Love the class material but she assigned way too much work for a gen ed class. Not to mention she basically completely ignored her students when classes became online.,0
"Apparently his traditional classes are totally different. But I took his online course, and it is the most unorganized online course I ever took. Assignments and announcements from past semesters all over the place. I do not have enough characters to fully explain how horrible this online course truly is. Stick to seated courses with this guy.",0
"Mark was a great professor. At first I didn't think the class would work well considering he's pretty young, however it was quite the opposite. He more than well knows what he's doing and everything you do in that class is designed to make you a better writer. He gives great feedback on essays and explains things really well. ",1
"I recommend this professor for prep math, intro 1 , intro 2 and intermdiate algebra she has a relaxed teaching style and gives 5% extra credit for going to math lab.She gives you every opportunity not to fail.",1
"Amazing professor. Everyday she brought food for the class. But besides this, she took the time to read my essay and fix them. She offered to come to school on a non class day just to sit with anyone who wanted help with their final essays. This is a professor that will help you succeed if you want to succeed.",1
"BY FAR ONE OF THE BEST, REALLY CARES, FAIR, ABOVE BOARD WITH ALL HE DOES, ONLINE CLASS AND WAS GREAT,,,, GROUP PROJECT IS GREAT BUT LAZY STUDENTS DO NOT HELP BUT ARE DEALT WITH,,,,,TEST HARD BUT ARE DOABLE.....A MUST TAKE CLASS OR CLASSES WIHT PROF. CARR",1
"Good teacher overall. as with any online, alot of writing. She is rather tough on grading. Not always clear until after poor grade was received, what she wanted.",1
"She talks to Fast!!! , Its a 50 minute class, The first exam she expected it done quickly, and was repeating, ""I don't think I'll be getting a lecture in,  with the quiz taking the class so long."" Needless to say , we did the rest of the quizzes online.  She repeated several times thru out the course she didn't know how to do formulas.  PPT were :(",0
"He is very tough, and a strict grader. He is not welcoming to the students at all. Get ready to take notes and not understand what he is talking about at all. Just study from the study guide and mark down notes that he mentioned to be on the exam and memorize how he did it.",0
the absolute worst professor i have ever had. DO NOT take this class if you aren't already good at economics because she is not going to teach you AT ALL. good luck if you're stuck with her.,0
"Okay listen Hellquist is a really great guy and I think under different circumstances this class would have been so much better. Moving online did not do well for him and he ended up overloading us with too much work. Also, the tests are IMPOSSIBLE and way too long. This class is so hard online and it made me stressed out the entire semester. AVOID",1
"I just taken her class 102 in this fall term. But I didn't catch her voice when she read the book. She just said to us that you don't need to use textbook. Damn! If you are study as international student, don't choose her class. It must be difficult for you.",0
"Very confusing professor. I have extensive musical experience and even I get confused. Does not teach how to read music, although it is not a prerequisite for the class but is necessary for success. I do not reccommend taking her.",0
"I want to be fair as much as I can, but she's a real tough grader she deducts a lot of marks for very simple mistakes, marks were flying out just like money on a shopping spree and she won't help you with any extra credit either. So, don't let your GPA suffer. She is a good teacher though but still Gen chem I doesn't have to be that hard.",0
"Marc is a very nice guy don't get me wrong, but I took him for geography and physical science. The test are mad hard and the study guides do not help. Half of the stuff on the test aren't even on the study guide.",0
"Grosholz is a terrible teacher.  The subject material wasn't particularly interesting, for me, but she presented it in a totally incomprehensible and random.  She's brilliant but a useless teacher.  Drop this class if you're taking it.",0
"Very sweet and caring professor! My first semester of college and she gave me a great learning experience/atmosphere!I recommend her to everyone, pretty simple grading scale. You go mrs. p!",1
Concepts discussed in class are definitely easier to understand if you have some real work experience which you can relate them to. Professor has great powerpoints for each class that you can follow and never need to open the textbook. There is a group project which is a major portion of your grade but she is flexible with deadlines.,1
The class is hard!!!! if you want to get a good grade your are going to have to study a lot read all your notes that you take in class... if you want an easy class this is not the right one ... if you want to learn and do homework and study a lot this is the right class for you!,0
"There is a lot of reading in this class that is very, very dense so do not take during a heavy semester because you will spend a lot of time reading. Lecture and section are mandatory. Professor Roberts does not give a very organized lecture, but the material is really interesting. I am still confused about what they wanted for the papers...",0
"I'm taking her class and I really enjoy it! She's super understanding of personal issues and is really willing to work with you if you talk with her. She gives great comments on your work which are very helpful. Not the best class, but she's a great teacher.",1
"By far one of the worst and rudest profs that I have ever taken. Does not keep office hours appointments and is very condescending to anyone who isn't a scholar in calculus. Lots of homework and grading on ""major"" and ""minor"" exams is beyond confusing. Does belittle students during class if you ask a question.",0
"Bad online course.  I've taken several at RCCC, and this was by far the most unorganized - poor page layout and LOTS of broken links.  Doesn't participate on the discussion forum.  Lecture ""notes"" and powerpoints are useless.  Tests are simply fact-finding missions out of the book - but not always from the chapter your studying.  Poor online course",0
"I had him for a visual concepts course and I swear that was a trial. He was so particular when grading but explained nothing when giving the assignment. It was so annoying. I almost wanted to quit the art program. I mean, I got a B. But no matter how much I pestered him I could never get a clear answer on how to get an A.",0
Shamane is an absolutely worthless professor.  Its interesting how an extremely picky writing teacher who is a lawyer still uses the word ain't.  And she calls us unprofessional.  What a joke.  Shamane is full of herself and not too much knowledge of how to teach or anything else good for that matter.,0
"The best part of this class is when it's over. This class is almost too fun. He uses puppets, imaginary competitive juggling, log throwing, and mustache growing to show how invisible neutrinos are the real cause of his headaches. He also once arm wrestled a bear to raise funds for cancer. He is truly too good to be a chem 101 teacher.",0
Many guest lecturers from MAE department.  Kept things interesting.,1
"Worst class I have ever taken. I wrote a paper that followed ALL the guidelines, but it was failed because my ""views"" were different than what he wanted. Also, the final is four exam essays, 350 words each and 2 hours to do all of it. Mess up? Automatic 0%. Never take this class. Worst teacher I have ever worked with. Save yourself the time.",0
"Would very highly recommend. If you have the chance, TAKE HER! Her lectures/class are very structured and gives end of chapter problems that give you a huge hint on what to expect for exams. Exams are super straightforward.",1
"Liz was by far the worst professor I've had. She was such a difficult grader, and her comments on papers and quizzes was condescending and rude. She was not helpful at all, and didn't seem like she had student's best interests at heart. Her lectures were so boring, she talked very quietly and most of her lectures were just plot summary anyways.",0
"He's a laid back professor. Especially with attendance. If you read the book, you don't have to show up to all of the classes. Some call him a hard grader, but he actually has his own grading scale that makes his tests easier to pass. Good with getting grades up quick. Occasionally his tests are hard. Don't expect his lectures to be interesting.",0
"Funny teacher, always willing to help, explains concepts well, work load is average. Really worth taking his class.",1
"He is a man of utmost character, full of positive energy, British sarcastic wit, and near infinite caring. As much effort as you give you will get back; pay attention to his lectures and do the straightforward online homework and you're guaranteed to pass. The beginning, the end, the one who is many; prepare yourself for the Monahan experience.. :)",1
"Don't take her. Anatomy is a hard class already. You don't need to be burdened by a teacher who doesn't know anything about what she is teaching. If you ask her questions about the material, she will tell you to ""Google it"" (Even if it is on material she just went over). Also watch your grades as she won't give you all of yours.",0
Worst professor I have ever had! Assignments were unclear and very difficult. Would not recommend!,0
"Don't recommend taking her. Reads straight off the power point, doesn't give out study guides, isn't helpful. Your grade is pretty much based off your test grades, if you can pass the tests you won't pass at all.",0
He is humorous. He makes you feel comfortable in class and lab also. But he does care what you have done in lab. He is helpful and highly appreciates your efforts. Good teacher,1
He was an awesome teacher. He gives you the exam questions beforehand and if you read the material he puts on BB and go to class you should be able to get As or Bs on the exams. If you miss any class though he deducts points but gives you extra credit opportunities. Definitely one of the best classes I've taken!,1
"Dr. Fazelpour is an amazing professor. Spends extra time with students after class to ensure they understand. spend in total writing 80+ program but most are just copying code with some homework; working in pair. Test cover question from the book, a lot the question are the same as the given study guide.",1
She really shouldn't try to make friends with the students. Its unprofessional,0
"Don't even get me started on this dude. Went into the class with 6 years of studying French and after it, I dropped my french minor. Took him on Tues, and Thurs and don't expect anything less then 2-3 hours of homework per class period. Tests are ea breeze but good luck getting ANYTHING above a B on each homework. don't take. Seriously...",0
"He is somewhat passionate about A&P, but lacks the microbio/biochem knowledge to teach at an upper level. Many of his quizzes aren't based upon what you know, but how well you memorized his convoluted diagrams. His lecture heavy class shows a general disregard for depth. Labs are rudimentary.",0
"I took the online psych1 class. Bernadette is one of the kindest teachers i've ever had. Her feedback is great and she even adds "":-)"" to emails which I thought was cute. That being said you will do A LOT of group work in this class. You are basically at the mercy of your group members. Her exams are also really tough too. Expect to feel anxious.",1
"Ive taken a few of her classes, if you do the work you pass but she is a very frustrating professor. Since she is an abstract artist, she wants every piece to be abstract (regardless of the prompt) and will change your idea herself to suit what she thinks is good. She also plays favorites and can be rude at times. Worst art teacher Ive ever had.",0
She might not be the best instructor but she really cares for her students & very understanding. She is still new & getting used to teaching; there is not much to teach in crit think & philosophy! It's all self-study. Gives good feedback and respectful towards students. A lot better than other teachers for the same courses in SAIT. Super Nice!!,1
"He is a very boring professor, he asks trick questions on the tests, he brags about people getting low grades on his tests, he makes study guides that have nothing to do with whats on the tests, theres little to no extra credit in this class, and he doesnt round up grades at the end of the semester",0
"Great professor. Attendance is required, but she likes group discussion participation so each day one person takes notes for the whole class and puts them on blackboard after Spaeth grades them (very helpful). Tons of information to cover but very interesting and well put together class. Would love to take another class with her.",1
Hes honestly my favorite professor from Suffolk. I had him once before in seminar and loved him so much. Everyone talks highly about him and the class is interactive and hes always around to help you whether its by email or face to face. All his stories are hilarious and everything applies to what hes teaching. You really have to try to fail.,1
"The worst class I have taken in my entire life, it's literally the middle of the semester but I can't stand this class. For heaven's sake DO NOT take this class, Spare yourself from stress.",0
"Falcon was an amazing professor, he is very intense but will change the way you think about the world. And he really genuinely cares about all of his students, he will spend time outside of class to discuss class topics you may be unclear on. Falcon is open about who he is and makes real connections to students. Just do the homework, and reading.",1
"Michelle is so friendly and helpful! Her test are challenging, but I learned so much and felt comfortable asking for help when I needed it!",1
"Dr. Kovach likes to structure his class as if though its the only class you are signed up for. His multiple choice questions on the exams only confuse you rather than test you on the literature. Unfortunately, he is more concerned with keeping up his reputation as the ""difficult"" professor which takes time away from actually teaching us.",0
She gives a lot of hw and grades VERY hard. Her tests are also very difficult. She cant teach very well in my opinion. She usually rambles a lot and teaches as if you are supposed to know the material. Also i feel that shes somehow passive aggressive. If you take the class just be ready to teach yourself because shes really no help.,0
"Dr Meglich was a terrible grader. She laughs with you in class and acts all friendly seeing you outside class but when it comes to grading she is just too terrible. Nobody got an A in her class and she didn't even give opportunity for B+ grades or A- grades she just stuck to the traditional A,B,C. I narrowly escaped a C. NEVER TAKE HER CLASS!",0
"Excellant teacher, will recommend.",1
correction to the previous post.Class is ADMS 3700,0
AWESOME Prof!!,1
"She's rude and very serious. She has a very strong accent that makes it very difficult to learn from her. She goes very quickly and with the combination of her speed and accent it makes taking notes difficult. There is 3 tests + a final, homework on every chapter. Do her test reviews and read the book and you'll be fine.",1
I took two classes with him. One was intro to visual basic and the other one was Internet Programming for Business.He is a very nice teacher and explain the material so well.One advice: if you do your homeworks and projects you pass easy. Tests: There are no trick questions.Just pay attention to what he says in class and read the book. A+ guarantee,1
"Terrible class. Prof is passionate about his own research, but is otherwise very monotonous and lectures regurgitate the textbook exactly - didn't even study lectures for exams, and skipped a bunch. Put in groups of 5-6 for projects that could have been done with 2-3 people tops. Most people just end up sitting around. Vague with instructions.",0
"She tends to deviate from the course material. She's funny and talks about her ferret. You can't really expect her to ""teach"" anything because it's just a review course and she gives a good amount of homework which is a good thing because you'll be prepared for the test if you do it sincerely. Use Think Tank.",1
"this class was oddly difficult for an elementary ed math class. we constantly had pop quizzes and worksheets for homework, which is doable. but on the tests, the problems were so much more complex than anything we had practiced. the point of this class was to learn how to teach elementary students and i don't feel like i learned how to do that.",1
"The class design makes grades heavily reliant on timed exams, which unfortunately are on applications of the assignments which no student would understand unless a student has taken the course or some equivalent before.  This places students who don't have the proper background at a disadvantage.  I learned a lot, but I'm worried about my grade.",0
"I wouldn't recommend taking this class with her if you have little background in stats. She assumes the class knows more than they actually do, so she tends to skip many steps when doing problems. She won't take responsibility for the class doing poorly (My class had a 62 average for exam 1 and said ""it wasn't her fault"")",0
"She makes chem so fun! Explains things in an easy, but not juvenile, manner. Would definitely recommend!",1
"This teacher needs to get a clue. I don't know if anybody passed this class with higher than a C.  I don't if she is trying to prove herself, but I seriously didn't learn anything because of her lack of teaching skills.  Essays questions don't make students learn, good teachers make them learn and this teacher doesn't make that mark. DON'T TAKE HER",0
Ms. Hunt is an awesome teacher. She makes the class a lot easier and funny. I would take her over and over again. We need more teachers like her.,1
Im sorry shes very nice to her students but her exams are just too hard for a 100 level class. The group projects will save you from failing. Dont take her unless you are good at geology or want to take a hit on your GPa.,0
"The midterm and final were comprised of exactly the same questions that were on the reviews, so if you study those well, you'll ace the tests. It's a difficult class that requires outside research if you want to make an A.",0
"Read a Ch. a week and do 15 T/F questions a week. Quiz every few chapters on all the HW questions. One Paper. Discussion Boards an must participate. Interesting reading, although, instructor has his own beliefs and the reading shows that. Entire text is on different philosophers beliefs which was unexpected to me. Do work get an A.",1
"Professor GZ is great! I wasn't sure if the flipped classroom would be right for me, but I was able to get used to it. You learn the material at home and review it in class, but Professor GZ will go over anything you have trouble with. She is very helpful and always available outside of class.",1
I absolutely loved having Professor Ippolito! We learned so much more than just how to give a speech! He really cares about each student and that is the first thing you will learn in his class. C.E.H.R. Be ready to learn all about that acronym!! He has a great way of teaching because he is more like your coach/mentor than your professor! Loved it!,1
"Professor I. was very understanding and patient with us all semester. She always changed due dates if we needed some extra help/time to finish. She removed a few topics from Exams that we didn't do well on. She answered questions respectfully and encouraged visiting in office hours. 75% of grade was exams, so a bit stressful but hard work paid off.",1
"A huge wieny. She made my life miserable. Her class policies suck and she is not understanding at all. I hated attending class and she barely even taught anything. She was rude, ignorant and did not even offer to help when my grade was failing. Never take her. It will be the worst decision you have ever made",0
"I love having Alisha. She always is willing to work with you and walk through steps that are confusing. Things can seem to be a lot in this class, but they really aren't that bad. When you have Alisha she always will make sure you succeed. Highly recommend!",1
"He will always stop to answer questions, but if you take good notes youll have all the answers you need. His lectures are heavy with the participation. Sometimes it seems elementary, he often refers the answer to something you learned on Sesame Street. Stick with him, you WILL comprehend his material. He even offered to help with other classes.",1
"Mackellar is one of the kindest teachers I've ever had. Even though it was online, he was still upbeat and positive. Class was easy. Simple 2 page paper due every week based off of 5 readings. The readings were primary, so they were difficult to read, but he graded easily and the papers were easy to write. 2 exams & they are straight from lecture. ",1
"He is a good professor, I'll take him again if there was ever a class I needed to take with him. He is there whenever you have trouble with a quiz.",1
"This is one of the best professors I had in my MBA program. He was able to convert the whole class into a team whose members would help each other and think ""out of the box."" Students can get a lot out of the time invested in the class. Professor James supports his students in any possible way and gives multiple opportunities to get a good grade.",1
"Great teacher; incredibly tough material.  Be prepared to work hard on hws. Exams are difficult but do-able; he doesn't give any hints as to whats going to be on them; pulls from class lectures,  an old textbook, hw, & recitations. Don't wait to get help if you need it.  Awesome class overall.",1
"Goes over material too fast, doesn't ever give out handouts to learn from. All he does is just talk and do quick problems on the board..",0
"Don't take a class with him. You learn nothing, because he knows nothing about the subject. Look elsewhere to fulfill your requirements.",0
Zwier is a very nice guy and great teacher. You can tell he enjoys what he's doing. A lot of people struggled with this class but as long as you stay up to date with what's  going on in class you will be fine. He also will help you out if you go into office hours.,1
"She's very kind, thoughtful, and easy-going. It's really easy to pass her class, I'd be surprised if anyone would fail her class, and when you miss a class, she has the powerpoints up just in case. She also gives amazing feedback, so it's always easy to know how much you've grown as a writer.",1
"Awful teacher. I can honestly say this is the worst teacher I have had in college. She speaks of critical inquiry and the importance of it, yet she can not give you an answer as to what it is. Her analogies are very poor and irrelevant to whats going on in class. She answers question with a question and often times doesn't answer yours. DO NOT TAKE",0
"He was a substitute for SPAN317. Even though he wasn't teaching his material, Prof. Newall still put in his best effort, was there for questions and concerns and made sure the class understood the materials before the exams. I really respect his dedication to the class.",1
She is great! Her exams require studying but she is super clear on what is on the exam. She doesn't take attendance. Just pass the test and you're fine,1
"Doesn't care about you, your life, or your grade. Lets the book and lab work do all the teaching.",0
One of the best professors at Keene State that I have had all 4 years of being here.  Makes a subject matter that would normally be boring very interesting with group work and interactive learning.  I highly recommend taking this class not only if you need it for your major but as an elective as well!,1
Dr. Zhao is an incredibly good professor. His notes are basically the exams. Offers a 5% boost to overall grade with easy EC assignments. Very helpful in office hours. Go to every single class and you will get a point back on each exam. The only difficult thing about this class was the ACS final. Put in the work and you will get a good grade.,1
"She interrupts students and is very harsh when she doesn't hear the answer she wants right  away. Her quizzes are filled with answers that are extremely similar, or mean almost the same thing which makes it hard to get a good grade on them. She is very picky when it comes to papers and gives a rubric which seems completely arbitrary.",0
"I absolutely love Hegner!!  She is the reason I am majoring in accounting and almost done with my degree at CSUS.  I wish Sac State had professors like her!  Absolutely amazing and really breaks down the material.  Pay attention, do the work, study, and you will do fine!  She really knows the material and knows how to TEACH!  Love you, Paula!",1
"Daria is a very slow and boring prof, You do not need to attend her classes because her 3 hour lectures are her taking up 4 question from the in class demo questions that is given at the end of every chapter. The midterm was easy but the final was hard. I learned nothing in the classes.",0
Super helpful with any and all questions. Will take time out of class to make sure everyone understands the material. Gives lots of review material and provides a lot of study information. Takes work and studying to get an A but great teacher!,1
"Not accessible outside class (and class was ONLINE!) Brings in a salesperson into lecture just so he can sell us LSAT prep material. I literally PAID to listen to an hour-long ad. Is strict on deadlines, while she herself never follows them. She gave us feedback on our papers 24 hrs before the final was due! Avoid this course. A true WASTE of money",0
"As a teacher myself, this guy could use some pedagogy classes. Sure, he knows the material, but can he teach? No. I had to practically teach myself. If you asked him a question he would belittle you in front of the whole class. I think he means well, perhaps he should be working with more advanced students, not amateurs. Avoid this class if possibl",0
There are no classes only discussions if a student can help host a zoom for him. There is no syllabus and it's stressful because there is no structure. He is a very sweet guy and tries his best to teach during these trying times but I don't recommend him for online classes. The only two things he's grading is a midterm and a final that's it.,0
I have enjoyed every single one of Professor Ferguson's classes. He knows the subject inside and out. You can tell that he enjoys his job and that makes a big difference. Show up with an open mind and you can very well expect to get new perspective and a laugh. He is definitely a professor who makes history a story which one can follow.,1
"Professor Hilke meant well but unfortunately his teaching style had a very negative impact on me. He was patient with the class but I often would listen, take notes, and leave without knowing what topic we were even going over. I'm not great at physics but it would help if the teaching was more direct. Also we used a different book from first term.",0
"This is the hardest English class I have ever had. I had another professor go over a paper with me, critiquing every sentence, and when I turned it in Mrs. Linder gave me a 70. I am normally a straight A student, especially in English. This professor has caused me to change majors.",0
She tends to talk a lot but i really loved her class. She has a fun and new way to look at IDSN. It's a very art heavy class.,1
"Also, the lectures are very boring. He thinks we are dumb and we don't know anything. He makes us feel like we are uneducated students. I have never felt so low in my life, I have always gotten A's in college except for his class. I recommend to him, respect your students because without students you are not a teacher.",0
"Compared to Wilson for Intro to music, she is probably 10 times harder, 10 times less helpful, and does not need to be teaching an intro class.  Its there for students to get an easy grade by doing a lil work, not the work required for a 3 or 4000 level class. Shes ridiculous.",0
"A nice prof who obviously cares, but extremely disorganized. Never prints enough copies of midterms, and once made 30 students leave and come take the exam a week later because of this. Changes his office hours without warning and regularly skips or reteaches material because he forgets what we've done. Easy class but stressful and frustrating.",0
Challenging class but I like the subject.,1
"Ibrahim was honestly THE worst experience I ever had at OU. Coming on here and seeing all these good reviews honestly makes me think they're completely fake and he wrote them himself (DONT BELIEVE EM). He teaches you nothing and his lectures are god awful, constantly all over the place, horrible at getting points across. Teach everything yourself.",0
She should not be a professor.  She is very confusing and nervous when teaching.  She jumps from topic to topic and literally makes the material confusing and does not even understand it herself.  If you want to learn chem do not take her.  Has no idea what she is doing and you will only learn from reading the book. she is nice but not a good prof.,0
"Pug is so awesome. She makes every class entertaining. She's always getting students engaged so that they don't fall asleep. Best professor I've had. Her exams are super easy, they're online and all the answers are in the book, so BUY THE BOOK",1
"He is one of my favorite profs. I highly recommend him to anyone, even if plants are not your thing. He is easy to understand and is always willing to re-explain for better understanding.",1
The weekly quizzes are unfair and nothing like the homework. You spend an average of 4 hours on homework a week. She is not a good teacher and doesn't explain the material well. Just a bad teacher. Avoid her unless you can teach yourself accounting and have a lot of free time in your schedule. ,0
"This guy knows so much about his topics. No book, just lecture. Show up and take notes on slides he doesn't post and get those attendance points. Take the class if you care about history. It's hard to get into the content (and the 4 or 5 books) if you don't. A bit harsh on the book response essays but it's clear what he wants answered.",1
This guy is a total jerk....Really offensive and demeaning.,0
"Don't take this class...ridiculous amount of material that all seems irrelevant. I'm not afraid of hard work...but 50+ pages per class period is a graduate course. He's rather rude, kinda degrading, his TA for the section is just as terrible and obnoxious so that didn't help. Listen to the ratings for this professor regardless of interest level.",0
Best teacher for music 105 I took this class online I highly recommend him.,1
Always give lots of examples on lecture. Homework is not too much. Some questions  in two Midterms are beyond the class (which will be taught on the next week). Ridiculous right?,1
"Miss Ayres can be a tough grader when it comes to essays, but she lets you do revisions to get your grade up. I enjoyed her novels and her lectures. Class topics was very interesting and some of her comments are really funny. I learned a lot of from her class and enjoyed it overall. A lot of reading is assigned, but I would take her again!",1
"Took freshman seminar with Climate Change topic. Although climate change is not at the top of my interests list, it ended up being super interesting and changing the way I view the topic of climate change. Class was small so got to know everyone. Super nice guy, would take again. Just expect some politics thrown in because of the topic....",1
"Very nice professor.  Professional, concise.",1
Took the course with him early in my Business program. One of the best profs for sure!,1
DO NOT TAKE. The PowerPoints she uses arent hers. Doesnt give you time to write down what is on the slide. Tells you you wont havent to memorize something for the test but then it will appear on the test. Has a thick accent so hard to understand if she does try to explain something,0
TONS of homework. I felt like I couldn't really approach her because she seems kind of tough. Never took any quizzes but the tests were super long. Very detailed syllabus and she expects nothing less than the best. I believe she helped me out in the end to pass the class but I would not take again. I struggled in this class,0
Goes on so many tangents. Lecture slides are not detailed. HW questions are made by him and so specific to what he says in class. I find it hard to learn in this class because he doesn't necessarily follow the textbook and there's not that much outside sources that help since its such a specific topic.,0
Rambles...,0
"Two weeks into class I dropped out because I had no time to complete my other assignments whatsoever. Lots of reading, lots of writing, and shes a tough grader. She will call you out in class. She does less teaching, and more talking. Will cite someone for plagiarism without warning. Everyone struggled. She had 30 students, then dropped to > 15.",0
"The amount of growth I've had from this class alone is AMAZING. Stef brings a different energy into the room... In a good way. She taught us how to be vulnerable actors with the Margolis Method, and I can honestly say I'm a totally different actor and person in general. She definitely cares about all her students. I would totally recommend !!!",1
"Lab is a easy A, just show up for the 3 hour lab. The classes you dont need to attend lecture but you do need to go on fridays classes becasue theres a quiz every friday on an article. You have 10 mins to complete it. You'll get 7/10, 10/10, 8/10 on most of them. 3 midterms (one counts as the final). answer the questions from lecture slides!",1
I would suggest those who are not major in Antropology please dont take classes with him. You are to read books of 350 pages or more for exams on the entire book.,0
"Dr. Giabbanelli takes down his rate my professors when they are bad, even though they are completely true. He is the most disrespectful professor I have ever had. He wanted graduate-level work in an undergraduate intro class. Do not take this professor if you value your time and mental health.",0
"Professor Farhat was one of the best professors I ever had at bergen. She is very caring and understanding, so dont be afraid to let her know when something is going on. She is very funny and She makes lectures super fun, as long as you show up, do the assignments, get her to know you youll be fine! Its really an easy A.",1
"Took this course online, I think it might have been easier to take in class. Decent marker, but is not really clear on expectations. Assigns 3, 8-paged papers, doesn't care what the content is only penalizes you if its not 8 pages. This course makes you think outside the box, prepare for many personal discussions with the rest of your classmates.",0
I loved her class.,1
The class component in this course wasn't bad it was pretty straightforward math. The labs on the other hand were the complete opposite. The midterm was even worse he literally tested us on the smallest things from our labs and then to top it off gave the LONGEST integration question known to man as the final question!!!!,0
Knowledgeable,1
"She's nice but really annoying. Her lectures are long and pretty boring, her tests are usually completely different from what she says they'll cover in the study guides, and she grades papers harshly and only gives A's if she sees what she wants to see. Don't take if possible!!",0
"College Algebra. Quizzes everyday, but only your best 10 are averaged and the rest are dropped. Homework everyday, 3 tests worth 50% and the final is 33% of your grade. Goes pretty fast in class so if you arent the best at math dont take it. About half the class dropped, shell answer questions but she arent very clear",1
I took her for English 1010. She gives a lot of feedback on your essays but one thing that would help you would be knowing the attendance policy by heart. I missed a couple of classes due to emergencies and I automatically failed the class. READ THROUGH HER SYLLABUS,0
"While taking this class required for the Nursing program, I would have liked to actually been taught something. He does not give any lectures at all. If you want to teach yourself everything about nutrition, he's the professor to have. I feel like I could have just bought a nutrition book and learned the same amount I did in this class.",0
"If you are a student with accommodations do not take this professor ! When simply informing her about my accommodations of extra time she acted completely unprofessional and did not understand why I needed this extra time, when clearly I have a reason approved by the SSD office! Terrible experience all around!",0
"She did a video presentation at the beginning of each week, but did not really explain anything just read off the instructions that we can do, not really going into depth. Also, didn't really answer the questions on the discussion boards, I learned the answers to things from other students in the class. It was not clear what her expectations were.",0
"doesnt take attendance which is awesome....basically your grade only depends on the 5 tests over the semester, you pass those your fine..homework is easy,he goes over it in class and you can get your answers there and i loved that he gave you credit on tests for trying even if you got the wrong answer, but he was really softspoken hard to hear",0
"You can tell that she has good intentions, but she simply does not teach the subject well. If you don't go into this class with a very thorough background in Chemistry, you're not going to have a fun time.",0
"HE was horrible, I hated his class, never returned assignments and made us to stupid random stuff, I will never take him again",0
"He's 'flamboyant'  so be prepared for that. His lectures are useless, the papers are vague and difficult and he grades very strangely. I've never had an issue with writing, and in fact enjoy it, but he seems to find an issue with everything I submit, and gives nonsensical reasons for the deductions. If you're an engineer, not a poet- stay away.",0
"Dr. Autry has become my favorite first semester teacher. He has a true heart of gold. Don't be fooled by the number of people watching movies around  you. Go to the front and listen in. You'll be amazed at the gold nuggets he slips in. My margins are full of one-liners quoted from his lectures. Plus, A couple classes he sang us a song he wrote! 3",1
"Professor Canedo structured this in a way that most students will either barely pass or fail. Quizzes are 8 questions, each worth 5 points, and they are based off of a reading of 50+ pages. No study guide. He won't work with you or consider your feedback. If you can avoid taking this class with him, please do so for your peace of mind and good gpa.",0
"Professor Rodriguez is a nice guy. He is a bit radical for my liking; however, what do you expect from a diversity professor? The class requires that you buy two books. DON'T. Save your hard earned CASH. All of the answers to the 3 tests are on the PowePoints. There is one simple ""term paper"" due at the end of the semester. Take this class! Easy A!",1
"he goes through outlines everyday in clas but if you havent read the assigned reading before the class you have no idea what hes talking about. He makes something easy way over complicated, and his tests are HARD. you literally have to know the stuff forwards and backwards to get it.DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS",0
"ridiculous grading. Math is universal, but not for him. You not only have to learn math, but also HIS math. He wants you to copy exactly as he does it. Very discouraging as he states that not even D is guaranteed. Avoid. He says and believes that calc is hard and that most people will fail. If you want to succeed, get someone that believes you can.",0
If you want a decent professor that will actually teach you something about plants avoid this professor. The only thing she will do is confuse you with her disorganized PowerPoint slides and drop your grade with her tests that don't test anything we cover in class. whatever she teaches you is not tested. study guides are USELESS,0
Yeah just stay away from this Professor! Really hard to understand her directions at times I wish she would communicate more effectively with her students. Not bad but I would not take her again if I had the choice.,0
"Of all the classes I took online, sociology was my favorite! I am a pre-med major and this course gives you an insight into the different problems we face as a society, but this professor made the weekly discussions meaningful instead of having you repeat the information from the textbook. Highly recommend she is a very nice lady!",1
This professor will not reply to your emails and never sent out emails regarding our assignments. Our class was left with nothing and his syllabus was super unclear. He cut class short due to COVID-19 but never graded any of our work; even as a I write this I dont know my grade in the course due to his poor involvement with the class.,0
"Professor Hanna seemed cool at the beginning of the semester, and then she showed her true colors. Rude professor in all honesty. She wasnt a very understanding person, especially during the online transition from in person lectures to zoom classes. She will not round your grade. Called students who asked for a rounded grade annoying and entitled.",0
"I had English with Lori at HCC, and I loved her. I think she is a great teacher, even though she gets off topic a lot and seems a bit lost with her assignments. She's always smiling and full of energy. Be prepared to write many short stories and essays. Would recommend her.",1
"Do you enjoy being belittled, laughed at or talked to like you are 5? Then Professor Randle is the gal for you! Please, take anyone else. Even if it delays your gradation.",0
"she is very nice and helpful. At first, I thought she must be very hard, but actually she is super nice~!!",1
Laura makes the very heavy and difficult course material interesting. She manages comments in the class well and provides a safe space for difficult topics. Love this prof! Hope to take more of her classes.,1
"Really great teacher... his take on electronic music, its composition, and history has definitely opened doors for me in terms of writing & listening to music. His approach to teaching is skillful, plus he's a pretty chill dood.",1
"She's a good person and cares about her students, but her lectures are off a power point that she quickly goes through.  Make sure you print out the chapter outlines and follow her with those or else you could easily get lost during lecture.  Do the quizzes, they will help your grade!  Also, her exams are mainly fill in the blank and short answers.",1
"Fun class with awesome materials. Nice person, but grading (in absolute scale, not curve) makes this class very difficult. Take astr323 when Gelco(Zeljko) is teaching.",1
"Be ready to dive into the readings! They are absolutely mandatory, and you will be lost if you do not read them. Especially when it comes to the tests, since the questions are not obvious ones. But overall, a nice, very interesting professor.",1
"Prof. Scaltriti was honestly THE best Professor I have ever had. He is a native speaker with a sexy accent, so that made class more enjoyable. On the plus side, he is very handsome and that was a good motivation to study Italian. I hope I will have him next year! He is THE man!",1
Easy class. The test questions are exactly the same as the study guide in the back of the book. Class can get a little boring sometimes but its mostly because its a 3 hour class. She's funny and her accent is great.,1
Ryan was a chill professor to have for 3001. He genuinely wanted his students to pass and was obviously interested in the material. I really enjoyed his class and would definitely recommend him!,1
"This prof also runs the skills lab and does not do anything for the students. She spends most of the time socializing with co-workers while she ignores students in the lab, or kicks them out for a hair appt. BTW the lab hours are always scheduled during class so you can never go. Completely useless...",0
"Hey Rhodes students, I'm not one of you, I go to Creighton, where Dr Bakewell used to teach. Just saying you guys are really lucky to have him and I hope you appreciate him! He truly loves to teach and I just wanted to let you know you're getting the very best. =)",1
"Chisholm is very ""sarcastic"" with students, gives little instruction, and is an unreasonable grader. I would not take him again.",0
He is the best teacher I have EVER had! He really loves what he teaches and you can see his passion for the subject. If you don't understand something he is ALwAYS there to help...you just need to ask. The study sessions before the tests are amazing and so helpful. The tests are easy if you study everything on the study guide and I mean everything.,1
"Sara was my lab teacher my freshman year for CHE 131. Definitely take her if you get the chance! She's young, fresh, and relatable she understands this isn't easy stuff and is there for you 100%. Have a question about your lab report or grade? Talk to her and she'll make time for you. Also, I took her at night from 6-9pm and highly recommend it! ",1
"Dr.Newman is seriously THE WORST. First off, genetics has been nothing but reading outdated papers about Cystic Fibrosis. Secondly,she does NO amount of teaching. She believes that learning from peers and teaching yourself is more beneficial. Neither of which am I paying thousands of dollars for. If you can avoid having a class with her, do it.",0
"Professor Campbell was amazing in his lectures because he shares his personal experience a lot, and teaches the material well, using case discussion (light) and getting people to participate. He kept classes short (online) but perfectly covered everything we needed. His notes and online book was good material for all projects/exam. Would take again",1
"Jim is, by far, the best professor I have ever had. He expects students to think critically, but he is there every step of the way to help. He is accessible, and welcomes students to stop by his office if extra help is necessary. If you do not take one of Jim's classes in your time at SCC, you will have missed one of the school's greatest assets.",1
"Essay prompts are pretty ridiculous but not impossible to get done. In-class presentations do not help in any way, but she seems to think they do. Journal Entries aren't entirely difficult, just a waste of time and unnecessary. Not bad, but I would NEVER take her class again. Terrible teacher.",0
This class was ridiculous! I am a senior and a psychology major and this is by far the most difficult and boring class I have taken at UT. I highly recommend not taking this class!!!,0
kind of intimidating when you first meet him but if you show interest in the class he is willing to help you however he can.  makes you work really hard but teaches you alot.  great professor.,1
"Thought having an online class the professor wouldn't matter b/c you teach yourself, but I have never had a more unclear, rude, demeaning professor in my life. Unclear grading along with the worst feedback and no room to do better unless you harass her with emails asking what you did wrong and how to improve and she replies so nasty 5 days later.",0
"SHE IS SO AWESOME. She is caring and so funny. She even plays Spanish songs at the end of each class . We dance sometimes, too! I would retake her classes 100 times if i could.",1
"She takes 30 min to explain an assignment that could be explained in 5 min--incredibly boring and redundant. In-class assignments every day so you must show up. You'll hate being in class, but the final paper is only 6 pages. 5 papers including one group essay. $50 textbook was only used 4 times. You just need the bare minimum for writing skills.",0
"I'm not the best at English and my test scores showed it, but I have learned quite a bit in this class. I feel my punctuation and grammar has improved. The work lode in this class can be over whelming at times, especially as a working parent. I wish she would show a little more leniency with attendance.",1
"I had her for both lecture and lab. She was great for the lectures: her powerpoints and videos were detailed and helpful. With the lab however, she graded extremely hard and did not give helpful feedback. I would not take her again due to this as it brought my overall biology grade down.",1
"I took her Child Development class over the summer. The 40 question chapter homeworks seemed so easy until you really got into them. There is always more than one right answer (all taken right out of the book) and you just have to guess which one she says is ""most correct"" what a joke! She never replies to emails, tests arent like homework. ugh.",0
Zimmerman threw the syllabus out the door in the first couple of weeks of class. She would switch deadlines and move points around because she forgot to give us a midterm. This class was not made a priority. My advice: avoid her and this class at all costs during the rest of COVID. The only positive thing I can say is that she responds to emails.,0
"The communication is a very big problem. Although understanding, this professor does not respond within the maximum amount of time given, then leaving you to figure out for yourself how to manage the assignments. It was as if I did not have a professor at all for this class and I was completely self sufficient. Not a great experience.",0
"MTE 1 - 4 I'm slow with math &  hate it but she made it easy for me to learn. Not recommended if you already know your stuff. She will baby step & make sure everyone understands. Book not needed, MTE code is cheaper. hw is posted ahead of time. Gives extra credit. Weekly tests. Don't miss class or be late. Creates foundation needed for math",1
She is so helpful,1
"Dr. Scanlon was one of the most helpful professors I ever had.  He expects you to work, and he is not easy.  If you work hard you he will take care of you.",1
I took her class twice and found out there was other people in the same class that took her class twice. I notice people dropping her class with complaints I truly thought I was doing great in her class to find out I got a D at the end of the semester now I have to retake the class before I can take any other my classes ,0
THIS INSTRUCTOR LOVES TO FAIL STUDENTS! His temperament is not suitable for teaching a introductory painting class. Their grading scale and attendance policy is very strict. This instructor ruined my GPA. THEY TALK ABOUT FAILING STUDENTS IN CLASS!,0
"Tom seemed difficult to like at first, but once you get to know him he's pretty cool! It's super important that you stay on top of your work though. There are only 4 tests, including the final, which count for 80% of your grade. There's also a few essays to do and you have to attend 5 events. If you put in the work for the class, you'll be okay.",1
"It is nearly impossible to understand him and he does not know how to really teach. He may be smart but he is an awful teacher(he spends the entire class time explaining the same thing 12 times, saying the exact same thing over and over again, but not actually clarifying anything.)You're only chance is if a classmates knows it and can teach you.",0
Mrs. Henderson is the best teacher I've ever had. As a clinical instructor she is tough and caring. She is very comfortable with students being independent and is always there for support.,1
"I took class with him .... the you really need to be regular in math classes especially with Martin.. His quizes and exams are really easy but his teaching method is terrible cus he only understands for himself.. pay more attention when he teaches row reduction, span,bases, eigen value etc...",0
I do not know where to began because this teachers thinks shes a math god but she really is not good at teaching math at all. She gives you more than 100 math problems per week for homework where like other math teachers I had taken pass gives less than 60 math homework problems. Really a rude teacher that sleeps and can't teach.,0
"She's adorable but she does have her moments of sarcasm which come off a little rude. She provided us with a website to access the online textbook for free. We had 3 speeches which were straight forward for the most part, study for quizzes and tests cause that'll certainly help your grade! Overall I hated presenting but its not too bad if you prep.",1
Dr. Teekell is super fun. She is incredibly personable and does her best to make the class as interesting and engaging as possible. There aren't many papers assigned and you do a lot of work in class to prepare for them. There is a lot of assigned reading that you discuss in class the next day and she may randomly call on you.,1
"Dr. Gilyard is an awesome, albeit intimidating scholar. He is knowledgeable about his content and doesn't mind sharing his wisdom gleaned throughout the years. He is a hardworking professor who can, at times, appear hard/harsh, but I assure you his classes will not disappoint. He's a great school/teacher, someone I truly look up to.",1
Not very accessable and she's hard to get on with. Don't take the online version of this class as it's hard to get a clear answer and there's no leeway.,0
Ms. Murnighan is an amazing teacher. She makes sure students understand what is going on in class. Class discutions are great. I wish she taught all the business classes I needed.,1
"Do not take him for the psychology methods class. Very disorganized, slow grader, cannot remember the class subjects, forgets to grade things and expects you to move forward anyway, contradictory and unclear instructions, made it very very hard to pass. Do not take if you have a Mac, all the files are PC only, therefore, you will not pass the class",0
"this class is actually insane. I have taken 200, and 300 level online psychology classes so I figured why not take an easy 100 level class online. DON'T DO IT. This professor expects work from graduate students and will never ever give you full credit. One comment she gave me was ""You need to cite all of your work, regardless if it is an opinion.""",0
"She's incredibly cool, Spanish and languages just happen to be something I'm not all that great at, super understanding though. Does Test Reflections so you can get more points, gives tons of tutoring and resources for more. Even if you're utterly horrid at Spanish like me if you work decently hard you'll do good in this class.",1
I took a course that was taught by professor Sinha and two other professors and her part of the course was the most confusing and least informative. I can see her efforts but I honestly did not think it worked out in the end and a lot of people I know struggled through the course because of her.,0
He is the BEST!!! TAKE HIM! SIMPLE! He makes Math easy and fun!!! Def recommend this guy.  Also hes crazy funny!,1
Great professor.,1
"I love John Creed with my whole heart. I have never had to work harder for a class, but it has made the learning experience so much better. He is truly a staple for the political science department and I highly recommend him to all students. You will read more than any other class that semester, but you will learn so much. He truly loves his job.",1
"He is an amazing professor. This class does require some basic knowledge of math but not pre-cal or cal knowledge. If you struggle, go to office hour early and ask for help. I went to his office hour often and he made me felt that I was welcomed there. Be prepare for tests. Mid terms were alright. Final was hard but he gave hints at the end.",1
"prof maizel gives WAY too much homework (expect to receive an assignment EVERY class). if you SKIP, your grade will be determined based upon your PARTICIPATION, so DO NOT skip class. he has a HEAVY accent, that makes directions UNCLEAR, and RARELY responds to emails (if he does, expect to reply back the way he expects you to -- CORRECTLY).",0
"Super easy class, just come to every class to get the participation mark. His practice tests are literally the exact same as his actual tests. He's very monotone and boring. You can literally learn everything by yourself using the textbook.",0
I would totally take Hinton for every Biology course if I could! She was amazing! I loved her! She is so caring and hilarious! She goes off of topic a lot but make sure you show up to the reviews! Make sure you study the reviews because they are JUST like the tests (like word for word). Answer questions and she will give you bonus points :-),1
"Dr. Brown was awesome. He really is passionate about what he teaches, and he makes his class easy to understand. Heavy work load but a lot of it is very interesting and he goes over everything in class. He really cares about his students and is a really great professor. I would definitely take him again.",1
"This guy does really messed up things like give problems on tests that use notations youve never ever seen before, or material you've never seen before. Need to put a lot of effort in to pass, but he does know what hes talking about and will help you if you go to his office hours. Does not curve and is the most unfair teacher in math department.",0
He is probably the chillest teacher Ive had.,1
"Prof Cramer is super friendly & really passionate, & his lectures are participation based which makes it more interesting than if he were to just sit & talk about art. Funny too! Lots of reading but it enforces the content. I was kind of dreading this class and I walked away loving it. Just do the work, pay attention, & there's no way you wont pass",1
"Carlton is an AWESOME professor! 135/136 is taught differently than his other classes, more laid back but still gives you lots to do. He encourages you to submit your work again and again and is very thorough with feedback on your piece. I don't think I took a single test, just wrote all semester long, and it was things I actually wanted to write!",1
"This man made coming to W&L worth every penny. I wish I could have taken more than two classes with him. He is nice, reasonable, and wants students to come talk to him. Professors like him are the reason W&L is such a great place.",1
This class was intresting and layed out really well.,1
"Great professor, his lectures are content heavy but in no way are they boring. I missed a couple of classes and he was more than happy to help and very understanding about making up work you might have missed. He gives an extension for one writing assignment on a monograph of your choice! 10/10 would take again!",1
"This guy is useless. I took his online class and he never helped you and was a real jerk. He felt as if he was invincible when speaking over e-mail. Oh well, what else do you expect when a coach teaches?",0
"GREAT MATH INSTRUCTOR! Very helpful and extremely nice. Kinda cute and pretty funny, too. Take Stats with Professor Fry for sure!",1
Awesome professor and awesome class.  Lot's of fun and you learn a lot from his experiences.  He tells some great stories.,1
"Ning is difficult, nigh impossible to learn from.  He outright lacks the ability to communicate ideas clearly,  does not set clear expectations or plans for his course, jump from topic to topic while teaching, repeats himself over and over again (and not in a helpful way) and just appears to be doing the absolute minimum required as a teacher.  ",0
"Don't get me wrong, it's an easy class worth an easy A, Especially if you don't have much of an issue with speaking in front of people. Wolfe is a great professor, and he has the best interest and intentions for all if not most of his students, and I appreciate that. My only criticism is that his his assignment structure is a bit unorganized.",1
Lots of work in this class but I thought it was very unlike any other class I've taken here. I can see why some don't like her but I found her to be an interesting prof. You HAVE to go to class though because there's lots of extra credit and quizzes. The tests are long and hard and there's a group project that makes up a lot of your grade.,1
"One of the more entertainIng classes I've had. 2 essay tests straight from the readings (which are dry), two 3 page papers, and a conference review. He's unapologetically himself, which tends towards the self-congratulating, unhelpful side of things. I don't think anything else could be said but that I would definitely without a doubt take it again",0
"Rebecca is hands down the best instructor at COCC. She knows what it takes for a student to actually learn the information from the course, and she teaches in a way that is engaging, contemporary, and fun. She makes it seem like we're all learning together and like we could all just be friends and have conversations about sociology. Take her class!",1
"Never and I mean NEVER take this professor. She is a very kind lady, but doesn't teach well. ""What does the book say?"" is her favorite line when you need help. Labs are unorganized and no one had any clue what they were doing. I am a good student and tried my hardest to understand, but it was just impossible. I had to withdrawal.",0
"I know the bad ratings for Stone; I was in the class with no curve. This is my honest opinion-the class can be passed, even with an A, but don't have any other hard classes because you'll need lots of study time. I didn't get lots of study time, but I studied without believing in a final curve, so I got a C- That curve is not assured, so study.",0
"I really wish I would not have taken this professor. Luckily for me, since I failed I can choose a different one next time. Simnet is fine,  easy to use and helpful. I got A's and B's on all the online assignment. My problem was that I had an out of state emergency and could not get the courtesy of a response back from Mr. Douglas re: a makeup.",0
"Online class. quick response. Over all very nice. Interesting course. He says you don't need a text book because he writes his own lessons but a some test Q's are not mentioned in his version but they are in the practice quizzes. DO THE PRACTICE QUIZZES 20+ TIMES IF YOU WANT TO PASS. only graded on 5 things( 3 exams, a paper and final)",1
"Avoid him with all costs. He is talented in making easy and simple things into very complicated lectures. He might have been great as an airport manager, but he is not so good at teaching. His lectures can be more organized and sequential. You'll have to go back and forth on your notes adding information to previous notes.",0
"Overall, OK professor. His main deficiency is he doesn't provide a lot of examples to clarify the material. The textbook is literally the worst book I've ever read in my life. Thankfully, the bulk of his exams come from the notes. HW is copy+paste. Depending on the class average, curve can be legendary. Summary: better than average EE professor.",1
"I really liked his portion of the class because he was very easy to listen to because he was just so lively and passionate about genetics, RNA in particular. I also really liked his slides because he underlined the key points which made it very easy to study off of for the exams. He is a great professor all around. Highly recommend!",1
"I had Dr. Burck at Walden University for Psychopharmacology. He is extremely difficult. Always late at submitting grades, and not helpful at all… I never could understand what he wants as a “good paper”. He never gives any explanation for anything!",0
Attend every class. There were 3 quizzes total instead of a midterm. As long as you do all your readings and follow the instructions she gives you for the paper you will definitely get an A. She also gives extra credit.,1
"Horrible professor. I would say in my 5 years at WestConn that she is the second worst professor I've ever had. Her lectures give NO information, her exams are not even based on her power points. Out of the entire class, on our exams, the highest exam grade was a 73. Also, she is very rude and judgmental. No information learned. Horrible.",0
by far the EASIEST science teacher! she's nice and funny. she tends to get off topic BUT its related to the topic. she WANTS you to bring in a cheat sheet for EVERY test.,1
"I recieved an A in this class rarely looking at the book or his lecture notes from the bookstore. His lecture may seem all over the place but he does cover almost all the powerpoints he posts in some way, so there is a method to his madness. My advice, take microbiology or finish the freshman bio series first, than this class is takeable. ATTEND!!",1
"We had a new reading every week, and it was a lot of reading. He likes class discussion a lot so come prepared. Discussion helps with papers. He did 3-4 group projects, 5 essays, and then exams were also essays. I like him as a professor, I just didn't like every book he gave. I'm a slow reader and some were very dense.",1
"Biased professor, very egotistical.  Must spit back his own opinions on papers and tests or you will get a bad grade.",0
speaks very fast and is unclear. copying the notes from her lecture slides before or after class is helpful and simply doing the examples in class. would not take another class with her.,0
"Love the course content, found content I didn't attend lectures for to be difficult to catch up on. It was also difficult to obtain a great grade on assignments due to how broad the rubric and criteria were- however, this depends on your TA.",1
"My most challenging class so far. Professor Q. does not play.  World Mythology is not an easy class. I always have a workload of homework. However, he prepares for what is to come. Might as well get used to a heavy load of homework. That's what college is about anyway.",1
"Save your GPA, don't take Casimir. He's a nice guy and you can tell that he's very intelligent but he isn't a great teacher. You barely hear him when you sit up front and he explains terribly. His quizzes and homework are okay, and he goes over them but his tests are so hard! He always gives partial credit though. Just be safe, and don't take him!",0
"For world literature there seemed to be a lot more work than I had expected. Every week a quiz and discussion post due, as well as four essays. If strong accents are something you have a hard time with in the learning environment, I would avoid this professor. The notes she writes on the board can also be hard to follow as well.",1
Don't ever take him. Its a terrible experience.,0
"She is the worst professor I have ever had. She does not explain anything. She works the problem and assumes you understand. Never ask a question in her class you will MAKE FUN OF YOU! For not understanding. I hate going to her class, but I know that I have to go in order to pass.",0
Eileen is a phenomenal teacher! She knows her stuff and has a talent for picking the perfect song to complement your voice. I took lessons with her for 3 yrs and I went from so so to getting rave reviews on my singing. If you do not practice you're gonna get it when you see her and she will criticize you. She gives praise when praise is due. <3 her,1
she's the worse,0
Hes a VERY nice man. However hes unclear about his expectations and was very unorganized during class. Being a Spanish major who will be studying in Spain for a semester I am looking for a class that will challenge my Spanish skills and this class did not do so at all. I feel as if I learned very little from this class. I will NOT take him again.,0
"He asked us for our opinion and I rarely do evaluations. However, I felt compelled to do one for Professor Hercules-Menjivar. He is by far one of the best professors I've had in my three years at NJIT. The class moves a bit fast, but he never leaves you behind (unless you don't ask questions). He tries to make the best of every lecture.",1
U will be shocked of his TOO complicated & unorganized syllabus! he says it is 3 short writing assignments short means(2500-3000 words)also u need to do a project with many requirements. U need to write one analysis paper (MC) as HW every week. he let u do Lots of reading then he never talk about what u read. u will be confused of what he wants.,0
Don't take any mathematical class with him he will let you hit the wall my recommendation take with anyone else but not with him .,0
Lectures are engaging Content is interesting He is passionate and knowledgeable,1
"This class did not feel like an intro class. 4 exams and 3 papers, and worksheets that were basically quizzes in discussion. The material he presents was very, very heavy and a lot to process. Gives study guides for exams but it wasn't much help. Exams were tough! goodluck",0
"Professor Hinshaw is simply an amazing person. His class was phenomenal. He is one of the most engaging lecturers I've encountered at Cal and a truly good person. Office hours were such a joy, and I always left with some nugget of wisdom. I wish this class were a year long. I would take any class with this professor! He's one-of-a-kind.",1
"Before coming to college, I heard horror stories about crazy professors who didn't care if you got an A or an F. Dr. Hauck proved those stories wrong. He set time outside of class to help me understand all of the material I didn't understand. His tests were straightforward if you paid attention during lecture, and he was super fun in lab. Take him!",1
"Awful grader. Takes off points for not doing it exactly as he instructs although you understand the problems and your work is in general correct. Don't take him, he will ruin your GPA. If you want to have a good experience at SMC with math professor you need to join the scholars program, otherwise you'll get professors like Mr. Konya. Unfortunately",0
Professor Neva knott has time and time again has shown her inability to teach by not supporting her student when they excelled in something they previously struggled with. When you ever asked for her help she only responded with not only a rude manner but also more confusing then the prompt she gives. Do not take her class if you ever need help.,0
Loved him! He gets your attention with his lectures! He tells you exactly what's on the midterm and final and it's all from lectures and the textbooks. He's also a fair grader. If you deserve a 90 he gives you one.,1
"It's the exact same course as GOV 2301. This guy has a really awful voice and likes to yell at his captive audience. You will be forced to hear about his neighbor's noisy pool pump, Ugg the Thug, and how stupid Sarah Palin/Charlie Sheen/Tea Party/anyone who disagrees with prof. is. Quizzes are easy, answers are online.",0
"She's definitely the most condescending, rude, garbage prof I have ever had. Shes so patrionizing and sorry honey but if you are going to class with your hair electrocuted and hideous old navy sweats, go and fix your life. she can just drop out of unviersity because she is the worst educator. profs shouldnt make you feel dumb.",0
"Ghent stood up in class one day and said that ""immigrants and women have no place in geology"". 50% of the class was female; another 50% was visible minorities. We formed a study group and all aced the class. Avoid him or make human-rights complaints - the guy's an ass.",0
Terrible Teacher. This is a computer programming class yet we did zero programming. The class involves doing journal entries on the chapter and occasionally we have to do assignments. This doesnt seem bad but the problem is he expects you to know code for the exams which by the way are impossible. The highest grade on our midterm was a 73. ,0
"Nice but seems unorganized and unprepared. Essay assignments make no sense. Unnecessarily repetitive. The class was online for me, so it could be different in person.",0
"Professor Stahl is very helpful. If you show her that you want an A and you put the time in, then she will give you what you deserve. I loved getting to know her this semester and highly suggest her as a professor.",1
I really liked this seminar! She is friendly and helpful. I would recommend this to students who want to really understand Japan and East Asia in general.,1
"I had Professor Whitney for Psych Lifespan and Social Psych. She is a great professor she really cares about her students. She can go off topic from the lecture for sure, she post her powerpoints so it really helps for test. Great teacher but if you can't handle her going off topic or pushing due dates for test and papers back at times, don't take",1
BEST MATH TEACHER EVER!! Take her!,1
I hated this class I wish I dropped it.,0
Highly interactive class. Cares for his students.,1
"So long as you attend each class and participate by answering one or two of her questions or reading some of a passage from the textbook you'll do good. The class itself was easy to follow, just complete your homework and show her that you did and you'll get an A.",1
Dr. Meade is probably the  least caring professor I have ever had here at Appalachian State. I took his English2060-Great Books course and was very dissatisfied. He will send VERY rude and passive aggressive emails when asking simple questions about simple assignments. He will assign your midterm three days prior with no review. STAY AWAY FROM HIM,0
Discrete Probability,1
"Great teacher, uses every resource available to help teach!!! Keep up the good work Brett!",1
"Professor Amey means well, but he tends to talk for what seems like hours and you never know what exactly you need to know. The only things you are graded on are pop quizzes, usually once a week, assignments that you get full credit for just by handing them in, and a final which is essentially made up of questions from all the quizzes.",1
"Sensei Morales is one of a kind, seriously! He cares so much for all of his students which is the most important thing a professor can do, aside from making learning fun and easy esp a foreign language (WHICH HE DOES TOO!!!) 10/10 will be taking JPN 1121 with him. YOU WILL LEARN JAPANESE!",1
"His online class is super difficult if you fall behind with the material. Quizzes (Chapters 1-17) 40%, Midrerm (Chapters 1-8) (200pts) 30%, and Final (Chapters 9-13, 16-17) (200pts) 30%. Honestly, a lot of work and memorization. Practice Exams are nothing like the midterm or final. Waste of time. Take him in person, or don't take him at all!",0
"This guy is a donkey. I will never in my life on earth take this class again with him teaching it. He don't offer extra help In lab, you have to beg for it. He make rude comments trying to be funny. The professor takes mechanical pencils way too serious. Can't use regular pencils or pens. There was 6 people remainding out of 30 students. HEART LESS",0
This class is a complete waste of my time. i actually counted one day and in the hour and fifeteen minutes we were in class we got through a half of page of notes and the rest of the time is spent on whatever pops into her mind at the moment. great glass for an elective becasue she gives you the notes for her quizzes so you'd have to try to fail.,0
"I had Kim for lecture and lab. She's amazing in lab, but dismal in lecture. She would go off on tangents, then speed through the remaining slides expecting you to understand everything. Her final was filled with mechanisms she told us about last minute. If you try to get points back, don't expect her to be nice. Hard HW. Very unprepared for 3020:/",0
"Makes several mistakes, doesn't give breaks and gets aggravated if someone gets up to use the restroom, very condescending, rushes through materials, doesn't properly explain mathematical rules and applications, every chapter I used kahn academy to figure out the ""lesson"" plan avoid at all cost",0
"The assignments given were very confusing, and not much information is given to complete the assignments. I would not take this class if you are looking for a GPA booster as you put in a lot more work than expected for a first-year course. Would not recommend.",0
"Good prof overall, however she should have included more of her own slides instead of the textbook slides. It would of been more interesting that way.",1
"Makes me feel so dumb. Yells at kids for not asking questions, then when someone does ask he says I just went over that or makes it seem like the answer is so easy. Basically no homework, just tests and quizzes, and the final is only 12% of our grades. Not accessible and always finds a way to be passive aggressive.",0
Read homework. Do the essays. She does not b s. Around in class. Tough but fair.  Expects students to be serious and will call out those who act stupid. Not a class for immature idiotsdoes not give out class notes. Take good notes. Don't email her with 1000 excuses why you can't come to class. If you can't come to class its your grade going down.,1
"I took this because I am a nurse and feel it's important to be educated on social problems. He only focused on the perspectives of sociology, never actually ""taught"" anything. Discussion boards were all opinion based, but still never able to get full credit. Unless you are majoring in Sociology, I would steer clear of this professor.",0
"idk what to say theres 0 connection between her and students everything is done by the tas, she will stop by tutorials and is easy to set up meetings with but she will tell u 1 thing and that ta will say another, the course is disorganized but at least u don't even gotta pay attention to the lectures cus no final exam or midterm",0
"Great teacher. Attendance is mandatory, but every class is awesome so it's not an issue. You learn a ton about the making of films and how to get more out of them. You watch a full movie in almost every class, and always tons of relevant clips. Teaches everything well, too. Can't go wrong with him.",1
"She is a great professor. Get ready to read, do your works on time and pay attention in class you will get A. she cares about her students and helps them to do well and provides feedback to improve.",1
"He is a really old style teacher and he is lecture heavy. There are only exams in the grade book so if you fail one, you already have a lower grade. He has no homework or light quizzes. Take him if you are good in lectures and exams and won't fall asleep.",0
"Glenn Smith is, simply put, an angle of a man. Truly passionate about constitutional law, he genuinely cares about the education of each of his students. Participate in his class and he'll appreciate it. I am taking him in a course simulating the Supreme Court, smaller than his usual lectures, and he is very accommodating. Funny too!",1
"If your were good at calc 1,2 then you should be good for his calc 3 class. I barely even tried and i got a B. His lectures were boring and his exams were long. Webassign will teach you more than him.",1
"He is smart but moves extremely fast and does not like to answer questions. Gets annoyed and raises his voice after one or two questions. No real reviews for tests or final. Gives comprehensive final without telling what will be on it. I would NOT recommend to anyone, especially if weak in math.",0
"He gives terms to look up, these terms are never on the quizzes.  For mid-term study guide he gave a list of 75 terms, not one of them was on the test.  It is hard to know what to study for this class because there is so much information and the ""study guides"" that he gives are misleading since none of the information is actually on the exams.",1
"This class was very interesting and Meyer did a good job to teach it. He put together a good syllabus & was easy to understand even though I have no philosophy background, and he facilitated good class discussions. But, I don't really like the guy, he has a big ego, loves his own ideas, and sometimes makes students uncomfortable.",1
Great instructor! Will review a problem until you get it. Has an accent but not difficult to understand.,1
she hardly helped with any questions I asked over email. Her powerpoint lectures don't really help with the tests because she asks tough detailed questions from it. Her assignments are pretty straight forward but her interaction with students is poor so you have to be good with teaching yourself the material given,0
"Have him this semsester for 200. Overall the class really isn't that tough if you do what he suggest during the first week of class. Do the Assignments, come to class, and sit close to the front. If you pay attention and do the work you will do fine in the class. The test can be tough but thats only if you dont come to class and study before hand.",1
Mr. Randolph was extremely knowledgeable and helped us understand the content. He's reasonable but doesn't like you to not pay attention or be on your phones-typical professor. You'll enjoy his class.,1
"This is a one credit class on careers in environmental biology. It is really easy and you get to learn a lot about resumes and cover letters. Professor Hansen is a great teacher and helped me a lot with networking to find jobs. Overall, its an easy class with a lot of benefits.",1
"This class was definitely enjoyable. Lectures end up being pretty pointless because lecture exams are based off the practice test that he provides the answers for. Labs are fairly easy, but you must attend all of them if you want to pass the lab exams. No homework ever. The presentation is easy and easily graded. Overall great professor. ",1
"The class itself was very easy, I ran into some issues with the SAM site and when I asked for feedback it never came.  Overall the class was good but I had absolutely no interaction with the professor on her end. ",0
"He is a solid professor, it's just the material is boring.",1
"She was an okay prof, in terms of teaching I would never take her again. She reads of the powerpoint without properly explaining and a lot of times her review slides DO NOT MATCH HER EXAMS! she teaches something else and gives us review on something else. There are quizzes to boost your mark but doesn't really do anything.",0
run away. take a different history class.,0
"Such a hard time explaining what he was doing and solving. Students usually correct a small mistake it does. You literally have to practice more hours than the syllabus tells you too. He show a little sympathy for my class and gave notebook extra credit to which I thank god for, but I wouldnt recommend this class if youre not that good in math.",0
"Not the best, but certainly not the worst. You have a certain amount of absences until it affects your grade. Few homework assignments and exams. Use Google, read the textbook and keep your notes organized, you'll pass. Not much interaction besides daily exercise sheets with nearby classmates. No group projects/papers/presentations. EC offered.",1
"Amazing Teacher. You will create things that you didn't realize you were capable of if you let yourself be pushed. Taking design from Dwayne Bohuslav is a must for a great portfolio. And yes, you must love architecture to love him so either suck it up or find a new major.",1
"Throughout the year she never input any grades and when reaching out, she would not respond to emails. Eventually towards the end of the year, she announced that her computer was the issue and that it somehow inhibited her ability to release grades. There's a quiz every class but the catch is she only collects 6 so if you miss class u may be SOL",0
"Deeply difficult to understand which makes the material hard to understand. If you are a Russian native you will have no trouble, but for Memphis Tennessee its impossible to understand her.",0
:(,0
"Tests are very straight forward, almost identical to the practice exams he gives. ",1
"this must be her first semester teaching advanced convo, the class structure is not helpful and the presentations are the most terrifying assignments ever.don't be fooled! french convo may sound fun, but i have never felt more discouraged about learning french.",0
"Professor Landrum is an amazing professor. He teaches you how to truly view a film. However, be forewarned, you will read an entire book each and every week. You will be quized twice a week. You will also watch the novels adaptation every week. An 8-10 page essay along with a group adaptation is due right before your final. Do not fall behind.",1
BEWARE!!! He is a horrible online teacher. I DO NOT recommend taking him at all. He doesnt respond to emails whatsoever. I went to meet with him about my grades because projects that I turned in months ago still hadnt been graded. He didnt know that he hadnt make the final available to us until I met with him that day..,0
"Professor Pell speaks very quickly, it can be hard to catch her pace most of the time but if you do your revision after every class, you should be fine. Also, do your homework and attend classes, score the free marks it will help tremendously.",0
stay as far away from her! she dose not know how to teach!!!! when students ask questions she just says every one is right and dose not give a complete right answer.... she dose not know what she is talking about and she forgets everything she dose and says...dont take her class you will regret! she is not helpfull and she is soo baD!,0
Dr. Feige makes the topic very interesting! Approachable and helpful. Make an effort to learn and he will make an effort to help you out.,1
"Ryan is hilarious. He gives his very honest and blunt opinion on EVERYTHING. Homework assignments are easy As'. Go to lecture because he doesn't post them online. The tests are half lecture/ half book and pretty simple. He grades group projects harshly, but they are more about the concept than the presentation.",1
The best!!! I can't say more than that. ,1
Professor Neff is a genuinely great guy. He is so nice and cares so much about his students. He really believes in the material he teaches and is really enjoyable to just listen to. If you are taking Mosaics you can't do better than Professor Neff.,1
"Very respectable professor. Although can be seen as a strict and rude professor at times, he really wants to help you if you want to help yourself. Course contents are very beneficial for graduate studies if planning to do so.",1
"I went 15 weeks and didnt even know his name, let alone what he was talking about. discussions are pointless and vague. tests, book and discussions are all so different from one another. 1 paper, midterm, final. I have no idea what I was supposed to even get out of this course. Def wasn't what i thought it was going to be. movies SUCKED.",0
He was great but he seemed distant and I relied solely on the other teachers for help,1
"I took this prof. for a mini and all we did was work on his projects after class. Do not take this prof. for a mini, alot of after class work. We ended class on the dote than the whole class heads to the library to work on the projects until 10 or 11pm. Everyday for mini there is a new project to write. 5 to 7 pages.",0
"The material he teaches in class is almost no help when it comes to homework. Then when it comes to tests, reviewing homework, the study guide (which is a list of topics), and writing a sheet of notes seem almost useless, because the problems are not what you prepared for. The good thing is that tests are heavily curved as well as the final grade.",0
"Let me start by saying that this woman is ex-military and she shows it. She shows respect and cares for her students in person, but email is a different story. She constantly belittled the entire class over the last 15 weeks. It was very discouraging. Not clear on assignments until they were due the next day.",0
"Dr. Kalinowski encourages her class to perform well academically, but she's concerned with more than just grades. She cares about each of her students' ability to grasp, retain, and apply so that we can easily transition into a nursing career and be successful. Goes above and beyond for the students who reach out and makes a strong impact!",1
MY BOI SOKCHEAAAAA. LOVE THIS DUDE,1
Do not take professor Ricar. This is not about art at all it is a history class. She gives tons of assignments per week that are graded purely on word count. She cares more that you address her by name and respond to her thoughts than she does about you understanding or doing well in the course. not worth it. do not take.,0
She is amazing. She is very helpful. She goes over what is going to be on the exams to the T. I would definitely take her again if i had to.,1
"Patrick is honestly one of the best humans on the planet.  His class is really fun because instead of reading about boring literature he focuses on the perceptions of gender, race, class and sexuality in society.  He even makes you do a research project on a music video.  It doesn't get any cooler than that.",1
Professor Watson clearly understands teaching at a college level. I recommended her !! She persuade me to pick  the major I wanted to pursue the most!!! She's the person who's put her students education first. Just follow the Professor Watson way!,1
"Great professor!Practical experience as the top executive(CEO) in several large and small companies. He is intelligent, articulate,fun, very approachable and highly competent. I would recommend him to anyone with an interest in business.",1
"This Professor is super nice and transparent with what she requires. Put your best foot forward and you should be fine grade wise :) Do all the work in a timely manner (8 week classes are hasty & tedious, but well worth the time saved) and again, with your best effort, and you should get an A no problem :) She is very kind and easy to work with.",1
One of the best teachers in U of M. Her enthusiasm in teaching the material is contagious and has definitely sparked my interest in pursuing medical anthropology.  ,1
"Although this is the toughest class I've ever taken, MA really cares about her students. She shows it in an odd way because she can be rude or mean at times, but it's only because she wants you to do your best and want to succeed. Be prepared to do lots of homework problems. Read the book, and never get behind. It's impossible to catch up.",0
"She was an okay professor, but was really hard to talk to. Every message was a fight and I never felt I said the right things. Glad it is over for me",0
"He assigns weekly readings, which range from 20 to 200pgs, although you don't even have to read them, because he explains all of the important material during class. He provides a worksheet each class period, then uses those questions on the midterm & final. Several (4) papers throughout, including one group essay. Pray he likes your writing style",1
"yvette was so great!  definitely a favorite professor, and she was so good in lecture.  the paper assignments were really easy, and her TA for our class (javier) was very helpful with grading.  he was good looking, as well!  i would definitely take another class with her.",1
"I Took Abnormal Psych Advanced as an independent study for my Bachelors's. Just a suggestion when you get her book start reading the book and begin answering the questions through the chapters; they are either in red or blue boxes depends on edition. Not consistent giving feedback on the papers, made it clear to me she is VERY PART TIME.",0
"Fun personality. Decent teacher. He's not very good when it comes to actually teaching material on PowerPoint. When students would mess up it seemed like he judged them. Everyone makes mistakes and isn't perfect so he can't expect students to be experts right away, especially with his lousy teaching.",0
Taking this class during covid 19 pandemic. His setup is a camera pointed at the whiteboard. It is constantly unfocused and he stands in front of his writing making it very hard to take notes. I contacted the engineering department to help set him up with a digital whiteboard and was told he had one and didn't want to use it.,0
"As a student currently enrolled in this class, I truly wish I wasn't. This might actually be the worst class I've ever taken. There is an exam every week which, there are three versions for due to how hard they are and you will inevitably fail the first one. Stanton is unclear and does not help you at all when it comes to lectures. Do Not Bother.",0
She is awesome,1
"Calculus 1 is by itself difficult and although Prof. Le knows his stuff, the material cannot possibly be conveyed properly if most of the time the student is trying to understand the verbal component of the material being taught. So, if you're not innately good at math, his accent will definitely make it harder for you to learn.",1
"So this class was online no meet. Prof. Bratcher made it really clear with the assignments we had to do, which were all based on the reading for that week (for a history class, I expected a lot more reading). The only way to not do well in this class is to not read because all the answers are right there. It's also really to catch up when behind!",1
"Dr. Spiczak is genuinely such a smart man. That being said, he struggles interpreting the information to students in a clear and orderly manner. One - on - one he is much easier to understand, so I'd make sure to check his office hours. He's a very generous grader, the curves on his tests and overall class is favorable. ",0
"Terrible terrible teacher!! Very disappointed with her teaching methods, tests are hard and confusing I can't believe I ended up with a D I wouldn't take her again!!",0
"I literally slept through his class. He joked about people sleeping and actually said ""this class must be great because you come in, sleep, leave and get an A""...exactly what I did.",1
"She makes it so difficult. Deducts 1/2 a point off test for each Spelling Errors! The PP are on Black B, 30% of it! she gets upset when you ask her a question or to go back! she doesn't allow cameras to take pics of PP. A  good voice recorder is a most! If you fail a test, its impossible to catch up! I DO NOT RECOMMEND HER!",0
"I'd heard such great things about Dr. Anitori and was sorely disappointed by his teaching. He puts the most random information on his weekly exams, which are only 20 questions. You are not allowed to study from previous tests for your cumulative final, you can't question him or else he humiliates you, and there is a lack of organization in lab time",0
Quite boring..strong accent.semi-lenient with grading..unclear in lecture.he is nice though.,0
"This professor took long to get things graded and when you ask him about it he will blame it on his TA who you will never meet and does not even live in the same state. He will also not care about your grades. If he doesn't grade something right the first time, he never will. He will respond to emails but they are likely not helpful.",0
"Dr. Fein is a knowledgeable professor who really wants his students to learn. However, he has very high expectations, and he can be too demanding sometimes.",1
Okay let's begin. 1. She uploads the notes (if you're lucky... up to a week after they were covered in class) but without the pictures which she tests you on. 2. Not one soul on the planet can memorize every archaeological site in the world to put it on a map! 3. can't hear you! 4. memorize ALL of your notes for exams or you're screwed!!!!,0
The most difficult part of his course was learning APA format. I enjoyed the group work and chapter assignment. He encourages students to think critically and to get involved with community work. I think he is a great teacher.   He has a particular way of engaging students.,1
I have taken her for several classes. Great teacher and great person! She is full of personality and very passionate about her work. She loves to see her students excel and is always open to help! Take her she's great!,1
rude to students calls us stupid and lazy by saying all we do is play on our phones. tests are unbearably tough and half the things on the test he never talks about in class. Whenever u ask questions he rolls his eyes won answer them because apparently he told you about it before. I could go on and on about him! If you see him as your teacher RUN!!,0
"I nearly Fels this course. If it wasn't for Professor Fels' awesome lecture and in class participation, I would be clueless on how to do the course capstone project. She is the best teacher I've had and I would definitely take her again any day over any other prof teaching ITM700. (I hope you don't fels for this review)",1
"Absolute genius, passion for subject matter, cares about the individual student",1
"He is the worst professor I have ever had.  He is not helpful, I learn absolutely nothing in that class, and I just highly suggest not taking his class.",0
"Mrs. Langill is the WORST teacher ever. She is completely unorganized, she will tell you to study one thing and then test you on another, she doesn't provide any help to you, you either get it or you don't.The material is hard enough, and she is completely useless as a teacher",0
"Worst class I have taken at TCU. I almost reported her for being unbelievably biased when giving lectures. She is uninterested in hearing opinions other than hers, and her quizzes and exams are not easy by any means. Lots of reading and effort for a class I hated, and didn't even lead to a good grade. Would stay away 100%.",0
"Teacher is very nice,but is very confusing, goes beyond what is required which makes it confusing, grades random problems and i have never done so poorly in a class until this class. Went to the tutor center many times to get help. I would not reccomend this class unless you are very good at math and need little help or you want to retake it.",0
"I loved the Course, especially with George. He is very specific in his requirements for the course. You should attend classes because he goes over important stuff too. He is genuinely caring if you talk to him.",1
"Great professor, very knowledgeable and complehensible. His teachings are very helpful. I enjoyed his class a lot.",1
"There's a quiz every week in this class. One midterm and one final. Two papers. Participation definitely matters and book is mandatory or he'll deduct points. He'll count every time you participate in class. His lectures are very long and tedious. Personally never paid attention, but you can tell he cares about his students. He'll help if you ask.",1
Don't take her.,0
"Currently wrapping up her class, and it is great. She is very helpful, very insightful, laid back. She creates a chill atmosphere and yet, teaches in a way that sticks with you. She's also sexy",1
"Welcome to ""Clueless part II""  If you read and do nuthin else = B (SO boring)",0
"does not even sounds like he's interested in the subject. always speaks in a monotone voice. seems to put more emphasis on putting a quiz at the end and sometimes beginning of a lecture than actually teaching well. bad handwriting. the one comment praising him is out of their mind. i've never had a more unengaging, boring prof imo.",0
"She is nice as a person, horrific as a Prof. Dont expect to get an A if you only plan on attending lectures, you will have to go above and beyond to decipher her work. For the love of god find another Econ 2201 Prof or avoid it at all costs. I dont even know why I took this class, I thought it would be interesting.",0
"I took him for group comm and if you aren't working on the group projects in class he is lecturing reading STRAIGHT from a powerpoint presentation. WE AS STUDENTS CAN READ TOO. I felt like I was back in kindergarten... Easy class with some homework, but boring!!! Most of the class (lectures) other than group work is common sense... A drag, beware.",0
"Took his night class.... bad idea. All he does is talk and talk, and rants about other random stuff. Don't get me wrong he is funny, but that doesn't make up for other stuff. He literally has to walk up to you in order to hear what you said. STAY AWAY lol",0
"Had her as a chem recitation professor at Rutgers, & she was OK; But our professor had an emergency and couldnt lecture the class one day, so she did it. She teaches the lecture using powerpoint slides and goes so fast. Its rly hard to follow along with her! Shes kind of rude too. She makes thing unnecessarily hard and I really hated how she taught",0
"I took his class for fun, and while he is a great person and is really helpful his class has me doing hours of reading and lecture notes outside of class. To add on to it he is an incredibly hard grader. Do not take his class unless it is imperative. You wont regret what you learn but youll want to die.",1
"Thoseis a tough class as she expect you to have perfect knowledge from 1101. Shes nice, but I wouldnt recommend you take this class unless you learn at a fast pace. Bad semester",0
She was a very good teacher and made Accounting easy for me to understand.  She is very helpful and I have heard from numerous students that she is the best Accounting teacher that Westfield has.,1
"Mary, while clearly a kind and smart person, assembles her courses from a collection of half-baked ideas for projects. If you want a rigorous geology class where you learn more than you could from reading a few Wikipedia pages, Mary is not for you.",0
"This was barely creative writing, and it's not worth the money. There was no semblance of organization. Grosholtz's lectures were more about herself than learning actual content. There are no rubrics, canvas, and the syllabus/readings are never consistent. I have written more long, pointless essays than actual creative pieces. Don't even bother.",0
"Lecture class. I couldn't bare it and by the time the semester was over, I was ready to pull my hair out. One of those classes where you either have to study hours upon hours or walk into class not studying at all in order to ace the tests. Extra credit paper bumped me up an entire letter grade. Sweet guy as a whole, just an extremely boring class.",0
"Hardest teacher Ive ever had in my whole entire life. Ive always been an A student and got my first C in her class. Very tough grader, one little mistake and you will get a low grade. Does not explain anything and if you have a question she just tells you to read your book. Very strict teacher, and most of the time she does not make sense.",0
Music Theory: he's great. Will clearly explain things & make sure you understand. We do lot's of practice before the test. Aural Skills: sooooo slow. He will NOT challenge you. Take him if you struggle with aural. Do not take him if you're good and wanna be pushed because you will fall behind. He's a lovely person though.,1
"The content is interesting but gets spoiled by the teaching. All the material assigned as reading is recovered in class in long-drawn-out ways. The rhetorical style is boring, causing most students to get sleepy until being cold-called in the middle of a class to answer a specific question. If you do a lot of work you'll do well, but it's a pain",0
"Very confusing. You only use the notes you take in class for about 4 different extremely difficult tests throughout the semester. They will do you no good on the weekly online quizzes. I thought he was okay as a person and he seems to know his stuff, but hes not a good professor.",0
"Dr. Chiu is amazing. Accounting is definitely not an easy class, but she explains it very well. Honestly, she could probably teach accounting to a rock. Have a problem, she has flexible office hours and does in class exercises to make sure that you know exactly what you are doing. Lecture heavy, but that's the best way to do this class.",1
I made an account just to comment on what a terrible online teacher Derek Maher is. I wish I could've read this before taking the class online. It is not an easy online class. He does not work well with computers and is hard to keep up with his mishaps. He is terrible at responding to emails which is crazy because its online! Tests are hard. ,0
"Dr. Keefer goes above and beyond to create a fun and intellectual learning environment. She gives engaging lectures and you can really tell how passionate she is with her work. She truly is an inspiration. If you deserve a good grade, she'll give it much to the chagrin of the department heads. One of the nicest profs out there!",1
"Dr. S is one of the best in the business. I changed my major to Sociology after taking her class and most of my electives were from this field. She is very fair. She is not easy, but she is not hard either. She just challenges you to do your very best. TAKE HER, you wont regret it.",1
"As lovable as he is effective, Morales teaches Japanese from its foundations and has the experience to answer just about any question you could have. Classes are densely packed with information and timed perfectly, and homework is picked down to the individual question to help solidify learning. I eagerly look forward to JPN 2.",1
"Professor Hanson is a somewhat boring teacher in terms of note taking. He does have an intellectual sense of humor that rarely reaches the students. He is helpful with all his assignments and provides as much insight as possible for you to achieve the highest grade possible. Good teacher, but tough workload.",1
"Très long et plate, en plus de ça il n'est pas claire!",0
KNW is by far one of the most difficult and time consuming classes at SMU. But if you do the class right and met frequently and work diligently your team will succeed. Fontenot was strict and loose at times so get on his good side.,1
"Horrendous is the only way to describe this class and professor. Constantly unprepared, has no idea when her own due dates are, and halfway through this online summer class and the first assignment has yet to be graded. Mountains of busy work between team (group) assignments, individual assignments, for a short summer class. Ridiculous.",0
"Very old school style professor. Super knowledgeable and helpful when you approach him, but expect a lot of work to be done.",1
"She's very unclear, her lectures are beyond boring, helpful I'm sure but also at times I'm questioning relevancy. The entire class is one long group project which she can be very unclear about, she lets you know when things are due the day before and then when no one turns it she questions why. Pretty easy and fast grader,that is the only plus side",0
Prof Partovi is a very knowledgeable lecturer and can be surprisingly witty. Can come off as intimidating but really cares about your learning and success. Good use of media in lectures. Be warned: he has terrible handwriting! Heavy reading but not impossible. Participation in class is required. Was patient and accommodating during Covid-19 crisis.,1
"She is a good professor. Her teaching is pretty straightforward however, since I had to take her online instead of in person, it was pretty clear she struggled to give out her lectures ( a bit disorganized). I will give her credit for trying though. She is also nice and understanding with homework deadlines.",1
He is my favorite forever!,1
"Get ready to write down lots and lots and lots of lecture notes, he doesn't make them available online, honestly never seen a teacher do this before, and then he tells us if you don't study the lecture notes you're not gonna pass, also made us buy the book for $80 in the beginning of the year, never used it once",0
She talks a lot.,1
This is by far the worst teacher I had ever had at sac not very helpful posts the reviews the night before. Writes too fast on the board and also makes mistakes on the board too. Also all of his tests are extremely challenging.,0
"Just horrible. Confusing, goes off on rants, awkward. I wouldn't recommend this professor to anyone. I can't believe there's such a horrible professor at USI.",0
Mr. Drumond is a great professor. He is caring and well prepared when it comes to delivering lectures. I took Spanish 1 with him and loved his class. He makes sure to explain material and engages the class often. He loves when people participate. Do the homework and follow through with class lectures and you'll pass easily.,1
"Worst professor ever. I've struggled with math my whole life and she didn't make things any easier. Students were always correcting her work, she rushes through her lectures. There's 4 homework quizzes worth 8 points and 4 tests worth 100 points, no extra credit and she does assign a few random worksheets only worth 1-2 points. Wack grading system.",0
"She spends the entire class talking about herself and doesn't actually teach the material, yet when it comes time for the tests she expects you to know anything. Avoid this teacher at all costs!",0
Hart was the worst prof I've ever had.  The only thing I learned in this class was that she thinks protists are cute and that she loved fungi.  No use attending class because you learn nothing.  Teach yourself the material using the textbook because that is your only hope.,0
"I LOVE Chrissy. She is the most wonderful human and lecturer. She makes her class incredibly inclusive and provides such quality and informative information. She understands that some of us can't afford a textbook, so she doesn't require it. All of the exams are online- so you can use your notes. Truly, she is the best professor at SDSU.",1
"The worst professor I ever had. I was excited most about this class, but it teaches NOTHING about being a realistic teacher. She gives MULTIPLE large assignments, discussions, and weekly assignments. This is not a class to take if youre full time student. She also isnt approachable.",0
"I decided to drop her class after the first half of the first semester. Her class may be ""easy,"" but she is such a boring teacher-she reads straight from her notes. She gets WAY off topic WAY too much. It was rather dull at times, and I don't recommend this class for anyone unless you absolutely LOVE history.",0
If your not familiar with sign don't take this class it might not be for you. She is a very kind lady but she goes at a very fast-paced. she is deaf so if you don't know sign it makes it really hard to communicate if your not understanding,0
He is ok but make sure you do your homework to a T he will drop your final letter grade down if you do not meet his standards,0
"Sinha is not a well-organized professor and does not express care for her students. Not helpful during office hours at all and makes you feel dumb when asking questions:( study guides do not match test at all so don't base studying off of it. Work with TAs to learn the plant material. Try to avoid taking her, wasted studying time on class.",0
"I'll be honest, the physics series is rough, but Tolich made it better. He knows what he's talking about and wants us to learn. The exams are tough but he posts several practice ones and draws from them sometimes. If Tolich is an option, take him (I took him for 122, 123)! I would 10/10 recommend. He's known to be the best prof for the intro series",1
"Maybe he's better in person, but his online course is awful. There are no lecture videos, no outside materials, nothing other than the textbook and a supplemental packet that contradicts the book, you're just teaching yourself. Leaves constant condescending remarks on turned in work. YouTube is better, take this with a different teacher!",0
"It was an online class, so I'll give her the benefit of the doubt. She curved the final by 10 points, but when it's worth 50% of the class, that doesn't do much. You can find a better, more caring professor willing to work with you",0
"One of the best professors I've ever had, I hate history classes but she actually made me interested and kept me awake. What makes her such an amazing professor is you can just tell how intelligent and passionate she is about what she's teaching. Highly highly highly recommend her!!!",1
Excellent teacher and head of the deparment.  Get this guy.,1
"The best professor I have gotten all year. She is a little heavy in homework, but nothing that will take more than an hour or two to Oral quizzes is a big thing for her which is not too difficult and you can use your notes! These actually make you pay attention to the course material and this helped me learn a lot.",1
"Kelm is a great guy, talks extremely fast and loves to speak to students in spanish. All homework is online so be prepared to do alot of it. Tests are easy. Great at making spanish easy",1
Professor Bratcher conducts zoom meetings for any student that has questions about the course. He also gives an opportunity for his students to earn extra credit.,0
He over-complicates things in his lectures and is not great at explaining. He is mean when you don't understand something and want to ask a question. He takes away points in exams and lab reports for the smallest details.,0
3 things: Physio- study a day before test. anatomy study- 2/3 days before. Physio-use powerpoints/ and chp. summaries. make sure to understand everything on study guide. Easy class idk y ppl dont do well.,1
She is very caring and always willing to help you out if you need help. Her lectures are also very interesting and engaging. I would highly recommend!!,1
"Dr. Keralis seemed like a nice guy, though he grades really harshly. It's online so you can't hear how he is writing something, so I tried not to take his comments personally. You have to be on top of your work in his class because he doesn't post assignments until the week before they are due. The work load can be intense at times. Don't take..",1
Ms. Bekka Trapp Is my English 101 professor at MCCC and I do enjoy going to hear classes even though I feel like I am not a good paper writer she is gives us a chance to revise a bad paper to get a better grade. Her class load feels like a lot less than when I took English 101 and withdrew from it.,1
Not a very good class if you actually want to learn something.  I took her for speech and I know nothing more then I did before...,0
"Dr. Rombo has a bad rep but her classes are fun and manageable if you put effort in. The projects are based on your personal experience and family history. The exams reflect the textbook, so be sure read them. Go to office hours if you have any questions about the projects. Make sure you understand what she is clearly asking for before submitting!",1
Nice guy but horrible class. His grading system is ridiculous! Lectures are a bore. Would not recommend..,0
"worst teacher ever.. dont take her.. you'll regret it.. she's mean, bitter and wont ever help you..",0
"This was the worst prof I ever had. Don't bother taking her. She is so rude, very un understanding and extremely tough grader. You have to do everything exactly the way she wants it or you will fail. Her lectures are also extremely boring . Also make sure you're never late because she will take points off.",0
Best English professor. She helps you when you need help. Gives you feedback on what to improve and believes in you! The lessons and essays were easy. I enjoyed the class a lot.,1
I took her class online and she would not help. I advise you to NOT take this class online unless you really know accounting.,0
:-(,0
she's the worst teacher in NJCU. the only time she teach the class was when Dr. Barugel went to observe the class I was tired of her stupid video clip she show on the class. she's a frustrated producer,0
"easy money for him with no effort since he doesnt teach. Each week he post a few brief videos made in 2018 showing him working on problems, with no context. we have to post in the forum if we dont get it, only to just get answers from him or student with no explanation. just the answer... u learn nothing. lots of test not enough time to finish",0
Very insightful and has a nice way of telling you when your creative writing kinda' sucks.  haha. She points you in the right direction. Definitely recommend.,1
He is a nice guy but at first he doesn't come off that way. He wants you to work hard as if it was your major. You will have to teach yourself throughout the whole course. This course is hard and you may need a tutor. If you take this class make sure you read ahead and request the power points from him via email and GOOD LUCK,0
"Read the book, do the online anatomy revealed homework, and come to class. Study for the test, and you will make an A. Mrs. Langille is very passionate about biology, and that makes this class worth taking. There are no trick questions only straight forward you know it or you dont.",1
"This is a horrible class. Sue will spend the entire class talking, but nothing that is important for the test. Her power points didn't help either. They are crazy tough graders. It's almost impossible to get anything higher than a C on the essay exams. I would not recommend taking this class.",0
"BEST. PROFESSOR. EVER. Taking one of Constan's lectures was the best decision I've made in my collegiate career. He is brilliant, hilarious, and wholeheartedly cares for his students and material. I loved every class because he made the material something you genuinely enjoy. Highly recommend.",1
"Pretty useless professor. Mumbles in some unintelligible language which slightly resembles english throughout his lectures. His exams cover material which he doesn't go over in any detail until afterwards. grades the exams based solely on the answer and maybe a little work, so even the smallest error can bring you down to a c/d.  Not reccomended",0
"This was my first semester at OSU, and I'm extremely confident that this will be the best professor I will ever have. He is very caring and wants his students to succeed. He has weekend review sessions before midterms, and review sessions before quizzes. You won't be left hanging if you put in effort. He's a GREAT professor and an amazing person!",1
Just a terrible influence on anyone actually serious about writing. Does not help with writing at all. one text goes on for weeks and she will mark you down if your vision and her's are different. Tip: if she makes a note on your draft do it exactly for a good grade. her exams are pointless. Avoid taking her unless you can take class high.,0
"He's a nice prof but goodness is his class BORING. I took it during summer semester and I swear it dragged so slowly it was almost painful going to his class every day. That said the work is simple, he gives tons of extra credit at 5pts/piece, and his tests are very easy so long as you pay attention hard as it may be. No textbook needed to buy.",1
I took an online class with this professor. He would rarely answer my emails and I never knew what my grade was in his class. The tests online are 25 questions for a time of 25 minutes. This is very unrealistic to me. Not impressed with this professor at all.,0
Not an easy A but truly learned a lot. Tests were straight from his lectures. Lectures were great and made a 4 hour class durable. I would recommend this professor. Take good notes and study them for the exams and you should be fine!,1
"Excellent professor (2 classes with her). Very engaging, knowledgable, and fun.  Do the readings, attend class, and do the extra credit. Got an A easy.",1
"Her lectures are long, dry, and boring. She is knowledgeable, however; she lacks structure and clarity in both the lectures and exams.  In her Japanese history class, the exams are heavily influenced on Japanese names and terms versus historical events. 60-200 pages assigned to read per week. very tough grader. Waste of time and tuition. ",0
"Professor Stacy (no e in her name) Hansen is knowledgeable and experienced. She often intimidates her students and leaves them feeling stupid if they ask questions. She is quite moody and will tell you that herself. Her final exams have been incomprehensible. I like her as a person, but would not take another class with her again.",0
Ridiculous test questions.  I have my masters and I took this as part of a 2nd certification.  Hardest/ most obscure test questions ever.,1
"Great professor, would definitely take a class with her again!",1
If you can avoid him please do. He takes forever to grade work and his feedback is not very meaningful or insightful . He does not respond to emails in a timely fashion and if you are lucky to get a response its a condescending one.,0
"Great at getting me to think differently. Though the projects were hard, and most time very open ended, the ideas were pretty interesting and my work got so much better.",1
"While this class was difficult, you WILL be quite prepared to teach in an urban setting. Professor Manski is an excellent gauge on a student's readiness to go inside an actual classroom. Although there is room for growth and I have my entire teaching career ahead of me, I am much more confident in my ability to be successful in the classroom.",1
His teaching method uses the material from the text but he goes beyond and incorporates real world experience into his lectures.,1
winter2021. The class was unorganized and schedule was messy and hard to read. Barely taught while giving a bunch of hw everyday. heavy accent. not tech savvy. felt as if the class wasn't prepared in advanced. spent half the class trying to reschedule the test and quizzes.,0
I find that staring at paint drying is more interesting than Professor Hulsey's class. She gives nothing but dry lectures and hardly engages the class with anything useful. Most of what I learned came from using McGraw Hill Connect which will be essential if lectures aren't your thing. Content is tough to be fair but tests were online and fair,0
If there is any other professor for you to take. TAKE THE OTHER OPTION! Biochemistry is an complex subject that requires a lot of explanation and he doesn't go a good job at explaining. His lectures are boring and it's like he's just talking to himself. He puts material on the test that don't match his teaching. I had to teach myself everything.,0
"LOVE THIS GUY! Took two classes with him and ahhh, he's just the best! This was like a life class. Honestly, everything I learned in his class has helped me and will continue to help me not just academically but for every day life. RECOMMEND! I would just sit in on his class if I could haha. He's awesome! TAKE HIM!",1
"She is useless in the classroom, doesn't explain things very well, and talks about things that are completely irrelevant. Too much class time is devoted to doing what should be homework. The textbook the department uses is horrible; I had to go online to find out what I needed to know. However, I found her quizzes and marking to be very easy.",0
"To this day, she is one of my favorite teachers!",1
"I loved professor Lhota! She is so kind and helpful and is with you every step of the way. All you have to do to get an amazing grade in the class is to show up, do the work which is very easy. We had 3 essays all semester. The 3 essays are supposed t be 4 pages long but she believes in quality over quality. Overall an amazing Professor!",1
"I'm honestly very surprised that there aren't more comments about Mr. Alcala. Not only is he a very supportive counselor but he has class too. If you need more credits take his class, it will definitely motivate you to be a better student and launch towards your career. He's practical and fun, I promise it'll benefit you having him in your corner.",1
"I took Biology 101. I only lasted four weeks with this professor. There were multiple labs, quizzes, chapter reviews, and discussion boards due every week. My ""study guide"" for my first exam was a 48 page text book summary of the first unit (five chapters/100+ pages). The study guide was way too complex. I took the exam and felt very let down.",0
Great teacher. She personally called me to make sure that I knew what I was supposed to be doing.,1
prof. goldner is very unorganized during lectures. good luck taking notes because he jumps around from topic to topic without making anything cohesive. his study guides are useless as nothing listed on them correlate to the exams. he's very rude and patronizing to his students and his classroom etiquette is ridiculous. history majors avoid him.,0
"One of the best professors Ive ever had. She is very straight forward with her assignments & she is not a tough grader. She offers a lot of extra credit and there is minimal assignments. If you fail this class, its because youre lazy. Her lectures and entertaining and to the point.",1
"Took his online class, a lot of work get ready to work and be committed to this class. A lot of reading, discussions and quizzes. He is a tough grader and I highly recommend you do not take him. The online class was very heavy and sometimes mis leading.",0
"Great teacher. If you're taking microbiology, take it with Staples. You'll learn a lot which will lay a good foundation for all other science classes that you take (& your career). He has a great talent for getting students to use all parts of their brain during learning, e.g. discussion, drawing, application during lab, study review sessions.",1
"Dr. J is quite frankly the best professor I have ever come in to contact with. She guides you, as you are typically a freshman in her class, through your experiences as a freshman english education major. You will be grateful for the high demands she has for you after you complete her class and have a grip on your life as a whole. TAKE HER CLASS! ",1
I re-took Thermo with Rolle and I think I learned more from him than my previous professor. He focuses more on the theory compared to doing problems. He has lots of experience and can give an example for nearly every topic in the class. Home problems are hard but tests aren't too bad if you stay on top of things. Take him.,1
Although she is not a mechanical engineering graduate she is a great statics instructor. She has some of the best lectures and really cares about all of her students. Test are pretty easy compared to homework and if you pay attention in class you shouldn't need to study a ton. Favorite instructor at Mines thus far.,1
oral presentations homework every week attendance is mandatory if you skip a class takes points off,0
"Pire prof que j'ai eu a ce jour, aucune explications utile vous devrez vous preparer vous meme pour les examens a l'aide du livre",0
"-Great, entertaining lectures -very caring -professor brings scantrons for his class",1
Matthew has been one of my favorite professors by far. He is so nice and gives you ample opportunity to do well in his class. If anything ever comes up then you can just go talk to him about it and work something out. Very understanding and willing to work with you. You do talk about some heavy things in his class so be prepared for that.,1
"Absolutely loved Prof. Zimmers class! For life drawing, it was all studio time, lectures were brief, never exceeding 15-20 minutes, the rest of the time was for working. He is very kind and funny and will give you honest constructive feedback, one of the best professors I've ever had. My skills improved ten-fold taking this class with him.",1
Logic 1 - Really nice & funny guy but class was awful. He isn't very good at teaching but he tries his best to explain things to you BUT ALWAYS digresses. No quizzes. Exams have no study guides or sheets. The book is ancient and the language makes it impossible to understand. Not an easy class so unless it's ur major don't take it.,1
"La Profesora Fletcher, I can't say enough nice things about her. She has a great sense of humor and is an extremely talented teacher. She is also very helpful and cares a lot about her students. Spanish is easier for some and harder for others, but if you do your HW you will earn an A. Take her class!!",1
"He is too much. Doing the most and you think he would understand since he is so young but in reality he is not. He does not really help you even speak the language correctly, even if you participate he does not really help. He is a rule follower in the way that it is detrimental to your learning and advancement.",0
"Professor Eubanks is extremely knowledgeable in his field. This was one of the most interesting courses I've taken at NCTC. It requires a lot of reading and writing, but the majority of the material is highly fascinating. There is no textbook required as the professor provides all of the reading material, so you save some money there.",1
"He's actually not that bad, I think.  It's hard to tell whether he is mean, hateful and condescending or whether he's trying to be funny.  Whatever it is though he really needs to work on his personality.  He's a graduate student that isn't ready to be teaching yet.  I've had graduate students before who were amazing, he is not one of them.",0
very easy to co-operate with,1
"Daniel Baker is one of my favorite professors here at Delta, he is really caring and funny and cares a lot about this work. There are test and quizzes every week on the chapter that is being taught but they are not that hard. The reading is kinda heavy so be prepared. You have a test every 4 chapters so pay attention. Highly recommend him!",1
"Lecture were extremely boring and tough to pay attention to. The tests were online and pretty difficult. It's possible to get an A, and I would take this class again. But it's not a fun one to get through.",0
"The material is alright, Dr. Simerka is very helpful. Expect pop quizzes (12 but she drops 2), 3 ""freebies"" for absences, 2 papers, midterm and final. You can rewrite your paper to get a higher grade and she will help you to write it during her office hours.",1
"I took his online Evolution of Hip Hop class. He doesn't show you just how much is due each week, he releases the week's work all on one day exactly 7 days before they're due. One week he assigned 3 quizzes, an hour and a half long documentary with 3 required posts afterwards, and an 8 page research paper all due on the same day. This class is hard",0
Overall good professor. Class is well organized. Give homework in every class but easy to finish within class. Do work on time and show up. Strict with deadline. He will give you genuine feedback. Respect Dr. G,1
"Hybrid course, the days we met in class, we would only go over homework, homework was also difficult. Have to study weeks before test to pass. Try to avoid. Have to use book and program to pass.",0
"Good prof; very engaging and enthusiastic about topics and conversation regarding the course; can be a bit over-enthusiastic when this was a morning class, but overall easy to talk to and approachable. Would recommend for a research paper prof.",1
"Started this 8 wk class with her, ended up dropping to take with a different teacher in 16 wk format. She is a tough grader, both tests & quizzes are pretty difficult, but doable if you read. There is a TON of reading, but not many assignments. She's willing to help, but overall tough.  She's okay to take but go w/ someone else if possible.",0
"She doesn't use a textbook, so no need to worry about purchasing one. Will give you a link to read online. Also, make sure to stay on top of assignments, takes off 15 points off top if late work. A lot of graded class participation. When doing papers, at least turn something in, don't just give up or not show up. Communication is key with her.",1
"The lectures are boring and uninteresting. I've been playing music for years and even I can't get past how monotone he is in presenting the subject. He knows his stuff, but he doesn't bring it down to the level that most would be at in this class. The book is pointless as well, so you can save your money there. I don't recommend this class.",0
"I have taken many Honors English classes and I found this ""basic"" class to be very difficult. The directions for assignments were unclear and when Dr. Lewan would send an update regarding the assignment, the criteria changed. I thought her grading was very harsh.  She is certainly a stickler for the dynamics of writing and no creativity is allowed.",0
"She is a very kind person who wants her students to understand the language and do well in the class. She is kind of hard to understand at times because of her accent and she speaks in French for some instructions, but overall I liked her teaching style and would recommend taking her if you have some experience with French.",1
"if you want to get a 100 on everything you do, take him. I LOVE JOE CHEN! he is a cute old man, very nice guy, and impossible to fail. However. you won't learn a thing in his classes....",0
i never thought i could write before i took this class.  i got all A's and i had a great time in class.  ms. trapp would joke around with us but she taught us so much.  i would definitely take another class with her. i never had a teacher that cared so much.,1
"This is a difficult subject.  His teaching methods are unclear and the class is left confused.But he is relatively lenient on tests and quizes If you wish to gain experience predominately teaching yourself this subject through homework and the book, take his class. He does try very hard to answer any questions you have.",0
"I was nervous knowing class participation was a must and we had to sit in a circle but because it was mostly discussion it was so much more interesting then other courses I have taken. This class was too short so the papers and workload ended up creeping up quickly, but this class maintained my interest...I enjoyed it!",1
"Professor Drumond is an understanding and compassionate yet professional instructor. He's very thorough and organized in his lectures, and provides all the necessary resources to succeed in his class. I highly recommend this class. Five Stars to Professor Drumond!",1
"Started on campus, was very lecture heavy, speaking almost entirely in French from day one. Transitioned to an online course (Covid) and the lectures/teaching stopped for the most part. Zoom sessions were mainly review for what you learned on your own with VHL/HW. Offers little to no help outside of the classroom. Don't recommend.",0
If you want to be thoroughly confused and question your entire life I guess this is the class for you. So many assignments that arent worth much. Kinda feels like a waste of time. I would rather swallow a jean jacket than take this course again,0
One of the best teachers at Vandy. Going to his office hours helped tremendously and he is very willing to work with his students. He wants to see us do well and his passion for the subject makes me want to study Sociology as my major.,1
"very unorganized, and i hate group projects, and in this class everything is a group project",0
"Has an accent, but while it is easy to discern what words are coming out of his mouth, it is impossible to understand what he is talking about. He spends every lecture covering the board in equations and theorems that will never be used on any problems and does not explain what they do. After the first test the class becomes impossible do not take.",0
"Professor Krusko is an excellent teacher.  She is clear, helpful, and that makes the material very easy to understand. She is very learned in the Anthropology field, and it is no wonder that she is the department head.",1
"Almost impossible to understand, hardly ever returns homework, and you are tested before quizzes get returned. Knows his stuff, but he just can't get it to the students effectively. He WILL notice if you miss a class, and you WILL pay the price for it.",0
"Most of your grade is based on the group project you do. You do consulting work with a company to create training programs for humanitarian work. The other material includes case write-ups, quizzes, and reflections.",1
"You leave class everyday confused and learn absolutely nothing. You're expected to know what he left off after class. Relies HEAVILY on MyMathLab Homework assingments, which only boosts up your grade by one point. (Don't miss a day on them, it will drop your grade badly!!) Try not to fail any of the four tests, will bomb your grade.",0
It is the beginning of the term. He has answered almost all of the questions people ask respectfully. I had to be the one to complain against him to have him update his blackboard assignments. He ignored students asking for updates on projects due. Everything was based on last terms deadlines confusing you if you need to make your schedule.,1
"He brings examples to class, and uses videos to explain his point. I hardly went to class and read the book instead. He also has study guides online which are extremely helpful for the tests!",1
"I took him for a maymester class so everything was accelerated. There's a lot of writing about the films! The presentations are easy to follow through but it's hard to find films to watch on netflix/hulu (just google the movie honestly). However the peer review system is awful bc student opinion impacts your grade... aside from that, its ok.",0
"The worst professor that anyone could possibly have. Inconsiderate, rude, and not helpful in the slightest way. Study weeks before the test and God forbid you forget one sentence he says in class because the smallest detail could be on an exam. The listening examples are your best friend and the only thing you are for sure prepared for.",0
"I also searched her on RMP and was scared but she is so helpful. Really learn so much, easy, so many extra credits. PPl who don't wanna study or do an effort in exams, don't like her but who really want to study love her. She is one of my best teachers and I do not believe feedback on rate my professor. Love her..",1
"I took her in the summer and although she has way too many iClicker questions, she is actually a good professor- Her exams were difficult but I was lucky and got a really helpful TA but overall I would recommend her- She usually tries her best to make the class enjoyable but I will warn you the tests consist of too many questions in little time-",1
"I took this class online. I believe that Professor Killough would be a good professor in a different area, but not in Into to teaching (edu 200). She runs blackboard in the most unprofessional way that I have ever seen and when I told her I didn't understand it she laughed sarcastically. She gave me 2 0's for no reason and I had to correct her. ",0
"Took her online Humanities 1A class. It had a lot of writing on the discussion pages and reading in the textbook. The exams were times essays on a question about some theme you were learning. She did not grade hard though, not like an English teacher. She just wanted to read your ideas. Lots of busy work, but its not too bad.",1
"She's a very sweet woman to talk to as a friend but not as a teacher. In the beginning of class we would just talk, then go through the presentation, and then somehow land up talking about her life again. If you want to pass, you have to take a lot of notes, but honestly, its hard when her talking makes you want to curl up and go to sleep.",0
"Dr Hart is so smart at cellular biology, but she is the worst at teaching to students. She is very scatter-brained, talks very fast. The labs for this class took a lot of outside class time, including going in on weekends.",1
I definitely do NOT reccomend this professor. his quizzes had nothing to do with the material learned in class and his loud teaching style makes it hard to comprehend,0
"Took her online class and had to drop it. She is a tough grader, work is worth two points, wants everything done correctly, very rude, expects a lot in discussion posts, is not clear in what she wants, work is due by 5, no late work, extra credit is impossible to do, and depends on the book for everything with no help if asked for some. DONT TAKE!!",0
"Professor Johnson is a very passionate researcher and a very kind person. You can tell that she sincerely wants her students to succeed. However, she is very specific in her tests and can sometimes ask questions to which answers are only found in lecture. Grading is tough and you really have to study hard and embrace small details in this course.",1
"takes attendance daily, you have two papers to write each week from the book but very easy, lots of extra credit opportunity. basically show up to class, do a few papers, easy A",1
"This guy's class ia a joke!  I would not call him a teacher, but rather a mere facilitator.  There is no input from him or any of the other professors that ""teach"" this class.  The class is pretty much run on auto-pilot with virtually no involvement from the ""professors"".  Useless busy work - This is from someone that got an A!",0
"He's definitely a tough grader and does not specify at all if you mess up, you can be doing good and all of a sudden he starts giving poor grades and his feedback is nothing but initials of a chart he has. I wouldn't take his class due to the lack of professionalism and compassion as a Social Work professor.",0
"Dr. Everhart is amazing! He helping me lout a lot and was always willing to do his best to make sure we had the best experience. Tests are a breeze if you pay attention and study! If I was not graduating, I would take a class with him again.n",1
"I took this class online and it was fairly easY 2 quizzes, midterm, 2 more quizzes, final, term paper. Take him if you can!",1
"Dr. Hur has to be the worst instructor I've ever had. He was confusing, couldn't speak clearly and his tests were impossible to understand. The average grade was a D and the only good thing was his ""Plan B"" that curved the grades. Do yourself a favor and DON'T take him. He can't teach and it's really a disgrace he's a professor at ASU",0
"He is a nice person but not so good at lecturing. He is a really strict grader, who has really high expectation to his students. I don't think I will take his course again, because there are so many mandatory small projects. This course is very labor intensive.",0
"Taking an online class with Jennie was a bit difficult. She only held office hours one day a week for 2 hours. Although, if you asked for help she would give it to you. She understands that life happens and is easy to work with. She does make you write a lot for tests and homework, but in the end it helps you understand it better than before.",1
I actually really liked this professor. PAY ATTENTION TO ONLINE HOMEWORK AND SLIDES FROM LECTURE WHEN STUDYING FOR TESTS!,1
"He seemed great at first, the pacing around was manageable. Then he started missing class, sometimes he would let us know and sometimes he didn't. Missing class was very frustrating especially when I have a million other things going on. He rambles too much and writes so much that I would get lost in his words. If you take his class, good luck.",0
"His questions in class lingered on and on. Unimportant topics that he had some hidden interest in were just driven. His tests were okay. In the essay portion he wants every single last detail. I drew a chart, and cited him word-for-word and still got a 4 out of 6 on one question.",1
"So overall I don't think she is a bad person. But it has been halfway through the semester and I have only had three grades entered and we submit multiple assignments a week. She also isn't exactly specific on what we are supposed to know, to the point of where I have gone up after class and asked about an upcoming exam and she said ""don't worry.""",0
"Dan Pierce is hands down the worst professor I have ever had. He is disrespectful, childish, and horrible at teaching. He does not cover any real material, he just sort of meanders over topics and wastes people's time. He is rude to students, says things to belittle his students, and acts untouchable. I wish I could give him a ZERO, he is AWFUL.",0
"First of all, she is a very sweet woman. Her heart is genuine, but her teaching skills are inadequate. Her spelling and grammar are both atrocious, on top of her very thick accent. A majority of the time, we have no clue what she is saying. When you can understand, it's usually her far-fetched opinion and if you don't agree with her, you're wrong.",0
"Where do I begin. How about the fact that we finished the curriculum BEFORE SPRING BREAK. We hadn't had exam 1 and he was already teaching exam 3 material. I use the term ""teachcing"" VERY loosely. He does not work out problems contrary to what he says. He puts a piece of paper on a project and reads the numbers for 15 seconds. A V O I D. ",0
"I was a bit let down by the teaching style of this professor. She presented math in powerpoint slides so it was very difficult to grasp the concept. We did not work through many examples in class, so I had trouble with doing the problems at home. Her tests are take home, but the problems are much harder than what she goes over in class.",0
"Great professor, really knows what he is talking about.",1
Not sympathetic to her student's needs or feedback. Her lecture slides are difficult to read and all look the same. She doesn't understand that this is a hard course & concepts are foreign to students and need to be explained in a way we can understand. Her final exam was ridiculous. Not a great prof :/,0
"Professor Miriam Keller-Perkins is a nice teacher, but she doesn't know how to teach. When I take her class, only 1 out of 7 is passing her class. She said she won't fail you if you fail all her tests or quizzes, she will give you a D ( a passing grade). If you want a better grade, I hope you don't take her class ever again.",0
"Terri is very nice, but she can't really teach. She just reads straight off the PowerPoint and doesn't elaborate on anything. It's pretty much up to you to learn the material on your own. Her tests and quizzes are all multiple choice, but she words her questions weirdly and asks things we don't really cover in class. Avoid if possible.",0
"Miranda is disorganized and showed up to the class late or right at start time. she enjoys rambling about unrelated things which also wastes time, tests are fairly easy if you go to class. she likes to ask questions about examples and side stories she mentions so pay attention to those! the only reason people went to class was for clicker quizzes",0
"Jeanette is one of the most vague professors imaginable. All questions are answered in an impossibly ambivalent manner. Grading is also very subjective. Overall, though, she knows what she is talking about and will better prepare you for the world of business.",0
"He has a routine of two days lecture and one day quiz but his lectures are actually not boring, there pretty funny sometimes. That is basically all the semester expect one essay but the essay is super easy because it's a biography essay.",1
THE GOOD COMMENTS ON THIS INSTRUCTOR IS FLASE. I SUGESST HE WROTE THEM HIMSELF.,0
"Carageorge only cares about her opinion, and is a super hard grader. Yes, critique is important, but when you pour your heart and soul into a film and are pretty much told that it is garbage, that's when you start to lose hope. That's what happened to me. Not giving up on film school yet but boy was I close with Carageorge. Don't take her.",0
"Takes attendance every class. Lectures tend to run upclose to the end. He's old school - no powerpoints, no use of iLearn whatsoever so you are unable to access any of the pictures or info that he shares. He speaks monotone. Seems grumpy all the time. Handwriting illegible.  I boughtused the Red CR.  Midterms: A-, B+ Overall Grade: B+",0
"Interesting topic and there's potential for the class to be cool but the lectures drag on and the professor isn't really captivating. As long as you show up and pay attention you should do fine, just be ready for reaaaaallly long lectures",0
He has long lectures about what he talks about. If you pay attention to the DVDs youll be fine. Not really much to do when just taking notes. Sometimes he asks certain foreign words and wants the class to participate in on their meaning. Most of the time its silent in class because we just doesnt know the answer.,1
"She's just like any other tough bio teacher. But she's nice and will grade you fairly.  But her exams are not easy.  I hate ssaying so, but there are no easy bio classes here.  You have to study her material everyday, otherwise you'll fall behind.  so far i'm half way through the semester and i have a D.. but shes still a pretty good teacher.",1
"Pros: - Flexible on the due date of homework if a life event pops up.  Cons: - No feedback on the graded homework so you have no idea where you went wrong. - Says he gives partial credit on the exams, but he doesn't. - Really hard to follow his lectures, so I spent hours outside of class watching Prof. Leonard to teach myself the subject material.",0
"This online class was my least favorite business class of all time.  The instructor assigns an obscene amount of homework for how basic the class is.  I was also not a fan of having ALL homework, assignments, quizzes, etc due on FRIDAY NIGHT.  Ouch!  Expect hours of busy work and an absolutely detestable TWO group projects that made no sense!",0
"He is a good teacher.  Gives good notes, and know them well.  He may pull test questions from the reading that he didn't talk about.  Fends questions well, so he knows his stuff.",1
"He had a good sense of humor which kept the class time moving quicker. He did complete reviews of his exams before the exam. What I did not like was that he races to finish his scheduled work and doesn't have time for your questions if you don't understand. He also rushed the ""final"" pig dissection and I would say his teaching is very disorganized.",1
"A very good professor whos the only one Id prefer to teach me math thusfar. His lectures are amazing because of they he makes the lesson relatable to his students. He also interacts with his students & if we have questions about any types of problems, we solve several of those types together as one. Hes the ideal math professor.",1
"I love Werbe!! She is my favorite french teacher and the reason I wanted to become a french minor. She is very smart and cares about her students. She also makes french engaging and fun. In addition, she doesn't assign a lot of busy work and makes sure every student is on the same page in lecture before moving on to another topic. I recommend her!",1
Class is too hard. Exam questions are undoable unless you have access to the questions ahead of time. The labs/assignments are irrelevant to what you actually need. Avoid if you can.,0
"This guy should not be teaching. Does nothing but bash our President & calls conservative media ""Faux"" news... He cares for no one else's opinion and demands his students to laugh at his incredibly insulting jokes. CBC should evaluate this guy. He should be teaching unbiased lectures/facts, instead I receive nothing but opinions and rants....",0
"Easiest A you'll ever get. He doesn't take attendance but you do have to participate 5 times throughout the course. If you have social anxiety like myself, just send him an email and you can email him for participation points. Homework, tests, and final are all online and you can just google all the answers. Super nice guy. Take him!",1
"This class was SOO boring, but it's easy. You don't need the textbook and your don't even have to go to class. I don't think I listened to any of his lectures, but I got an A in his class. He talks so quietly. The whole class is based on presentations and 2 online exams.",0
"Her PowerPoint are very visually based, lost of pictures, and it took about 10 minutes to download a PowerPoint onto my computer to study. Very annoying. Also she herself is very annoying.",1
One of the worst Armstrong has. Don't be fooled by his cool and helpful demeanor. Classic example of Armstrong cadre with a caring face and words but I don't give a ... attitude when it matters. Will actually cost you a letter grade by applying double standard when grading papers for a Leadership class. Not in sync with the class professor.,0
Saas was an awesome professor. He was very laid back and was really lenient. He really does care about his students. He wants everyone to pass. This class is an easy A. Literally just do what is asked of you and turn it in on time and you'll get an A. Not a hard class at all. He's also really funny.,1
Space shot!!! Never heard a professor talk about twearking before until now. Easy class. VERY easily sidetracked. Easy assignments.,0
"Coop is a great guy. He knows what he's talking about and wants you to succeed. However, he is not clear with where he is going in the lecture sometimes and he also does not do a lot of examples. If you do all of the homework it will help with your understanding, but just be prepared for having to teach yourself some things.",1
Most boring class I've taken at UT.  Seriously.,0
"SHE SUCKS! DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS! I studied for hours and still struggled because her exams are stupidly difficult and attendance is taken for EVERY lecture and discussion. I learned nothing, was stressed 99% of the time, and hated her 'teaching' style.",0
"Tough grader, way too much reading. rude, obnoxious and very opinionated . Only her opinion matters in class and she will let you know that right way. Take her courses if you want to be miserable.",0
"I LOVE HER SO MUCH!!!!! But remember: Pittman expects you to do your work. Pay attention. Write your essays. Study. It's not hard to get a great grade if you study - but if you don't care enough about your education to study this isn't the class for you. Pittman has a beautiful Minnesotan accent, is a lovely person to talk to, and very helpful.",1
"I literally learned nothing in this class. He only talks about himself and is very narcissistic! I got A's on every quiz,essay, and the final and yet he gave me a B! He makes up his own grade for you. If you're major involves social work or sociology do not take him because you will not be prepared for other classes. Easy but does not grade fairly and you learn nothing!",0
"Steve is one of the best math professors I've had (and I've had a lot). He gets the difference between teaching/testing a concept and making it unnecessarily rigorous. He also teaches the use of a variety of technology (WolframAlpha, Mathematica, Ti-XX calculators, etc.). He's a funny dude, gives good lectures, and isn't out to fail you.",1
"Howard is great, just pay attention to the syllabus.  Make sure you know what assignments are due when.  He lets you make up assignments if you miss class, but try your best to be there all the time.",1
"Words cannot describe how terrible this class was, take Mrs. Pickham if you want to have a chance at passing speech.  And if you do for some reason take this class, be ready to hate your life, dont come in 1 minute late, dont fidget while giving your speech and make sure to let her know i hate her guts, thanks.",0
"I had to take two classes with this teacher. The first semester all he gave us were two reading assignments with papers, providing little to help your grade if done poorly on them. Also his comments on papers are confusing and not helpful. With this teacher, be prepared to use sources such as smartthinking to help you and to work hard without help.",0
Easy going and very knowledgeable. He helps students anyway he can. I wish he taught more classes. Highly recommend.,1
"Professor Bowlin is the laziest teacher ive ever had. She hasnt taught us anything in class, she just has the students continually present powerpoints to do her job for her. In the other class i have with her, she just sits on the podium and reads from the book the whole class while she told us to buy it cause we ""need it"" I would avoid her",0
One of the best professors I've ever had. He actually cares about what you actually take from his class and learn and adapts the lectures to what everyone is struggling with (as opposed using 10 year old slideshows). As long as you complete the given assignments (he drops a certain amount) you'll succeed in this class.,1
"Keeps interest! The every day schedule is about 45 minute lecture and the rest is what ever video you're watching that day accompanied with a 5 question sheet about the video.    He truely knows AND CARES about his stuff, so he rarely uses the book. And listen because he repeats test material. PLENTY of extra credit and time to turn in your work.",1
Professor Green is probably one of the best professors to have. His lectures are engaging and inclusive. He actually cares about your thoughts and input. He grades by the content of your ideas and gives solid USEFUL feedback. Funny and relate-able too!,1
"She's just not a good professor. I'm sure she's a nice person and I feel bad that people disrespect her because they are mad that she grades harshly, but she does not do a good job at making the material accessible to us. We're literally undergrads and there's no reason why an intro class has to be overtly hard when the material is already dense.",0
"he's a really cool guy, but with type of subject matter, you'd think he could make it a little more interesting. even lab is a sleeper, though you'll regret it since class participation is 20% of grade!",0
way boring class he talks way too much and keeps you in class the whole entire time,1
"She is a good teacher. Provides good examples and explains stuff well. She just uses her slides all the time, if attendance was not mandatory you would still pass her class, since she likes to do quizs and test of her slides and practice questions. Do the practice questions will help you a lot on tests, since majority of examples comes from there",1
She's the reason I decided to drop my psych minor. prior to her class psych classes where the least stressful because professors were always too nice and had their students wellbeing in mind but this professor was so not understanding even in the middle of a pandemic. how did this class stress me out more than a calc 2 class.,0
"Everything is very clear and if you participate Dr. Lane is not rude to you. If you are lazy or don't want to think, he will challenge you.",1
"This was by far one of the worst teachers I've taken during my college career. She's unruly, rude, and makes you feel less than adequate if you don't understand the material. The labs were extremely hard to do online and not in person. Most of the time the material she said was ""going to be on the exams"" in fact weren't. Please take another teacher",0
She is very very hard and thrives on students failure. doesnt really care about the students...just how many fail. not very helpfull. Class is a joke test arent on material the on how well you take test,1
she does about a month's worth of lectures and then puts the rest on students. I pay her salary and she sits back and watches. 15 minute presentations from students for 3 hours numbs your mind; we are not professors so it can get quite boring. AVOID HER CLASS AT ALL COST,0
She is a great teacher.,1
Super easy! I've never taken such an easy class. Granted I feel like I didn't learn much. All quizzes and the final were on quizlet. The final is literally all the quiz questions so I recommend taking pictures of the answers to the quizzes and creating a database that you can reference for the final. DB and web assignments are easy too.,1
"What a happy dude, literally always has a smile on his face. This class isn't really a class. It's a workshop with some easy online work that can be done at your own pace. If you wanted to you could finish it all in a few weeks and never have to come to class again. Tests are also online and open book. Literally impossible not to pass.",1
"She's a very sweet woman, but she's not a great teacher. She doesn't explain things well and in math there needs to be a certain level of explanation for things to click. You can pass if you do your homework and make good grades on them, see her after class, if you didn't understand something, and see a tutor. I would have failed without a tutor",0
"Prof. Dillion is not for lazy, but if you want to hear a great story as opposed to reading a text all day I recommend her. Class moves fast, and is sometimes all over the place but will keep you alert with her infectious laugh and excitement for a subject. Great hands on experience.",0
"He seems to be a very nice man outside of the classroom, but once in class he is incredibly condescending. He does not listen to his students needs. His comments on papers often left students feeling embarrassed and upset. I went to office hours with him but left feeling worse about my paper. Honestly one of my worst experiences with a professor.",0
He is prepared and all lecture materials are up to date!,1
Really interesting class to take. You will learn a lot. He is very humurous and that makes the class more enjoyable,1
cool teacher. a lot of what he taught was repeat from my 101 class from my other school but it was a refresher. pass the test he gives you and you will be fine. kind of wishe he would give us grades on our assignments but other than that you watch a lot of viedos for class so make sure you sleep enough or you will fall asleep in there,1
"Katselis tends to just copy straight from the ECE313 course notes when he lectures. Occasionally, he'll bring his own examples into the mix to try to help, but this class was still difficult for me. He is willing to do review days before exams if time permits. Probability and stats just aren't my thing and his teaching methods helped very little.",0
"Professor Perez is a solid instructor. She can be a little snappy sometimes, but she means well. She's tough on attendance and gives minimal but easy hmwk assignments. She also gives extra credit opportunities. Her exams are all info from the slides she lectures in class. Show up, take notes, ask questions (when needed) and you'll do fine.",1
Only a few weeks into the semester and she is literally the best teacher I've ever had in college! She is understanding of us college students and our lives. She deserves an award. So far I am actually understanding and more in depth into the subject because is not a stickler about due dates. We need more professors that care like her!,1
"This teacher is very passionate about his class. However, he is extremely unorganized and does a poor job at keeping your attention during class. He goes off about things that are irrelevant of the lecture. I would NOT recommend taking him for government",0
"Good luck is all I can say. If youre not strong in math or didnt have a great 316 class, you will not pass without a tutor. You ask for help, he tells you to read the book over and over. Youre paying to teach yourself. Only perk is 2 lowest grades for hw / quizzes dropped and one exam too. Nice man, horrible instructor.",0
"Prof. Kolluru is a good professor. However, I believe she is bored with teaching. Her in-class lectures are great, she engages with students. The tough part is the exams. They are nothing like homework or practice material. She will ask you to remember formulas never covered in her class and has questions and has sections designed to trick you.",0
Very Helpful,1
Way to tough on the grading of papers. You are graded by TA's and not the teacher. Lots of papers to do. No book is needed for the course. If you sign up for this course come prepared to work and be graded very hard on papers you write. The only benefit is it's an online class and you get due dates and plenty of time to finish each paper.,0
Dr. Hart has a vast knowledge on biology. The major DOWNFALL of her is her teaching method. She is very unorganized. She goes all over the place with her lectures and gets distracted very easily. Most of the time she wouldn't even lecture. She would just talk about herself. Then she would squeeze in a TON of information in the last 15-20 minutes.,0
horrible teacher. ,0
"Shes amazing. I had her for Contracts 1 and 2, for 9 months of my life. Shes extremely personable and also knowledgeable about Contract Law. I had UCC before Contracts, and I still learned a lot of new things from her. Her exams are hard but practical.",1
"I love Ronda! She is a great teacher and she really pushes you (in a good way) so that you keep up. If you do the homework you will get a good grade, but you will have to do the work. She obviously loves her work and really wants you to succeed. She aspires to make the material understandable and interesting.",1
"i have taken her 3 times. comparative pols, women & politics and feminist theory. she's the best professor i have ever had. she makes you want to read and the classroom environment encourages it as well. tough grader, but you can definitely get an A if you try hard enough. highly recommended. not for the lazy",1
I would NOT recommend taking his class. Avoid if possible. Hes a very tough grader. Sets his expectation for his students very high. Does NOT give good feedback on any essays and makes you figure it out yourself even at a basic level course. Is never satisfied with any essay. Vague topics. One low grade and you can never recover.,0
"Jeannette is awesome. She really cares about each student in her class, and will work with you to improve your business communication skills. The class is tough, but she does a good job of making all of the effort worth it.",1
"Mr. Pilla is the best math professor you'll ever get, hands down. No homework, it's all considered extra credit for tests. There were only 4 tests, and if you get perfect attendance he will drop your lowest grade. He really cares about you passing with a good grade. Just don't be disruptive and pay attention! That's all he cares about.",1
"This class and her coursework is a complete joke. Assigns redundant papers and essays on corny poetry. Does not let you pick your own material to write about. Picks annoying due dates out of thin air. It's an online class, but you may have something due on a tuesday, wednesday, etc. Gives a boatload of easy work, which is annoying. Spare yourself.",0
"he is an amazing teacher and really cares about his students. he gave me a second chance when i messed up in his class. very fair and understanding. loves what he's teaching, and will make you feel welcomed right away. wish i could take more courses with him.",1
Erika is a great teacher. She kept our class going and we had a 3 and a half hour class. She is very intelligent and I enjoyed every minute of her class!! ,1
You should not take HUMAN101 as an online course because you will not have enough time to absorb the material covered. La-turner had no problem letting the students know that he did not like teaching this class online. I think if I had of physically attended the lectures I would've enjoyed it.,0
Tests are much harder then other chem professors. Shes okay for lab but avoid taking her for lecture,0
Very easy class with very straightforward professor. Tests very simillar to practice tests. Open notes. HW and projects easy.,1
"She isn't very friendly and is difficult to communicate with. I found her to be really judgemental. She is a tough grader, so even when you put your 100% effort into an assignment, don't expect to get an A.",0
"The class was exhausting for me. It's very difficult not only to keep up but also to understand what he is saying even if you were at the whole lecture. The exams are the type that have a crazy curve because they are so difficult. On multiple questions, I wasn't sure where to start yet still seemed to preserver. Never again though!!!",0
Took him during Summer Session. Grade is 50% midterm & 50% final 7 essay questions in class no notes. He expects you to attend class. If you didn't do well in an exam he offers other opportunities for you won't fail. Just read your notes and memorize all the key terms w/examples. He curves the class & tries not to hand out anything below a C.,1
"LOTS OF HOMEWORK!!! She sends ""What's Due"" emails after each class. No tests, but if you don't show up, you WILL fall behind. She's very busy, but responds to emails very quickly. She's pretty awesome in general, and really interactive.",1
Professor Trubatch is a nice enough guy but his class is the hardest I have ever taken. My entire class is failing due to a horrible textbook and unclear lectures. Quizzes are nothing like what we do in class. It is defeating that a class full of math majors are failing a math class. I have never put so much in without any results.,0
As a biology major I was required to take Dr. Laycock for general physics 1 and 2. His lectures are okay - you must attend because he does daily clicker questions. The people grading the exams are extremely inconsistent. But the worst part about this guy is that he is a jerk. He belittles students for asking questions that he deems unnecessary,0
Casey is an amazing teacher. Instead of telling you to memorize formulas he actually shows you how and why they work. The grading in this class if very difficult. 55% of your grade is just chapter tests with no retakes. 30% is the final. And 15% homework. Attendance is not required but if you dont go you will not pass the tests.,1
"Ken is one of the greatest teachers I've ever had. REC 1000 is a class that has nothing to do with my major, but I am so grateful I took it especially with Ken. It was at 8am, which I thought I would hate, but he makes it worth it. Don't even question taking this class if you need credits! He's an unforgettable guy, you'll love him.",1
I took him for into to programming and as previous posters have said teaches as if you should already know programming. If I did I wouldn't have had to take programming. I got so behind but got help at the end. I turned in all the labs and homework but still failed yet my partner passed. kinda funny that we turned the same work.,0
"Take this class! Super easy! Tests are simple if you study all the notes online. Attendance is not mandatory but it is extra credit on tests. Lectures can get boring, but still a great class.",1
"hard and rash professor, I event think he's ****, does not help at all, condescending, and rude, study a lot if you are minority, in order to get good grade.",0
"She does not communicate with students, does not give feedback, especially positive feedback. Will deduct points for ANYthing, and does not tell you much other than what you didn't do right. The topics and curriculum are very interesting but DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS. She is not a good professor at all.",0
"Horrible! Gives out worksheets that don't make sense or missing information and don't realize it until someone points it out. Answers very vaguely or his answer isn't helpful at all. Very stressful to work with. Sometimes give you readings that barely if any, helps with the homework. He is the definition of why not everyone should not be a teacher.",0
"AWESOME professor, would take any class of his again in a split second, just do the required readings overnight and be prepared to discuss them the next class period... he is over-helpful and prepares you with ten times the information needed to make a great grade than any other professor will...",1
"nice, funny and hilarious",1
"This guy got a chemistry degree from Israel. I don't  understand why our school of chemical engineering hired him because he obviously doesn't know too much in our field. He made an evident mistake in the class, but when a student pointed it out, he denied it! After that I decided to be absent from the class since I highly doubted his ability.",0
"This professor is awesome. There is really no reason not to do well on your essays. He gives you a chance to let him look them over and also have another student in class look them over. Unless you are just blowing off those chances, there is no way to really fail any of his papers. Try to pick a topic that he's excited about for your final essay.",1
Okay honestly not the best. Teaches trig and I've never struggled so hard in a math class than when I took her. Bad at emailing back. Class average for one of the test was a 37%. Don't take her,0
"I took this class online and we would have a media reflection and discussion board to complete each week! Personally, the book was a blessing to have and I'm not sure how some people took the class without it. It helped that she prepared a study guide for each exam, but make sure you study because the exams are a little hard if you don't read!",1
Such an amazing teacher. Definitely my favorite. Sghe made class so fun. She does this cute little head twist when.... Well you'll see lol.,1
aunave gives easy exams but is hard to understand.  not very helpful and is strict about attendance.  asks for homework randomly which is way lame.  very easy grader though.,0
"Class is easy, but she is unhelpful and sometimes even rude when i try to talk to her outside of class or ask for help. She picks favorites, and makes assumptions about students. She also spend all of class rambling about her son.",0
"Never replies to emails, never clear about assignments, never clear with tests, terrible lecturer",0
Loving this class thus far. Dr. Parker is genuinely interested in listening to us and in improving our writing skills.,1
"Test are incredibly difficult. Very lecture heavy. Very knowledgable over Econ however tends to forget that most of his students aren't. There are 6 tests and he drops the lowest 2, but all of them are relatively difficult",0
"Kildea is one of the coolest dudes you will ever come across! He is absolutely hilarious, intelligent and driven. I really enjoyed his class and his feedback really makes you stronger. His hard work also paid off because he is now the chairman of the communication department and he is a great guy to know in terms of jobs. Stay in touch with him!",1
"She helped with all of my assignments and checked everything before I turned them in. I had an A throughout the entire quarter. At the very end of the course she went into the system and changed all of my grades to failing. I emailed her and she accused me of plagiarism. When I reported her, she failed me, but I was still passing. Discrimination.",0
"If you are reading this, do NOT take this professor. Lectures are long, boring, and unrelative to the course. She is confusing about what she wants to see in assignments/essays. I never know when anything is due because she doesn't go by the syllabus. Pushes political opinions on students too much. Says she wants X but looks for Y.",0
"She is very bubbly, laidback, and nice, and tries her best explaining things, if you talk to her in person or in email. She also gives a lot of extra credit. I ended up with an A+ in her class. She has 3 online exams, 1 major speech, and online assignments. She also gives back feedback during the speech assignments. A very easy class!",1
Overall she's a good teacher. Pro:The test for 101 were easy. Con: You have a quiz which at most is 4 questions from the required reading of maybe the 20 page chapter and its never on the big facts but the smallest details you wouldn't think to remember.,1
"She's a great professor and I learned so much in her class. Her tests are easy, there's a group project which is not difficult at all. She has lots of guest speakers and overall it's a very interesting class and I would recommend it.",1
"Interesting readings, horrible lectures unrelated to quizzes. Spends a lot of time rambling, grades participation but hardly leaves room for discussion. If she calls on you she expects an answer RIGHT AWAY. Made it clear she's teaching ""as if we were on campus"", insensitive to the fact that we have tough living situations. Rude and unapproachable.",0
"She was very unclear with her instructions and her syllabus. The second day of class everyone lost 10 points for not doing an assignment that we were not told about or was stated clearly on the syllabus.
 She also plays favorites and picks on other students.",0
"Pam is a pretty good teacher. Her class is easy, and assignment due dates are always clear and reasonable. The only bad thing about the class is that she talks WAY too much! I often find myself falling asleep! Other than that, I would recommend taking her for ED 320 :)",1
His class average was a 49 till the last week. the entire semester I didnt have above a 76 till the last week of class and I had the highest grade.,0
Super impressive. I suck at accounting and yet he teaches in a way to help us. He is extremely patient and is willing to help you out when ever you need it.,1
"He's such an energetic lecturer- usually I don't pay much attention in class but Professor Ken can get anyone passionate about economics! In fact, it is because of him that I transfered out of management into economics. It also helps that he is v attractive (went to A LOT of office hours)",1
"Mixed feelings. She has days where she's really helpful and then days where you're better off on your own. She's very nice, but tends to speak too quickly for comprehension. Work is easy and straightforward, moderate amount. As long as you finish two assignmnents and a quiz/ week, you're in good shape. Be prepared for major disorganization, though.",0
"His exams have nothing to do with whether you learned the material or not. He simply takes small details from photographs and picture captions and tests your memory, of 8 CHAPTERS AT A TIME!",0
"I enjoyed the course subject, but Dr. Richardson is a bit difficult. Receiving graded papers can take upwards to 4 weeks. The grading rubric and feedback for the papers is vague making it difficult to improve from week to week. The group project assignments are tough to coordinate and complete in 1 week with the amount of research that is expected.",0
He is the worst professor of SMU. He makes the question paper way too difficult and wont given consider students problems. He does not reply to emails. Because of him I had to fail the course. Not at all Recommended,0
"Do NOT take this class with this professor!!! She is a tough grader and can come off very rude when you have questions. I would go above and beyond, completed all of my work on time and always received zeros. Best advise I could give other students is to find another professor to take BIO with. I never write reviews but I had to warn you guys!",0
"Awesome dude. Definitely have to attend the lectures AND read the online TB if you want an A, but it's not very difficult if you keep up with them. Passionate about his field and is very good at expressing and explaining that passion. Some EC but you can certainly get an A without it.",1
"The absolute best instructor I've had at Baker. Most instructors don't understand learning online, but Vincent absolutely does. He gives great feedback and the tools to actually learn.",1
boring class ..cant keep students attention ..knows his material but has a hard time putting it into simple terms,0
"Professor MacPherson's lectures were very interesting. However, they seemed to go on forever, and the class ambience was tense. We had a two exams and two quizzes. The exams were hard and confusing. The quizzes were not that easy either. We wrote two difficult papers -follow his instructions-but he would give you some feedback before submitting it.",0
"The ""professor"" was absolutely terrible. Nothing but simplified lecture straight from a power point. When asked anything, her only response was to look through the power-point. When asked if she could demonstrate the MMC, she replied I don't know what that is"". One project toward the end of the year accounted for a large majority of our grade. F-",0
DOES NOT TEACH. All he does is hand out notes and worksheets. The w/s are fill in missing code but he has it completed displayed on the projector. the w/s are only worth 30pts. tests are hard and home work is moderately difficult. YOU MUST TEACH YOUR SELF. ONE OF THE WORST TEACHERS I HAVE EVER HAD! The book is bad too. Good Luck u need it! >:(,0
"Nice lady, but i didn't think she taught very well when it came to Math. I'm taking her again just because her time slot fits my schedule but i would much rather have someone else that fit my learning style. On the nicer side, math is math so if you dont learn from the teacher, maybe youll learn from a tutor. Best of luck! She's very nice though.",0
"It was a once-a-week class, but we missed several due to weather and class was super unorganized because of it. I had a fair amount of homework, but it might have been less if we had more classes. Also, she lectures a TON and the group project is described pretty poorly. Our group was so confused on how to do the research and presentation.",0
Prof. Lohrey is always ready and willing to answer any questions you have. That is mostly how he runs his class-he wants you to go in and ask questions about anything you have trouble with. Do the Wiley homework because it WILL help you on the tests. He even told us exactly which kind of problems were going to be on the test!!! That helped A LOT.,1
"Miranda is a true gem. She's the spazziest professor i've had, but that's okay. She makes up for it from her hilariously bubbly personality and her sassy wit. She truly cares about her students and wants everyone to pass. This class was super easy, as long as you put effort into your performances, you'll get an A. I know you read these Miranda, ILY",1
"Lots of homework, lots of work for the labs, and pretty much no clear rubrics or guides for anything. There are very few resources that actually help, but with all this said, I was working 40 hours a week and managed to get a B so if you're doing nothing over the summer you could get an A.",0
"I had her fall semester and she was very unclear but I thought it was the language barrier but it was not. I stood in her class till the end which was a huge mistake. She is very specific in what she wanted and you got no credit if you didn't follow her ""format"" (you just fold a paper a certain way) or not complete sentences. It's math..",0
"I highly suggest to not take Dr. Bush pre-calc online course! Unless you are okay to teach yourself about this course with ""0"" lecture. The only way I could learn something was by doing the homework. Nothing more than that was ever offered. Theres 2 exams and no extra credit! Actually there was 5 points*. Thanks Wendy! But srly, do not take her!!!",0
"He's awesome! Would definitely take again. Super nice, gives clear criteria. Cornell notes are really annoying, but you can use notes on the weekly group quizzes (which are easy too). I learned a lot in this course, even thought I'm not a computer science major or anything. Focus is on Microsoft Office, Word, Excel, Access, and Powerpoint.",1
Great Teacher who really knows his stuff. He has very impressive work and is enthusiastic to share his knowledge with students in the class. This is not a blow-off class the work is hard and time consuming. Great class if you want to really learn about Graphic Design!,1
"This guy is a jerk and a half- he seems like he knows what he's doing in lectures but if you talk to him individually, he'll treat you with utmost disdain.  He shows up at class like 10 minutes late and then blames class being late on the computer and projector and then treats the repair people with comtempt.  What an a$$h0le of an individual.",0
Everything to her is about the American Dream. We didnt even learn how to to do anything she just had us write papers over the American Dream. Multiple papers and presentations over the same topic and wanted new information in each different assignment like what do you expect if were doing he same thing over and over again.,0
Literally the worst class I've taken at WCSU. Her grading system is a bust. She is a hard grader & makes you redo your work over & over again. Even meeting with her over Webex is a bust as she just tells you if you don't understand the work then settle for a lower grade. Would never recommend her. This class will end up giving you endless stress.,0
As long as you dont give up and improve every quiz. you will do fine. Prof. Kern was a caring man. I respect him. He is a person that loves math and deserves a chance. He is a good person that will help you. Just wants his students to succeed.. I will recommend if you are willing to put in the work.,1
"Easy to take notes with the way he teaches, hes very clear. Just graded on homework, (and you can easily get 100% on each homework assignment) we only had 4 tests, and multiple opportunities for extra credit! The only thing I wish I could change is being able to use notes for the tests but otherwise overall good experience with this professor!",1
Homework every class containing about 20 questions. Each assignment takes about an hour to complete. Couldn't fully understand his demos.,0
"Nolan was an excellent PSYCH professor.  You really need to attend class, as her PPTs are bare boned and she teaches in more of a lecture style.  Tests are a little challenging - just study and you'll do fine!",1
O chem isn't the most interesting subject out there. Nor is it one of the easiest. Dr. Kennedy tries to make the course interesting (as best as the material allows him) and is always willing to help out. He even started a weekly study session outside of class. Be prepared to study A LOT.  Ask questions. Your grade at the end reflects your effort.,1
"I waited 3 semesters for this class to become available but regret taking it. Keyes is a subpar prof. Participation is required but she berates students if she does not agree w/ them. 2 tests w/ 10 questions, mostly on details hardly discussed in class. She became more hostile throughout semester. Dreaded going to every class.",0
"Best Instructor I ever had. Can't say enough good. Sometimes had class at Coffee shops, and in Uban Min. Met at them alot.",1
"Dr. Mitchell was very loud, funny, and outspoken (can be seen as rude). No homework, 4 exams, and 10 labs. Labs are worth 200 points, since he drops the 2 lowest. Do labs for an easy 200 points. First two exams are very hard, which weeds many students out. Stick to the final 2 and they get much easier. Drops lowest exam. Hard but passable class.",0
"Six tests are given through the semester. All tests are free response, but he does provide prototype exams that are very similar to the tests. Also he assigns 4 take home papers that are worth the same amount as test and are somewhat easy. If you pay attention in class and do the practice exams you should be fine.",1
I would definitely recommend her as a prof. She is very clear about HOW you are being graded as well as your progress (unlike my last teacher). She clarifies things very well! Really enjoyed this class despite taking it in the 7 week summer session!,1
"He is a really nice man and a kind teacher but he does expect you to know things beforehand which is not always true. He does not really teach during his lectures, I think the book helped us learn how to code more than him. He is willing to answer questions and help you. His wording in assignments tends to be confusing,",0
"Unfortunately, I thought professor dutz was going to be a lot better than she was taking into consideration all of her positive reviews. she organizes the class in the most inefficient way possible, 2 tests practically determine your grade and all you do the entire class is a packet full of questions and a meaningless lab. Go to OCC for chem",0
"Just finished up A&P1 spring 2018 with Prof Zeman. She really is a wonderful teacher, the best I have had at RCC so far. She is so funny, and tells it how it is. She can totally relate to students as she was a student herself not that long ago so she gets it. Only wish she were teaching A&P 2. Definitely take her, you wont find anyone better!",1
"He make everything extremely difficult and he doesn't know what he is talking about.  Watch how he grades things because he tends to get very ""take off points for little things"" happy.",0
"Way too involved for an intro class - if you didn't participate every day, points were deducted. He is very condescending and rude at best, but he definitely knows his stuff. He sent me to the writing center after I turned in a paper, and I told him I worked there (lol). Said the ""tone"" was inappropriate for the in essay exam but refused to explain",0
"Melissa's the absolute best. I was in her first class at Mizzou, I took her 2880 class too, and I'd have taken her 4880 if it was offered at the time. She's so kind and chill and clear and she's not a hard grader. Her class is 2 1/2 hours and it's a joy. Also yeah, you'll totally fall in love with her.",1
"Wonderful professor and a wonderful woman! Her enthusiasm in what she was teaching kept me going through the course. If you need help, just ask for it!",1
"Hamed is such a genius professor, he wants you to learn, therefore, his exams and homework assignments are very clear. There is no better than Hamed to teach DS412. take him you won't regret it. 3 midterms in total plus HW. that's it folks",1
"Sweetha is literally the sweetest TA! She comes across as tough but she was really understanding. The labs went by quickly and everything was very straightforward. Her quizzes are tough, but if you know your material and read the lab manual ahead of time, you'll absolutely ace this class. Just make sure you pay attention and stay respectful!",1
"She's a Really good teacher. The discussion were very interesting. Its very basic. 2 quizzes,2 exams,2 papers, and 1 group project. Lots of chances to recope your grade.",1
"This manz is great, hes so caring and funny!! He does not give you too much homework. Hes so chill about everything. Honestly just show up to class and do your work on time and you'll get an A. He is the best professor here at NOVA. 10/10",1
"Very good person but very hard to understand. He is all over the place, coming in and out of the textbook, sometimes using it but then crafting his own thought as well. Never gave any homework only quizzes. No tests or final.",0
"Honestly, the fact that he taught w/ Shinkle made him look better. But make no mistake, his modules were extremely difficult. The fact that he doesn't post his slides makes it hard to take notes. I got the sense that he & Shinkle were kinda just making it up as they went along. Generally it's an awful experience, but at least he has jokes I guess?",1
Shes so mean!!! Humiliates her students in front of the class and makes them feel dumb. I left her cpr class wanting to cry. She talks to her students like kids who are in trouble with their parents,0
"probably one of my favorite teachers at app! very friendly, dedicated to helping you get the most out of her class. her teaching methods are fun and creative, and working with the room 13 kids was great. definitely take a class with her if you get the chance.",1
She us rude and needs to get over herself. And her techniques are outdated,0
Loved this guy! Took in summer 1 and highly recommend it! He helps during tests and anytime you need it! Nice guy!,1
"Took his class fall semester 2012! You'll want to be prepared for a lot of homework and you will learn. Glad I took this course, just didn't put the work in like should of. You want an easy grade choose someone else.",1
His grading is the worst.  He does not answer quistions.  He explains for himself.  Always make mistakes and then says you can fix it at home.  Too long exams where you cant do them on time.,0
"Well, this is week one of her class... i have not spent about 16 hours over this weekend writing her chapter summarizes and have another whole chapter to go. I am a graduate of a nursing program and currently quit my job to accommodate classes for a higher degree in nursing. Yes i am taking biology again due to credits not transferring.........",0
"If he gives extra credit? It wont do anything for your grade. The grading criteria is all over the place, hes all over the place with what classes hes talking to, where were at in lecture and reading. And lastly, dont except to pass this class with an A+ if you arent totally in love with ethics.",0
"DO NOT take this class! This was for an elective credit and the worse class I have taken by far. Way too much work for an ""Academic Success"" course. I wrote over 10,000 words throughout the semester for weekly Journals. He would write comments like ""Nice job keep it up"" then take points off. It's a semester worth of busy work, save yourself!",0
"Mr. Jiao is a great professor, will work with you if you need help. Show up to class, pay attention to lectures and you will most likely pass. He does a good job explaining lectures on power point. Overall a great understanding teacher.",1
Awesome professor. His test cover alot of material which can be difficult to remember at times.,1
"Holly was the most difficult Professor I have ever had at SCAD. Her class was full of unclear homework and project assignments. She not only wants you to be an expert at using the programs, but wants your work to be grad level design work, ridiculous for an intro class. We should not have to use YouTube to teach a class we're paying someone $4k for",0
So much homework for only 1 credit. I mean really. This class is a waste of time but unfortunately needed to go to a university. So yeah hated it.,0
Très dur à suivre. Se perd souvent dans ses idées. Ses examens sont mal corrigés/construits. Il est dur à rejoindre/à rencontrer. Ne suit pas son plan de cours.,0
I don't recommend her if you need extra help. I couldn't understand her very well and her method of teaching made it extremely frustrating. She likes to do the hard way before she shows you the easy way and won't fully answer your question. Even if you're good at math i would still hesitate to take this class.,0
"He's kind of all over the place, we pretty much focused on the same topic all semester so I didn't feel like I learned all that much. He has a very specific way of thinking so on assignments and tests you have to keep that in mind. Overall I really wish I hadn't taken this class.",0
"Mr. Carson was a nice man, however as a professor he would often treat us like freshmen in high school. The first 3 weeks were about MLA. The class became tedious and almost painful to go to. He would provide good feedback on papers, however there were ALOT of them. I liked him just not his class. He said attendance was mandatory but never checks.",0
really helpful.  anytime you need to see her she is willing to meet. gave me a lot of good study tips.,1
"if you have to avoid one thing at UConn is this guy. yes you might try your best to understand the class but taking him will take the interest of math out of you. its a no no, never take him, you you will be clue less the all semester and get bad grade.",0
"Nice professor but the class is boring, alot of the stuff is repetitive. Dont really need the book, maybe just for the essay. To get an A you must know her powerpoints very well, better off memorizing them.",1
"I've had the privilege of knowing Mr. Henson over the years and eventually took one of his classes. You;ll never find a greater teacher or a greater man. Knowing him was inspirational and he truly is a pillar of our small town college and our town. Whenever he retires, there will be mighty be shoes to fill.",1
"Her quizzes are difficult, her exams are impossible, and her explanations are generally not helpful.  She's always late to class and takes extremely long to return assignments.  Avoid.",0
Had this class online. Professor Bazil does not communicate much and this caused problems sometimes. You watch his lecture videos for a certain module and then take a short quiz. There are 4 papers throughout the class. The online setup could have been better. Easy A though.,0
I don't get it this teacher is a master at making people think she's something she's not.  What she has been is incredibly rude and just spiteful to me.  Doesn't anyone else see what's really going on?  Shes the reason my husband dropped out.,0
I had her for my Advanced topics in Cognitive psych class (Spring 2018). Homework is pointless busy work. Group projects that she expects perfection on. More pointless memory journals. Final paper is expected to be like a PhD thesis. Feeback very unclear. No tests. Attendance not mandatory but participation is a huge part of grade.,0
"I love Ms. V. Shes very straight forward with what she wants from you and her rubrics are very detailed. As long as youre willing to do the work and be respectful in class, youre sure to get a good grade! Textbook is needed theres chapter quizzes every week and a half. But its not difficult if you actually read!",1
"Will is an entertaining lecturer. I was always engaged in class. However, the way the class is set out... prepared to be confused. He will give you 7 readings, and a podcast, and youtube videos, that need to be reviewed before class. Knowing what is important is difficult. Also, he refuses to answer my emails. Actually, my TA has yet to respond.",1
"I would never, ever recommend taking this course or this professor.  He graded so hard that it was impossible to please him.  I have a 3.9 GPA but I will be lucky to get a C in this course.  For a 100 course it is ridiculous.",0
Good class. The lecture part was interesting. Can be a hard grader but fair. Always willing to help.,1
"If you have him for microelectronics, do not expect to learn anything from him. My advice is to find a better textbook, and follow an online class so you can learn the the material. When midterm comes, copy every useless and very confusing assignment questions that don't teach you anything on your cheat sheet.",0
He is the hardest teacher I've ever took.  He flunk the whole class and now retaking him.,0
The meanest professor I have ever encountered at UW. Never put her feet into students' shoes!!! Switched out of her section after she mocked at me because I got one clicker question wrong!!!,0
"Transitioning to online classes were alright. The lectures didn't line up directly with the homework. He got off topic a lot. Jokes would have been funny if we were in class, but was messy with teaching. All you have to do is the work assigned. He was awesome about turn in days. Am I ready for Chem160? Not that confident. But basics learned I guess",0
"De Francesco is a mad lad. We stick on one PowerPoint for two full weeks and still learn nothing. Sticks you in groups with classmates even when you tell him you can't work with them. Always finds something to say about everyone, even if it's kind of insulting. Wouldn't take him if his classes weren't required for my degree completion.",0
"Walker is hands down the best teacher I have ever had at LSU so far. His lectures are very entertaining and participation does matter, but I loved going to his class so that was never a problem for me. He cares a lot about his students and is so funny.",1
"You wont regret taking him, you will learn a lot and he makes classes very enjoyable.",1
"This professor is very knowlegdable but it would be nice if he could communicate well enough to impart some of that knowledge, Communication/language barier is a serious handicap to his ability to instruct. The only people who suffer are the ones who wait in hope that they will soon understand him and then lose their money by the time they realize.",0
"Dr. Zwier's p-chem class was tough, but he is an *amazing* instructor. He takes very difficult concepts and turns them into ""Oh. That's so completely obvious"" moments. Homework and tests are difficult, but he's big on take-home and group work. READ YOUR TEXTBOOK, go to lectures, and you'll get through p-chem with no problems!",1
Really tough Professor. Not reachable by email which is the only way to communicate now.,0
"She is a great teacher and she knows her stuff. But, if you need an answer, you better send your question a lot earlier, because she won't answer your question right away. DAAC classes involved with a lot wring anyways and on top of that you will not get graded, So you'll never know you passed or failed until class is over about 2-3 weeks. ",1
Would not count my make up work for participation and homework which is worth 20 percent of the course. Which would have given me a C. heartless. If you want a teacher whos flexible don't take him.,0
JOKE. I learned more about time and territory management during my summer internship.,0
"Very nice guy, and appropriately funny. My GOD does this guy give harder exams. Just like Horstmann grading structure. Class average on first exam was 21/50 but half the class did ereally well and other half did not. Too much assignment u wouldnt finish unless only taking 2 classes that semester. After exam 1 and 3 HW I was discouraged to work hard",0
Excellent Professor!,1
"I really recommend taking her bio 126 class. Mrs Williams is so smart, but kind and gives you all the information you need to know. She always encourages you to give answers in class and really engages you throughout lecture. :)",1
"i do not understand how she has 100% rate on taking her again as a professor. She is very tough and treats her students like they do not know anything. Only she does. Honestly, she can be rude at times. Her material is hard and overwhelming. You must come home and teach yourself the chapter because all she does is talk about her stories.",0
i had her freshman year and she is the best professor omg she is so chill with things and makes class so fun,1
I had her for my BCOM LAB and she is a gem. Just show up for kahoot and you should pass the lab.,1
Extremely unhelpful and cancelled office hours frequently.  Tests were very difficult and had questions that weren't anything like our homework or lecture examples.  He used different notation and equations than our textbook which made following him in lecture difficult.  Doesn't post any lecture notes or solutions to homework or tests online.   ,0
"If you have the option to take another teacher, go for it. She's unclear about what she wants due for class.",0
"Class is a waste of my time. A lot of unnecessary effort and work for an A while you can put in minimal amount of work in another teacher's class. Assignments are easy but waste of time as well. Essays are graded harshly, so if they aren't your strong point, don't take the class.",0
"Difficult, unhelpful, unresponsive to questions, designed to make you struggle and fail.",0
"She doesn't explain anything!! She is just a very mediocre teacher, and that is being nice. She moves WAY too fast, doesn't explain anything, & doesn't know how to answer students' questions.",0
Worst teacher ever!! I did not learned a thing in his class and for that I suffered in my next English classes. If you want to learn DO NOT TAKE NORTON!,0
"Interesting, but you have to be into it. It's like learning a new language and you have to learn how to speak it fluently in order to keep up. Learning the language is not hard if you are willing to put in about an hour a week into this class.",1
He is an amazing teacher and person you can always go to him for help or if your just having a bad day. He is a great listener and will do his best to help in any way possible. Really wish he taught more classes so I could have him as a teacher again.,1
Amazing teacher. Made learning fun and very helpful,1
"Lectures are long and terrible. She gives no guidance, she just flies through them leaving little room for anyone to even comprehend what the heck she's doing.  She also gives NEW material for the test on ""review day"". Her tests are hard. Don't expect any kind of extra credit or help with your grades. FIND A DIFFERENT TEACHER. ",0
"Professor Sbragia is incredibly passionate about the course material, and he makes it easy to be interested in the material. By far one of my favorite professors I've had",1
"Richard is the best professor I have had. He makes class interesting and it is obvious how much he loves his job and truly cares for each of his students. A wonderful professor and a wonderful person. He doesn't use a text book to teach, but instead his own vastly extensive knowledge. Take this class. ",1
"Quizzes are online and easy. 3 exams, final exam is optional if you're happy with your grade. One community based assignment that includes a paper. Attendance isn't mandatory but it kind of is since she gives 12 in-class assignments and she doesn't tell you when they will be given. She drops 2 of them. Read the PDF files, most helpful for exams!!!",1
"Come to class and participate and you will understand what you are doing. If you dont come to class what do you expect to know? Easy stuff, come to class do the class assignments then you'll do great. Excellent professor! Would recommend!",1
Worst teacher I have ever had. He does not help much when asking for feedback. The test a very difficult because of the abundance of information needed to learn in a short period of time. Very wishy washy with extra credit and quizzes in between other Chemistry class.,0
Love Dr. Chalk!! Great class that is always interesting and sparks class discussions. Can't wait to take another class with her!,1
Encourages learning will stay after class to help of needed,1
"The guy hasn't given an A on an essay this semester.  Makes you turn in a rough draft then tears all your ideas apart.  No chance to get anything higher than a 3.3.  Anyone who says ""A B is a good grade"" in his syllabus is not a teacher to take.",0
"Dr. Stephens's class was the hardest class I had in the semester. She doesn't know how to work a computer very well so her handouts are hard to read and understand. Her directions are unclear! It took me an hour just to comprehend what she was asking me to do and I still didn't do the assignment right, but neither did the majority of the class.",0
you have to do learn smart!! its just a lot when your taking 4-5 classes. tests are not easy at all each questions talks about 2-3 different topics so its confusing at times ... GOOOODLUCK WITH THIS PROFESSOR U'll need it for anatomy 425,0
"If you want a lazy class and hope to pass, this is the teacher for you. You don't need to read, just show up to every class and turn in the work. There's only 6 essays, this including midterm and final. Don't expect to learn, challenge or know what is going on in class. If you ask him for help, you'll be more confused than before.",0
Class is very easy. Just do not take it in the mornings. She has a lot of energy and always requires participation.,1
"She is abysmal. Completely and utterly vague and when she ""clarifies,"" she only causes more confusion. Probably one of the least effective teachers I've had in an institution of higher learning.",0
Lots of work but you can revise and you actually learn to write! Good professor -he rocks1,1
"The very good professor, you just need to follow the class and review the practice exam, then you will do a great job in this class.",1
"Professor Cirilo is an amazing professor. She's very caring and easy-going on. You do have to read in order to pass this course. The exams are not too tough, as long as you read. The final was a little tougher than the exams. Discussions are fairly easy, but it does require to think some. She does offer extra credit. Very easy A, if you read!",1
Love this class. Tests is multiple choice  and they're easy if you study only! He truly cares about his students and wants you to learn. Definitely recommend him.,1
Not clear on grading and basically impossible to get an A. You can follow feedback after feedback and never be given higher than a B unless she likes you. For our final project she didn't have any feedback and nobody got more than a low A no matter what. Seems impossible to please.,0
"This class was amazing, a great professor that makes learn English an enjoyable journey.",1
Jacki is an awesome professor. She wants her students to be successful and take something away from her class. History of Economic Doctrine was extremely interesting and she helps you understand its importance in overall economic theory and practice.,1
"Doable amount of homework assigned everybody class, collected 1x a week. Some of the questions are hard and werent covered in class but the test reflects the easier part of hw. 2 tests and 1 final. Dont skip class and dont zone out or youll be left behind. Doesnt use canvas/moodle so youll only know your grade after. He does go over tests",1
Professor Corker is smart but she really doesnt seem care about her students. I dont recommend taking her class.,0
"one of the best teacher's I've ever had at Tech. She made me actually want to go to class, and her in class activities helped me remember a lot of the new vocab/verb conjugations. Highly recommend taking her if you can, you won't regret",1
The class is sorta boring and you really need to pay attention to grasp whats going on. Tests are almost identical to practice but the final was pretty tough.,0
The PR LAb is an amazing experience!  I have been in it for a few years now and Dr. Matera really prepares you for a career in the PR world.  The students I have worked with have won countless awards along with received jobs as soon as they got out of college.  I really suggest you try this class if you want to do Public Relations,1
"I took him for Calc II, and would not recommend him if you're going on to take Calc III. I need Calc III and I do not feel prepared at all. I taught myself almost everything I learned in this class because he does not give good lectures. Not many notes, lots of example problems.  If you end up taking him, read the book before going to each class.",0
"Totally incompetent.  Will spend 10 minutes giving an example, only to realize she did the whole thing wrong and have to go back and re-do it.  Totally useless topic and I can't believe people actually devote their lives to studying it.",0
"If you don't know how to use the camera or Premiere, she'll say to watch YouTube or read the manuals instead of teaching. Every film is an art film that needs a political or psychological undertone. You have a week and a half to do all the filming and editing for a project, show it for rough cut, and then reshoot and edit the whole thing in 2 days.",0
She does not seem to care what so ever. The way she teaches is ineffective and in not thorough. She acts like her students are a hassle. She has a poorcareless attitude. I would definitely not recommend her.  She skips over examples that she is supposerequired to teach out of the manual to help us better understand our assignments. She is awful.,0
"He is the sweetest professor everrr!  the class is a joke, if you get As on the first two essays he won't even read the rest and will give you As for the rest. No tests, only 1 research paper (5pgs including outline, coversheet, and works cited) 1 book report that you will have to share to the class and 3 essays. Easy A would take again!",1
"Trina is such a good teacher, I would recommend her 1000% over any chemistry teacher I had. She genuinely cares about teaching and helping students learn.",1
he was the best teacher I ever had. I am now a year out of him being my English teacher and I came on here to express how amazing he was. he was SO clear on what he expected in papers and uses many class days to go over and help you make sure you get an A. the only way you will not get an A is if you don't listen to him and do the work accordingly.,1
Thanks for a great semester.,1
Professor thornton is really good. He is always there to help students and he really curves a lot.,1
"3 main stories you have to write, 2 blog posts which is part of a group project, a mini-newscast (easy) and quizzes make up your grade. Nan is a very tough grader but really makes you work for it! It challenged me to be a better writer and I learned so much. She knew what she was talking about. Overall I loved this class, just be prepared to work",1
"Mr. Susott is an excellent teacher. He relates well, and keeps things interesting. If you are looking for a history class where you are going to talk about battles, stratagies and generals, this is not for you. You will learn something, and it will change the way you look at history. Take this class",1
She is an awesome professor.  I highly recommend this class.  I took the course as an elective.  I worked very hard and I am sure I did well.  The money I invested in learning was a successful ending.  I recommend this class.  It is a lot of work and you have to work hard but you LEARN!!  If that is what you want to get out of the course.,1
Goes fast during lectures on important concepts. Assigns way too much reading for the 2nd half of the semester. Does not hold office hours. Cold calls during class.,0
"Hard semesters since Fall 2015.  Mr. Haze cares and is juggling a lot.  I learned a lot, mosly how to be patient with not so committed classmates.  He could have clamped down on the less serious students.",1
She doesn't grade easy but I actually understand the language now. She doesn't slow down and it was hard at the start of class but i feel like I understand how real French sounds. ALWAYS  be ready to talk because she randomly calls on people. She can be kind of tough but she is helpful outside class and gave me tons of advice about study abroad.,1
"I've had JPow for three classes. If you attend his class & do the homework, you will learn & do fine in the course. In terms of class structure, you have to turn in completed problem sets every Friday, and the class is lectured-based. There tend to be two mid-term exams and a final exam. Exams hold a heavy-weight so be sure to do well on them!",1
"Others here have said that Dr. Marni is a professor who cares and wants you to do well, which is absolutely true. Unfortunately she is not a skilled lecturer/teacher and she lacks the ability to convey topics to students in an understandable way. Do not take unless you're confident in your ability to self-teach the course through outside reading.",0
All the exams are take home but the problems on the exam are much harder than the ones we do in class. She is a great teacher she helps you a lot just make sure you go to class. I would not recommend and 7 week course. The class moves extremely fast.,1
LOVED cathy! She explained everything thoroughly and if you didn't understand it she would put it into a different perspective. She had mini quizzes each week and i would highly suggest taking advantage of open lab!,1
"If you care about cognitive psych, take this class with someone else. If you don't care about cognitive psych, find another class--don't suffer through this one. He tends to spend 5-10 on slides with less than 15 words on them. Know the studies, or better yet, just don't take this class with him.",0
Absolutely awful! Avoid at all costs. She's a terrible instructor. You have been warned! she doesn't teach. Host study sessions but gets aggravated if you ask a question and says you should have learned that in undergraduate accounting. Literally the worst professor I've ever had.,0
"She is very boring, has surprise quizzes so you have to come to lecture, and is very unhelpful.  Quizzes and tests suck.",0
"The class was fairly easy, but her lectures were bad. Spends most of the time talking about her personal life, then has to speed-read off the slides for the remainder of class. Kind of homework-heavy but not hard, just tedious. I wouldn't want to take her again, but I've heard there are way worse psych profs here, so do with that what you will.",0
"great guy and good professor. However, the grading criteria in this class is ridiculous. it is almost impossible to get a 4.0 in this class. the test are not that bad but he gives no concept list ahead of time and there is zero extra credit in the class. if you are worried about your GPA and want to keep it high, I would not recommend his class.",0
"She doesnt teach the material in class, instead she makes you watch videos at home at teach yourself. Videos have bad audio and do a poor job of teaching the material. Exams were long and difficult, good luck finishing them on time. If you use a different method than the one from the videos, she docks tons of points and accuses you of cheating.",0
"Professor Knapp is a great online teacher. He lays everything out for you, you just have to follow the instructions. You have to read and do the work to get an A, but he lets you do all of the homework all at once if you want. If you work ahead like he says, the class is a breeze. I did my homework up to the quiz once every few weeks.",1
"The way the professor set up the discussion boards. Rather than just asking us to regurgitate the information back to her, she asked for our perspectives about each subject we were learning. It created some great discussions between classmates.  It was on line, but I loved this class.",1
Probably one of the most difficult professors I've had. Didn't grade anything until the very last week of the semester and her office hours were never available. Everything was given vague and hard to understand instructions. She was very sweet but I don't think online learning is suited for her. I'm not even sure what my grade is in the class.,0
I think she make english easy and she lets you be creative with your writting. If you just need to get through english and it is not your fav. subject then this teacher is for you.,1
"Took a blended class of hers. Classes are easy but this one is quite a bit of work. She takes a couple months to grade assignments but is understanding and nice about a lot of things. Oh and never worry about being late because normally she is 10-30mins late usually each class. Dont worry about being absent either, she doesnt really care.",1
"The worst I've had. She picks a couple of students in as her favorites, and it is disgustinly obvious who they are all semester long. She was my advisor and did not advise me at all - didn't have a grasp of the requirements at HWS. Spends too much time in the bars trying to be your friend when she should concentrate on being a better professor.",0
STRICT ATTENDANCE POLICIES AND PARTICIPATION REQUIREMENTS; CONFUSING LECTURES; TIMELY BASED STRUCTURED ONLINE DISCUSSIONS; NO VIA E-MAIL ADDRESS REPLIES FOR RECEIVING ACCOMMODATION SERVICES ON IMPORTANT GROUP WORK ASSIGNMENTS/PROJECTS. Make sure you request INTENSIVE TUTORING SERVICES and verifiable CRC counseling support mentors to obtain success.,0
"Nice professor ,but she assigns 20+ pages to read for homework, and  gives quizzes over it the next day, she is also quiz crazy. A chapter quiz every Monday, essay quiz every Wednesday, map quiz every Friday  on 15 out of 60 places and both chapter and map quizzes are hard. Her exams are the quizzes. Don't take if you are loaded with courses.",0
Did not return any quizzes or tests during semester and never made quizzes passable (ex: asking character's appearance questions in the Great Gatsby),0
"Her teaching style isnt very helpful at all. All she does is show examples of other artists and past student drawings, and sets up things for you to draw and tells you to draw what you see. She doesnt go in depth with explanations and ive never seen her draw anything. This class is for someone who is already somewhat decent at drawing",0
"Stay away!!! Took her for two online courses and she is a very tough grader. Assigns discussions+comments every week, (not terrible) but she barely ever gives full credit for them. You NEED textbook for her or else she'll give low grades. 3 to 4 tests, makes you work for them. Don't miss assignments or turn in late ones. She WILL flag you.",0
"ACC2203 is HARD. Very HARD. Number one tip? GET THE FREAKING BOOK AND READ IT. THEN READ IT AGAIN. This class builds on ACC2101 which was already a hard class and takes it to the next level. Expect and online class with online homework and exams. Prof. Ozbilgin is ok, very responsive and provides help through slides etc. Final exam is hard!",1
"She is a wonderful woman. She is very accessible. She knows a lot about the subject she is teaching, as well as resources and such on campus. She is passionate about her work.",1
"Professor Hulsey, is NOT someone i would recommend to my worst enemy. She gives ALOT of grades so its not impossible to make a good grade. But class is useless because she just rambles about things she 'thinks' we struggle with. Needless to say, it is absolutely no help. Class is useless to go to, test average around 50-60, and she's no help.",0
"Literally one of the worst classes I've ever taken. Very unfair with grading assignments. His standards, requirements, and grading techniques changed based on whatever his mood inspired. Narcissistic, condescending, lacks experience. Contradicts himself often. I do not recommend taking a class with Hass.",0
"Good, easy professor who doesn't grade tough. Show up to class and talk, you'll get the A.",1
"Pretty cool guy easy class. Two open book test, small paper like half a page,and a group debate. Pretty fun overall he has an accent but that's easy to get over definitely take his class. :)",1
"Avoid this course. -The exams aren't limited to the learning objectives. What's the point of the learning objectives is, if not to focus studying? -Exams focus more on memorization than on conceptual understanding. -The textbook is custom, with chapters from different books. This sucks if a chapter refers to a page we don't have access to.",0
GPA killer . During this whole pandemic he didnt care at all. Homework Heavy and doesnt know how to teach. Constantly tells us if we where to read the textbook we wouldnt be doing this poorly. If your trying to get an easy A because of this pandemic run away. He doesnt curve and changed up everyone's exam so no Cheating.,0
"  I would not take this class again. Professor is very blunt and seems clear, but when it comes to lab tests the material is not familiar. Lecture tests were okay, but I felt like Lab tests were an impossibility. I didn't know anyone who recieved an A on a lab exam, for that matter I didn't know one classmate who didn't agree with me. ",0
Je l'ai détesté... il se prend pour un dieu! Moi je trouve que c'est un trou de cul... Il n'est pas professionnel pour deux cents.... Je ne comprends pas pourquoi on le laisse enseigner...,1
"This is my second semester with Dr. Hug and I cannot recommend her enough. She is easily the best professor I have ever had. She gets you interested in the subject, presents material well, and is very helpful if you go to her. She is not only an amazing and hilarious person, but exceptionally knowledgable and an overall amazing professor!",1
"I loved Señora Pilkington! She's super sweet and really cares to get to know all of her students. English was her first language so she doesn't have an accent, and repeats important stuff and makes sure you understand. I definitely learned a lot in her class and did more speaking than previous classes, so I definitely recommend!",1
"Took two seminars with Prof. Tone (424 & 457) and loved every minute. She is an excellent professor who is firm but fair, and who will challenge you without being condescending. A genuinely nice and helpful woman with fascinating (and entertaining) stories. Reading load and workload are reasonable. Materials are interesting.",1
Goes super in-depth more than you need to know she thinks that we are all medical students,0
"Lectures from beginning to end, without giving students opportunity to fully digest material. Professor Li is kind, but does not explain things very well.",0
"You should only take her class if you are proficient in math. She makes many mistakes and often gets confused. A nice lady, though.",0
"she is an awesome teacher. Yes you do work, but there's a lot of in class work projects, so that was very nice. participation is required and attendance counts. Don't hesitate to take her. she is so kind and so helpful",1
"Really cares about what he teaches. When I become a professional, I would like to be like him!!!",1
"If you take one of his classes be prepared for class you will be called upon to answer questions.  You will be embarrassed in front of the class. Be prepared to provide supporting data for answers.  There is alot of discussion as part of this course, but I did not find it to be a supportive environment.",0
Upper lvl philosophy. Hard. Seemed like the people who really got into it were those more naturally inclined to the subject. First time I wanted to stab my skull with an icepick during class. Prof. loves his stuff so that makes learning easier. You earn your grade. Not hot (not ugly)- some people must be  smoking here.,1
"As a graduate student, I've had a lot of teachers/professors in my life and I can without a doubt say this is in my bottom 2. He expects you to teach yourself EVERYTHING and then gives 6+ hour homework assignments that he takes 4 weeks to grade. It's all so selfish and disrespectful and a waste of my money.",0
"I am in in her Biology 120 lab. This professor is unreliable and uncommunicative. She also does not answer your question when you email her, and if she does its 2 word answers. I would not take her class if possible.",0
Very nice and helpful but very difficult. he makes class very interesting. very heavy accent but you'll get used to it. go to each class and don't skip out!,0
Mr. Caldwell went through math problems way too fast and got irritated if you stopped him with a question.  Majority of the class was frusterated with this teacher.  Did not pass his class... took same class from another teacher in the summer and got an A... Figure that problem out Mr. Caldwell!,0
"I had Dr. Longworth for her 2nd semester teaching and it really showed. She seemed unsure of herself a lot throughout the lectures, but she got better as the semester wore on. The exams are heavily curved (the top 50% of the class gets at least a B). You must read if you want an A and you need to understand the concepts along w/ the physics.",1
Very nice and caring teacher and person. She will go out of her way to help you with personal problems or school problems. NUMBER 1.,1
"Professor Maynard is a pretty dry as a professor. She is not very flexible with assignments, projects etc. She knows what shes talking about but cannot easily relate to students. Lots of reading. No textbook since its online.",0
He is a nice and funny guy but I would not take him again. He acts like he offers so much help but really doesn't. You really need to know your stuff to pass this class.,0
I love Prof. Willmore! She is the best professor you can get for a foreign language. She is very very helpful and clear in instructions and what she expects from you. Her teaching style is awesome. She speaks in English and Spanish so it's never confusing or frustrating. Lots of homework on cengage but it's not that hard.,1
"Mr. Solmon is a good professor. Show up early for class, he closes the door at the time class is supposed to start. Do your work and pay attention. He is a very intelligent man and is willing to help if you show that you care. I am taking him for MATH 1830 next semester.",1
"Very nice guy, but not good at teaching a class. He is more of a working guy instead of a professor. You can't understand him. As well as he doesn't really tell you what the class points are. As well as not giving you your grades.  I wouldn't recommend taking him, try to get a different teacher.",0
"Good professor, helpful, accessible and generally cares about you. Go to the office hours like the other student said. Tests and quizzes are straight off text / class - but you have to do the work - but you'll learn a lot. Prof is pretty cool actually.  Class is recommended and prof is good overall...",1
Absolutely AWFUL professor. I have no idea how she still has a job. All she does is put her students down because we're not experts in microbiology. Lecture is pointless because you have to read the book if you wanna pass her exams which are extremely difficult. She is very condescending and no help at all. Do well in lab and you'll pass,0
arrogant,0
"Professor McClay is one of the best teacher I have ever taken. She is willing to help you as long as you ask! Come and be on time for her class, study her power points, read the book and you will do great!",1
Profesor McCarthy is a very nice but I would not recommend taking her class! She is an extremely tough grader and will not give out an A. I am an A student and I got a C on my first paper. She allows you to correct your paper which is helpful. You are given 3 papers but she just expects way too much. Assignments are unclear.,0
Worst teacher ever. does not teach or help you. highly recommend a different teacher,0
Professor Valltos is awesome. His lectures are engaging and extremely interesting. He does an excellent job using real-life scenarios to explain class material. He's comical and tells it like it is. I would definitely take another class with this professor.,1
"Great professor.  Kind, attentive, thorough.  He teaches some amazing skills and you overcome speech anxiety at the same time.  I'm looking for other classes that he teaches.",1
A very friendly and approachable teacher. This class for some reason made me fall asleep cause it was mostly common sense discussion about diplomacy. Exams are easy as he gives you a choice to pick 2/3 out of 7 questions. It's basically one question from each week of the semester. Just study three of the topics really thoroughly and you got an A.,1
"I had Dr. Tarner for an online psyc 101 class. As long as you read the book and do the work assigned to you, you can be guaranteed an A. I even had some answers that she marked wrong but when I explained them, she gave me my points back without hesitation. She's very nice and willing to answer any questions, and emails back relatively quickly.",1
Scott is my favourite teacher from Seneca. You can tell he has fun teaching his class and is very respectful of his students. All he wants is for students to attend class and to participate. He ensures that his classes are safe environments and helps students get out of their shells. As long as you show you're making the effort you will pass.,1
"Dr. K. is one of the best professors I've had at FGCU. I had her for a graduate class which is less formal than undergrad. The class was not all out of the book, but more life experiences and her past experiences. She is very knowledgeable and experienced in her area. She is very helpful outside the class as well.",1
Do not take this professor under any circumstances. For some reason she believes her students should dedicate most of their time to her class despite it being a Miami plan class for most. The tests are filled with ambiguously worded questions which cause averages in the high 60's and essays are expected throughout the semester. Do not take her.,0
"On numerous occasions I have emailed her with no reply. Her syllabus doesn't match what she says in class. We have to watch dumb movies and answer things like ""What repetitions do you notice?"". I'm not even sure what that means. We also have to write 500 words a week on absolutely nothing. She's very nice but her assignments are ridiculous.",0
This is by far my favorite French class! Her classes are always entertaining and she has some REALLY funny stories! This class will also help you develop your French exponentially! We write stories -not papers- and there are weekly quizzes that are rather easy if you study for a few minutes. I would definitely recommend taking this class!,1
"Was a decent prof, however, was very easily distracted during lectures.  Says ""Um"" alot which can be annoying.  Moderate effort will get you a B.  Labs are an easy A if your TA is not a tightwad. Homework is an easy A if you know how to use Google.  Tests require synthesis of knowledge, not discussion of knowledge taught in class.",0
"He is terrible at explaining concepts and he does not prepare for his tests which are extremely difficult. He is available for office hours, but he lets all students into the room so that it is really hard to get your question across.",0
"Very hard to hear and understand in class. Gives you the option to view the course online instead of in class, which is nice. Homework is not turned in or graded, so its only tests and quizzes for your grade. Homework does not match what is talked about during lecture. Seems to be more of an into to using Excel course",0
Non responsive to emails or outside help. Does not follow her own syllabus. Extremely test heavy with 100+ questions each.,0
I couldn't imagine a more self-congratulatory professor. How could you screw up craft of fiction? Use it as your podium/back-slap/let me tell you about me and the writing process therapy session.,0
"She talks for ever in class about the most abstract stuff. Approximately 5 minutes of what she goes over in lecture is on the exams. Inconsistent af, late all the time, exam is 100% based off the book, and you only get a study guide if you're lucky. Never grades things on time. Comes off as super nice, funny, etc. but a bad professor.",0
"Singleminded, not helpful, poor presentation, has huge favorites/dislikes",0
"The group progect was a nightmare. JP decided to be a ""bad customer"" on purpose and make it as hard as possible for everyone to get it done. His tests are also much harder than they need to be. Be prepared to bring every slide he uses on your notes, maybe you'll get a good score then.",0
"I graduated over a decade ago, but Pearson's cruelty stuck with me. He seemed to think he was some sort of revolutionary acting teacher by being such a jerk with students, but really he was just rude, condescending, and on a power trip. I missed my grandpa's funeral because of him. That pretty much sums it up.",0
Dr. Batman is usually confused and unable to write out the answer to his own problem because he forgets steps or starts over three or four times. He really needs a wake-up call because he is failing to get students engaged because they do not understand the material.,0
"Chris is the nicest guy you'll meet. Problem is, he has no idea how to teach and no idea how to get the right words across to you. You can't just sit and listen to him. If you want to get anything from his lectures, you have to pay extra close attention, think a little bit, and ask lots and lots of questions.",0
"Professor Logue updated her announcements regularly, gave good feedback, and was helpful. The only con was that it took her quite long to update grades. Other than that, as long as you take the time to study, complete the course work on time, and ask questions, then you should do fine in her course.  I would definitely take Professor Logue again!",1
"She is the most disorganized professor I have taken in my undergrad education. This means that assignments don't make sense, but she still gives them out like anything. With that, she still is the toughest grader who won't give you any margin for error even though the assignments themselves have so many errors in them. Worst professor...",0
Very difficult class. Exams are super difficult. Proffesor goes through work at a very fast pace.  She gets upset if you ask question. She knows her topic very well but assumes the class does too. Shes is very nice and friendly but doesnt clarify her work very well.,0
"Nothing. Not only did she give me attitude on the first day of the semester, but also falsely accused me and a classmate who is also my best friend of cheating on an exam, by asking us what's up about our scantrons in front of the entire class. I have never felt so humiliated and disrespected by anybody like this ever.",0
"The class is an intellectual joke. Take home exams and everybody cheats. If you want to ""get over"" this is the class for you. but it really is an insult to college.",0
"Must attend classes, but lectures don't help much as he reads off a Powerpoint. Ignore him and read the textbook. Overall not a good teacher; he gets angry when you ask questions and his attempt to answer math- related questions only causes more confusion. Avoid if you can",0
"Took his class for 131 & barely passed. Idk why I decided to take him for college Algebra ,its useless because he teaches you his way and expects you to know all the formulas already. He makes fun of the students and rants in class instead of doing lectures. He gives very few test thats why I took his class but he doesnt curve grades. Hes awful!",0
"(online course)Really good communication, lots of projects but easy class overall",1
"Put simply, CAPT Felker is the most realistic instructor I have ever had. He is tough on essays and papers but he gives open notes and book essay assessments with plenty of time and information to prepare. CAPT Felker hammers the fact he cares more about ProDev than he does grading and he will make sure his class has fair realistic expectations.",1
Amazing teacher. Funny and reasonable expectations!,1
He is SUPER easy. Doesnt provide any extra credit anymore. His attitude is what I dreaded in this class but it you want an essay A TAKE HIM. Attendance only matters on presentation days.,0
"Will confirm your figures for your essays, goes to answer the exact same question but it's a different group and he'll say that it's absolutely wrong. Doesn't know what he wants. Has said ""i dont care"" and ""do better"" when people come to him for help. 80% of his neuro class have F's. Dont take him. You've been warned.",0
"Wonderful professor. She's so caring for her students, gives great feedback and is a respectable human being. Project heavy class but, you learn so much and sometimes it doesn't seem like work. Use of textbook is very minimal because you go directly into projects in week 3. Great class!",1
"Took him for Chem 1. I thought he was great, his lectures were very organized and he made hard stuff like stoichiometry easy to understand. But I have heard that he is less lenient on Chem 2 students he even said he expects you to know nomenclatures in Chem 2. Just study his lecture powerpoints and practice his practice tests!!",1
"This class requires you to teach yourself. Make friends, do the homework, make sure you know the content, you'll be good. The online material is MUCH easier than the lecture ones. I have friends who took the lecture, and honestly the online version is way easier. Given that its a 400-level class, it won't be a breeze. Put in the work * you'll be ok",0
"Best professor, easy A, easy class. I would suggest seating close to the front, screen and letter are small",1
"She was very helpful. You need to do a lot of work in her class on your own, but thats math. I suggest going through each section before class the day of or night before. Do homework to get ready for quizzes and if you are doing well on quizzes exams go well and are really easy. Exams are major for points but have 10% worth of extra credit on them",1
"As other said, and at this time I have to add, even in an online class, be ready for this teacher to go off topic, very unorganized, shares too much of her private life. I will say if the class were face to face she would have been talking about her life all day long. No offense but may be it is time to stay home and enjoy your family.",0
This class should be a 200 level or below class just based on the curriculum and how every assignment in this class is a step by step walk through. It was very apparent that he had no real world experience on this topic and there were quite a few things taught that were false. An example: apparently a web application firewall can stop 0-day attacks,0
"He assumed that we had learned more in previous courses than we actually had.  AP Style was expected to be used on his homeworks; however, many people in the class don't know AP Style because they haven't had JN 311. His grading scale was weird. Homework is worth more than the group project. Awkward silences were commonplace in his class.",0
"I had Mazamit for Cultures & Contexts: Modern Israel. The material of the class was interesting, but I have to say Mazalit made the experience during this class beyond miserable for various I found her to be extremely difficult to follow up with during office hours . Her grading was confusing and shes rude when confronted about a grade.",0
"Professor Clinton is a really great guy and undoubtedly knows the subjects he teaches. However, he claims to be accessible outside of class and willing to work with students, but I didn't find that to be the case necessarily. The course schedule was mostly unpredictable, and the final ended up being like 8 times longer than any other assignment.",0
"Decent professor, sends all assignments and answer keys by e-mail, but mostly mirrors the textbook and doesn't speak loud enough during lectures",1
She is an awesome teacher and I would take her for every English class if I could.  She makes sure that you understand everything before you take that final exam.,1
Funny and understanding will work with you if you need the help love to take again,1
"Dr. Day is the WORST professor I've had so far! If you skip lecture, you are guarunteed to loose points because attendance and pop quizzes count toward your grade. Also, he teaches as if everyone has a strong background in coding (despite being an INTRO class). If you don't have experience coding, you will most likely struggle in labs.",0
"Lori was a mess of a professor. Rude, arrogant, and all over the place quite honestly. The class taught themselves each chapter every week and she completely could care less about the stuff being taught. As a matter of fact - she never taught once. Also, twice a week meeting class only met once a week, forcing tighter deadlines.",0
"Tax II is a hard course as it is. When you have someone who degrades the class and unwilling to answer questions, the course becomes next to impossible to get through. Daria goes through few problems in class SLOWLY. Practice the problems weekly - the only way you will pass. Stay on top of course work. Take AFA 817 with another prof if possible.",0
"Overall he is an okay teacher. He is somewhat unwilling to provide help to students, and he talks down to students. However, if you miss class everything is online. Personally, I have not enjoyed him as a professor.",0
The absolute worst. Take anyone but him trust me,0
"she's nice but not sexy...but looks arent everything. She is very open minded...and helpful...but she made me raise my hand for too long...that cheesed me (that means she got me mad for those who don't understand)
 
 One",1
"Part time  professor and he has own business during daytime. he just graduated from school only few years, it is almost impossible to reach him outside of the class. doesn't reply email until last minute, text message either. his project and assignments are unclear sometimes. if you take his class, ask him questions right after class.",0
"McCormick is one of the hardest teachers in the Nursing program. I also had her for patho and almost failed both patho and med/surg. Her test questions are hard and confusing, so make sure you do practice questions. She probably won't remember your name if you go to her for help, but you might be able to argue a test question.",0
"I have had her for 2 classes now and want to take as many as possible with her. She is a great professor, really knows her topics. She is very approachable and always willing to help students. Her classes are interesting, but you must put in a good amount of effort to get  an A",1
"lectures were very clear. He only tests on what was covered in class, but you must understand everything to do well.",1
Very nice guy. But worst math teacher I have ever had. If you don't show up you will not pass. There are no video lectures so if you miss class then you don't know what we did on that day. If you are not confident in math then do not take this class. He doesn't explain the material clearly at all and if you ask questions he gets annoyed.,0
Possibly the most boring and terrible teacher i've ever had. He jumps around on the subject everywhere to where his lectures make no sense at all. Then somedays he'll be in a terrible mood. I always used my phone for a bible and he had no problem with it at all. Then one day he just told me to get out cause he didn't like cell phones.,0
"Every poor review you read about Dr. Kovach is true and I cannot stress enough that no one is exaggerating. His labs were unclear as he didn't give thorough explanations. Remote learning in his class consisted of weekly ""quizzes"", which always had 38+ questions and we really only had the book to study from because his Powerpoints were so vague.",0
"He is a good prof and he is very passionate about the subject, the Baby Human series he showed in the class was hilarious. The assigned reading was too long and I think the TA was not fair in grading the papers, I almost spent 30 hours on the last paper and got a B-! I guess he is not going to teach any classes any more.",0
"Stay away from this class!!! He expects you to be a genius and teaches the class like we're PhD students. Like bro, how do you expect me to prove all of calculus in a one hour test?!?!?",0
Took walker for summer session and I regret not taking a full semester with him. He is a really awesome speech teacher and I recommend anyone to take speech with him. Every class met is really fun you'll never be bored once especially with his random fun speeches he does. ,1
"Took calculus in high school and did very well, but Coop's approach to teaching isn't very helpful. Write down his in class examples, but try to read the book for further understanding",0
"Amazing professor. Make sure to do all the reading and take notes during the lectures. The individual portion of the main group project for the class I took (ARTH 2753) was very stressful and difficult, but if you seek the right guidance and work hard in the class its possible to get an A. Great lecturer and great course!",1
"She was the worse prof. I already didn't like Chem. is high school and good thing I learn most of it there because she made things so much more confusing. You have to memorize everything, she doesn't let have have forumals for the test, make sure you remeber them or your test grade will be really bad!",0
"Im doing well in his class, but ONLY BECAUSE I TAUGHT MYSELF EVERYTHING! If you want a class with a professsor who writes equations and does not answer questions NOR explains how to apply equations, this is the one for you! If you can avoid taking him, do it at all costs, especially if you cant teach yourself this stuff. I",0
"Dr. Viriasova is very clear with what she wants. The amount of papers is daunting, but (I can't stress this enough) go see her during her office hours. If she knows that you're putting in the effort and want to succeed she will help you succeed. Even if that means writing papers early, it will pay off. Her extra credit assignments definitely help!",1
"The word I'd choose to describe this professor is 'rough.' I had such a hard time learning from him in class and in office hours. He doesn't connect to people well and doesn't try to teach things in different ways. If you have him, read the book and good luck.",0
Professor Kroll is great! His lectures are very easy to follow and as long as you take the notes and study you should pass. He usually has one homework and one a quiz a week which is great for grade boosters so just make sure you study for those. Also go to his office hours and he will help with anything you don't get!,1
"Professor Zeoli is a great math teacher overall. She conveys the subject matter very clearly when teaching so that the student understands it. Also, the way her Foundations of mathematics class is set up sets up the student for success according to me getting an A in her class. I'm very satisfied with her MA103 class and teaching ability.",1
"I took national government with this professor and I can honestly say the people giving poor reviews are mainly doing so based on their grade. His lectures are filled with tons of information- get ready to pay attention. If you don't go to lecture, don't expect to get an A+. He's not bad to listen to, and his lectures tend to be semi interesting",1
i took him last year and i have never had a better teacher since. him and i always had great school related conversations and he never ceased to help me out. i would recommend this teacher for anyone!,1
"Arevelo is a terrible teacher. She has a very heavy accent which makes it difficult to understand her lecture, as well as making it easy to loose focus and interest. If you have to miss an exam the only time you can make it up is 2 days before the final(she will not budge with this even if you have a good reason). Test are very hard. DO NOT TAKE!",0
He's a great guy that wants student to pass and succeed,1
"The class isnt easy but Jozsef is a great instructor. He wants you to learn to understand, not just memorize to test. His tests arent necessarily easy - a LOT of essay style questions - but if you put in the effort youll do well. Find a study buddy or form a group to make sure you understand and can explain concepts correctly. Record lectures!",1
This is probably my favorite class to go to this semester. I did not enjoy calc at all in high school but she makes everything so easy to understand. She is very knowledgeable and cares about creating relationships with students. She explains things clearly and will take the time to go over any questions that we have. Love taking her class!,1
I read great things about him but just pray you dont have a family crisis or you will be ignored and dropped. He had the audacity to ask if I was still enrolled in his class when I was out dealing with covid and deaths in the family. Other professors were willing to help and even extended due time for work so I can complete the class but not Ric,0
"she takes off points for no reason and doesn't teach her class, she makes her students do it",0
"This class was really interesting and great for people who may not be interested by most history classes. Show up to every class, do the readings, and submit your work on time, and you should succeed in this class while also enjoying it! Sigal is a great professor and guy - would definitely recommend this course!",1
Here is all you need to know. He is NOT a good teacher and will not respond to emails or calls. He WILL give you the TEST as a study guide the week before. You are dumb if you don't get an A in this class.,0
Class is interesting she makes it entertaining. Lectures do consist of thing learned before but it is very helpful and refreshes your memory. If you do your work you will pass the class pretty simple. She gives extra credit all the time which could help you boost your grade if you've missed any assignments.,1
"I loved this online course! You constantly need to check canvas and know how to use the internet and you'll be good. He has due dates determined since beginning of course. RENT the book, you depend on it! Its not hard reading, its actually interesting. Just make sure not to slack on reading, i highly recommend making time. Its a great course!",1
"Professor Endlich was definitely my favorite teacher this semester. She is such a caring person and funny. She tries her hardest for us to have a good time in her class, and tries to make work as easy as possible. She understands everything that you are going through. I would definitely take her again, and not even think about it twice.",1
"Awesome prof. Extremely entertaining, fair grading, great guy- definitely recommend him.  I wasn't looking forward to the class, and it ended up being my favorite.",1
"Denise is very passive-aggressive. When she doesn't like something, instead of talking to you about it, she gets serious and rude. She gives a lot of criticism but never any praise. She expects you to be perfect at all that you do, and she says she's willing to help if you need it, but she never replies to her emails or texts. Contradictive :-/",0
"This is my 2nd time taking this course & yet again, I am on the verge of failing. Looking at past comments, I have no idea why he hasn't been fired yet! He is rude & refuses to help. I went to his office hours & it was like he wanted nothing to do with me. 66 years old. Why hasn't he retired yet? HE NEEDS FIRED!",0
"Her class is easy, but it generally seems like she doesn't want to be there. Not a bad teacher by any means, but she's certainly hands-off and leaves us to our own devices.",0
"I love her, she loves us and inspires us to be a better person! I am an international student and have learned so much from her. If you do need a class that will help you with your writing and change your life, this is your a must-option!",1
"Super nice guy, pretty funny too. Only three essays throughout the semester and if you show him that you are trying, you will easily get a 4.0.",1
"Professor Simerka is a very intelligent person. She really knows her stuff and is a huge intellectual. Nevertheless, her grading style is too harsh and the subject matter was a little dry. Although she is good at making you feel insufficient, she does care about her students and is always willing to make the time to meet one on one to discuss grade",1
Excellent teacher.  I learned a lot this semester!  If you do the homework and go to class you will get no worse than a B.  She answers all questions and looks good too!,1
Very nice prof! Cares about your learning a lot!,1
"this professor is not bad just doesnt answer ?s clearly and makes you feel stupid sometimes for asking even when she says do you have any ?s. also after emailing her my work to check for accuracy she still took points off. so ask her to check entire hw. if you read the book,do the hw and show up, easy A. ps: know how to use excel b4 taking class.",1
She is not a good teacher.  I would not recommend anyone to take her class.  She does not related well with her students.,0
"Pointless class, lectures are boring.  The teacher doesn't seem motivated to teach the class.",0
"This professor is definitely the ideal English professor. She gives a minimal amount of homework but expects a lot from your essays. Her textbook ""They Say, I Say"" will definitely guide you to your success not only in this class but in your upcoming future as well. There are no tests and quizzes but attendance is mandatory.",1
He is rude and harsh; very negative,0
Never graded any work so the last week of class I have no idea where my grade stood. Posted a test without telling anyone what book we were suppose to have . Also posted assignments 3 days into the week.,0
"Dr. Bailey is hands down the best professor in the CBE department at CSU. He is compassionate, brilliant, and funny. Makes you think really hard about stuff, but is always there to help you clear things up and help you excel! I've had him for 2 courses now and he is consistent in all aspects regardless of the level of the course. Great professor.",1
I can't begin to express how much I loved Grant! The material is interesting and his exams are based off of his powerpoints. It really is NOT a hard class. There's one group project and it's not very difficult. Tests will be easy if you go over the powerpoints. He's so nice and funny; one of the best professors I've ever had! Would take again.,1
Hertz is the man. 10/10 would recommend.,1
Boring! Listening to him lecture is one of the hardest things I've ever had to do. He's unclear about what he wants on tests and assignments and he doesn't have facial expressions which is kinda disconcerting.,0
"I took his online class and I would NOT recommend taking it unless you enjoy suffering. He only allows 5 mins for each quiz. FIVE MINUTES with 10 -15 questions. Online video lectures were very long (2-3 hours). The test itself was easy since we had MORE time than 5 minutes ! His class is easy, just be prepared for literally short times quizzes.",0
"very monotone. lots of homework. do good on final and all test grades are replaced. online quizzes are easy, homework is difficult. curves all tests including final. attendance isn't part of grade but essential to succeed. take him! he wants you to pass the class",1
"One of the best teachers I've ever had.  Do the work, and you'll be rewarded.  Use your brain, you'll be rewarded further.  He doesn't have time for those who slack off, and will tell you so. Great preparation for actual employment as a legal researcher.  Wish I had more classes I could take from him.",1
"DO NOT TAKE SENSATION AND PERCEPTION. YOU WILL REGRET!!! hes a cool dude, but theres only three tests and thats the only grades you receive. The tests are almost impossible to pass, so if you're willing to focus all your attentionwork on this ELECTIVE, take this class.",0
I absolutely love this man. He makes you understand what he is talking about and tries to make it interesting!! Take him if possible!!,1
"This class was VERY HARD. I got a D on every test. I am typically an A student and was at risk of failing. He does curve the class but it is still hard. For someone who is not a science major, I would not recommend this class. I feel he lectured on unnecessary information and test questions were random. Extra credit given at end if needed.",0
"Hes the worst teacher Ive ever had in any subject. And I graduated years ago. Trust all the bad things people are saying. They are not just disgruntled students, I personally aced his classes. Hes just not a good person.",0
"This class is such a good class if you are interested in film. Not an easy A but its not impossible just expect work. Brent knows SO much about film and is a really good teacher. You will have homework every week but most often it is enjoyable plus 2 big papers. You watch lots of clips and a few films expect to participate, he will make/call you.",1
"I really don't understand why this professor makes this class so difficult. I feel like he doesn't proof read his assignments, but yet he published a book. He gives very terrible feedback and it doesn't make any sense. Plus, he takes off points if you don't have the specific answers he wants, even though he gives a very basic and vague question.",0
Very easy class if you do the work assigned. You will never stay the full class. He lets you out early every time. Expect to go to class to write the essay and then leave. You will love his class.,1
"Show up to class, ask questions, and if you need her to be in the math lab she will go and help you! Make sure you study. As long as you do the work and show up you'll be ok. She offers retests and gives take home quizzes. Not the worst teacher like many people say. You need the textbook for hw.",1
"This course is a hybrid course, meaning that its a class you go to to simply do work online. MyMathLab helps a lot in refreshing your memory on past techniques and the professor is always there to help. However, he makes it clear that he doesnt teach the material.",1
"I have mixed feelings about Professor Horan. I loved him up until finales week. It's an easy class as long as you turn in the assignments, but I ended up having technical difficulties near the end and almost failed because he wouldn't be understanding so-- ehhh. Overall liked him more then I didn't.",1
"For both Macro and Micro, this class is fairly simple to succeed in. Mr. Daigle does lecture a fair amount, but if you attend class and take notes on the facts he provides you will be successful. This class requires you study your notes and text but if you are willing to put in the work then you will succeed and learn in this class",1
"This was the hardest gen ed I have ever taken. The test were difficult, and the writing we have to do is graded very harshly. His lectures are very interesting and it shows he loves what he teaches but the work that we have to do in that class is horrible. 3 test that over a handful of people failed? That should not happen in a gen ed",0
"Honestly one of the best professors I have had at SJSU. He knows what he is talking about. Clear when it comes to exams and quizzes no trick questions. You have to show up to class for his lecture. Is willing to help you with any questions you have after class or during office hours. 2 midterms, 1 excel project and 1 final exam.",1
"Thankfully he sticks to the syllabus day by day. NO use of mathlab, all of our book homework looked like (1-89) EOO (every other odd). He doesn't check for accuracy on the homework. There are few quizzes and although the 3 exams are tough, you can 'correct' them and get hella credit back. If you just read the book and do HW its a simple B/B+.",0
"Very nice and friendly, obviously knows her work but assumes the class does too. She rushes through everything she teaches and expects the class to understand. Gets frustrated if you ask questions during class. Very very difficult exams,  they are super long and you never have enough time to finish. Shes good with office hours but thats it.",0
Hard considering its supposed to be an intro course.,1
Professor Khajavipour is very caring towards his students but at times he can be slightly scatterbrained. Many people in my class complained about not having their grades up to date in a timely manner and as of now I still haven't received a final grade in the course. Reading questions are VERY tedious and most weeks they aren't worth 15 points.,0
The guy doesn't teach whatsoever. He tells you he's on your side but that's a load of.... Instead of teaching you the material he talks about how bad professors are nowadays when hes the worst of them all. His exams are really hard and the fact that you have to teach yourself doesn't help.,0
"AMAZZZIIINNNGGG...debra is the nicest lady you will ever meet. Although we didnt learn that much, we got to know all the people in our class very well. She made the class fun and we did a lot of group activities.",1
"Hands down the best if not one of the best professors I've ever had. I've been in college for about 5 years now, and Mike has every single quality a teacher needs to have. I wish he taught more classes because if I could I'd fill my entire schedule with Mike as my instructor.",1
I just loved this woman i had to take her class twice. Actually i failed the first time but it was so great i was able to take it over with her.,1
"Absolutely useless online course.  Most of the online resource links don't work, the assignments are posted late but still expected to be on time, and there is no organization.  We went from saying ""Hello, my name is..."" in Week 3 to being expected to introduce ourselves and someone else in a paragraph of French with no lead-in.  Just terrible.",0
Can an accreditor please sit through this course and give me my money back? At least look at the homework assignments he gave us. He never taught us Verilog but all of the homework assignments were poorly worded (if worded at all) copies of homework from more advanced courses at other universities. Most people failed but still got grades...,0
Worst professor ever. No one should ever take him. Couldn't teach to save his life. He doesn't even know how to use the technology at hand ie basic computer or projector. Only teaches for him to understand and no one else. Avoid like the plague. If you have no choice get outside help asap.,0
"He does not communicate no matter how many times you email him. He will also give you points off but not tell you why and tell you your essay was written well. Very unorganized, not clear when things are due.",0
"Took this class online, so never met in person, but seems easy-going. He is easy to get hold of when needed, but made a few mistakes on grading, but he did correct them when brought to his attention. Stayed behind the entire semester on grading. Didn't give much feedback, so hard to know what to improve on. Pretty easy class. Not a heavy load.",1
"Wonderful teacher. Explains thoroughly, and really cares for her students! She's never mean and always puts her students first. Her teaching style works for many of her students and I was really thankful, I got lucky with a great teacher like her! Also she has a huge heart and rarely thinks of herself!",1
"He is very nice and easygoing, but has a heavy accent (Chinese?) and can be difficult to understand. Also, he is not helpful when you don't understand a concept and need to ask questions.. All things considered, I would not recommend him. I had to heavily rely on my book to learn in this class.",0
"Sincerely hope no-one ever has to get this prof ever again. He is quite possibly the worst I have ever encountered.  Refuses to actually help students, belittles students, and is very sarcastic.  He should, without question, be fired.",0
"Professor Sbragia is an amazing lecturer and really showcases his love for the material. He is both funny and made a one and a half hour class fly by. The essays had very clear criteria and the tests, although having a strange format, was incredibly easy to prepare for thanks to the in-depth study guides provided.",1
"I like Dr. Wells as a person but never have I studied so hard for a class and FLUNK 2 out of the 3 exams. The tests are EXTREMELY difficult. He ""tells"" you what to study but much of what he says isn't on the test per se. SHOW ALL YOUR WORK on practical problems. Even if you don't know how to solve it, the more you show, the more credit you'll get.",0
I took her classes whenever I could! One of the best professors at SSU! Overheads are the best!,1
"This professor made one semester for me at Northeastern a living Hell. Easy enough class, but my experience with him was one of the worst in my academic career. Do not take a class with this professor f you are a working student or require flexibility with your deadlines/workload . 0/10.",0
Best prof ive had so far at nyit. I took him last year spring && enjoyed him very much. I wish he taught every subject. Hes hilarious and a great teacher. He can make a caveman understand tmat lol,1
"Relatively easy professor, as long as you attend class everyday and do ALL the work (LONG reading assignments, 15pg single spaced papers, etc) Absolutely does not like people who skip class. Also expects students to do some outside research on reading assignments without being asked. Once you figure out what she wants, her course is fairly easy.",1
"Run far away! Although Dr. Simerka is incredibly intelligent, she's very impersonal and her manner can seem very snobbish. This class was really not a great choice. The material is dry and class discussion can also be dry. Incredibly harsh grader, but also good because she expects you to work to your utmost potential.",0
"She is not helpful at all, write down everything she says in class. Only three exams(fair if you go to class, review the power points, and read the textbook), two papers(hard), and 2 easy online posts each week. DRONES on and on and laughs after everything she says. If you go to office hours, she just repeats what she said in class. Not caring.",0
"Dr. Watts is a very kind, passionate professor who wants students to develop and advance their writing skills. It was a joy to take her class. She introduced interesting lecture topics and encouraged classroom discussions.",1
"gosh, everything people have said was right, i had him his last semester here, class started with 35 ended with 13, the rest withdrew, i was one of them, if that tells you anything about how terrible of a teacher he was, thank god hes gone.",0
"His classes are very informative and interactive. Unless you have the time to really stick to the text book and lectures, you'll have a really hard time in his class. He is a really hard marker and has very specific expectations for his assignments. Be prepared to receive lower marks than you expected. I would not take a class with him again.",0
"Worst Professor I have ever had.  I got an A- in his class but had to study every single day.  After taking final, I couldn't sleep for 4 days until I received my grade because the final was so incredibly hard.  Everyone came out of the final traumatized.  Unfortunately, CCNY makes this course very hard to pass no matter which professor you take.",0
Thad loves what he does and it shoes in the way he teaches. He is very helpful and always willing to stick around after class to help. I wish Butte had more instructors like him,1
"Took this class in the online synchronous format, but going to lectures was useless. Read straight off the PowerPoints he gave us. I read every textbook chapter and did all his practice questions, but then didn't do great on his tests. Don't recommend taking this course with this professor.",0
"I took his graduate digital communication systems course. He's a hard professor without a doubt, but he tosses in little jokes, which i enjoyed. you MUST do homework to understand the class. he's very friendly and approachable. he does give BIG curves as well for final grades.",1
"I really did not like this class. I use to love history, but after this class I dont know if i'll ever take another history class at oregon. She says if you know the answers to the questions in the beginning of her lecture slides you'll be fine but her questions are super broad and on the test they are very very specific.",0
"I really liked Tim-sensei, he's a great professor, and he knows how to teach Japanese very well.",1
He teaches very well just show up and take notes and you should have no problems. He will give you everything you need to know in class,1
Exams were worth 70% of your total grades. Talked and talked and talked during lecture and didnt stop to explain anything. Played favoritism with specific students and would tell them different things regarding exams in office hours. Graded free response exams very odd.,0
She uses inappropriate examples in class and tries to push her political beliefs on students while teaching totally unrelated topics. This is very distracting and unprofessional.,0
Super great teacher. Her tests are just testing if you understand the ideas nothing really there to trick you. She is super nice and the lecture is not too bad. As long as you go to the class and pay attention you should easily get an A on every exam.,1
"If you have a family emergency and don't notify her ahead of time, (you know, because those things are under ""your control""), she'll lower your grade 22%. She changes the syllabus a lot, gives a lot of articles to read, briefly discusses articles, puts mostly videos in class, and her class meetings are unpredictable for a hybrid class.",0
"The course pack was abysmal, it had incomplete texts and pages that were incomplete as a sticky-note was left on the page. The majority of the semester was spent listening to presentations of a high school level on artists and art movement or a philosophy. Where was the teaching?! Oh that's right, we watched movies on the Greek & Romans & a church.",0
"Super funny professor with great lectures! Tests are easy! You will notice something in common with complainers, they don't go to the lectures or don't watch them online. If you watch the lectures and READ the book, you will get an A on the online, open book, open notes test. This is the easiest class, I've ever done at MDC. Take him!",1
"So inspirational, great teaching skills. ",1
"Amazing teacher! Muvhill is funny and crazy. He brings his own life experiences to class making the material fun and easy. There is never a dull moment. We take quizzes for every chapter online, one paper and a final which is a combo of all the quizzes. Just pay attention review your notes and you'll pass.",1
Hope youre not wanting to take this class in the morning because there is a 99% chance of falling asleep. To this day I still dont understand why attendance was mandatory considering absolutely nothing from what she calls lectures was important or helpful towards class work or assignments. Best of luck but I would not reccomend this class.,0
"Great and reasonable man if you show genuine effort. Attendance is mandatory and there is homework every night. If you do the work and show an interest, youll achieve the grade you deserve.",1
"Her teaching skills is really not all that, but she's really lenient if she sees you work hard in her class. Make sure your lab notebook is extremely informational because that might just save you. Also do the extra credit reading as well even though it's 1%, might seem little but it just might save your grade, trust me it's from experience.",1
"Dr Miller wasn't very helpful in lab for 241, but was very helpful in 242. If you ask him for help, he always will. We did a lot of peer teaching, he IS listening, and will correct you when wrong. I think he expects you to be able to think for yourself by the time you get to a 200 level class. Don't forget: C6H12O6+6O2+6H2O+6CO2+ATP",1
"This was my third time have Professor Williams. I knew what to expect in his class. SF 341 was my favorite class. I recommend it. You learn about Airport Management, Airport Security, Airport Safety, Airport Inspections, How to run the Airport, and most importantly keep the Airport Safe. If you take this class, study! study!! study!!! Always helps!",1
"So starting off, this professor is a very sweet guy, but his accent and the way he goes about teaching is definitely difficult. the Wiley math homework consisted of things that we never went over, and I just had trouble overall in the class, when I never had problems in calc before.",0
"Ratana is a pretty awful instructor who can struggles to explain the most basic concepts of operating systems. He recycles assignments, quizzes, and tests, and he teaches this class pretty often, so it shouldn't be difficult to find resources from previous semesters. ",0
"She is the worst. She only has 3 tests, including the final. She takes off so many points if you don't do exactly what she wants but she doesn't even say what she wants. She didn't assign any work and then in the last 3 weeks she made 3 projects due. She just talks for the full hour and 15 minutes.",0
"Run the other way! This teacher is insane. She is an extremely hard grader and the only way to do good on a paper is to buy one offline from someone with their masters. I couldn't wait for this class to be over. Nice person, but a pain as a teacher.",0
"I love this man. So helpful and incredibly sweet. Once you take his intelligence as adorably awkward instead of superficial, you'll appreciate his teaching so much more. You actually learn how to use the book you spent so much money on and use those skills for other classes. And his sense of humor is priceless!",1
"Would not recommend taking. I ended up dropping the course due to the harsh grading. I received a 0 on a 2,000 word essay because my sources were not in alphabetical order. She is nice but the grading is horrible.",0
She is a sweet lady to your face but when she returns assignments it is as if she is Dr. Jekyl/Mr. Hyde. She is not clear about what she wants and then takes off alot of points when its not up to her standards. Take her if you want to work your butt off and still get a bad grade.She is one of the toughest graders in the nursing program. BEWARE!,0
Boring but good professor. He sends you the notes over everything on your email.,1
"Nice professor, she rally cares about you learning finance. She goes over all the exams the class before and gives very little work outside of class.",1
"I took Crim. Pro. with Raphael after being warned by some of his Constitutional Law students that he was bad. HE WAS AWESOME. If you do the readings, it's not hard at all. He will call on you, but if you don't know the answer, he won't ridicule you or make you feel bad, he'll just move on. If you engage him, he's interesting and fun. I recommend.",1
He doesn't do much lectures and he gives short examples but most of the time he missed an example that we see in homework that we were not taught yet. It's very confusing but if you study hard and you'll pass the class & tests just fine. He does one day in computer lab to assist you on your homeworks and does other day in a classroom for lectures.,0
"Provided online lectures during the pandemic, but they were extremely long and forced you to remember a lot. Only get one attempt for homework. Gives you a study guide, but pulls the ""not everything will be on the test"" card. Unrealistic student expectations and difficulty, especially for a low 300 level class.",0
"CBE 350 was overall a very interesting and useful class, and I felt that Dr. Trinh explained concepts well. However, the tests and homework are ridiculously difficult (test averages in the 50s). He also doesnt give a grading scale in the syllabus so you wont know how well youre doing until the class is over.",0
"Mostly do-your own work, 3 hr class and most doesn't help with exams or homework, very nice and funny likewise.",0
This is my 3rd year of post secondary and he's by far my favourite prof! He really cares for his students and always willing to help. Everytime i visited his office it was like i was going to a friend for help. Hes a funny and nice guy to have a chat with. And he always you to redo 1 question after each exam! Got an A in the course,1
He is the worst prof ever.,0
Very interesting teaching style. Only class I don't believe I've ever slept through.,1
"Would give the weeks assignments halfway through the week, it's December 24th and the most recent assignment entered is from September. Kept on pushing back deadlines and essentially made the class last until December 23rd. Easy class. Pretty funny but posts some kind cringe anime memes but if that's your thing then go for it.",0
I would never take her class if I didn't have too. She's not very student friendly and she doesn't pay attention to her students. She's cuts you off during presentations. Theres more homework in this class then all four of my classes combined.,0
"Great class, George is very enthusiastic & very knowledgeable on Buddhism & Asian culture.  I recommend keep up with the readings, it helps with understanding the content. Perfect summer class!",1
"I have heard good things about this professor before I took this class. He is an awesome person, but this class needs another professor to teach it! Avoid him at all costs for MIS 300. His lectures (which are fun and interesting and very much off topic) on powerpoint DO NOT MATCH what he tests on. Study the text, have a friend sign you in. Easy A!",0
"This class should be called the History of Ethnicity and Race not an Intro class. Basically talks about how horrible white people were and all the horrible things they did. Does let you bring in a notecard for the test but the test question is so broad that you don't have a chance to answer it in a short amount of time. Big book, lots of reading.",1
I personally hate this class. The layout of the class is Horrible.,0
"If you want an A you have to live and breath French. Always push the limits of the language during class and with the tutor. Remember all those little finicky rules you dont think youll need (but you totally will). She want everyone to know the exact right way to use french, so remember the rules. Also, learn all the vocab before you useitinclass",1
"The best professor for theology! He cares for students by understanding they have other classes. Need an extension or to miss a class b/c youre sick? No problem, just talk to him beforehand. He always checks in with the class to see if they understand the material or are feeling stressed. Explains the material to the simplest terms. Great teacher!",1
"Though Dr. Striet knows how to get the crowd laughing, some of the exam grades weren't so funny. I started off the semester making B's on my first two exams. She increased the difficulty of her exams due to peer pressure from other professors. She also messed up grading exams. I had a B in the class until the last test. Would not recommend.",0
"This woman was out of her mind.She called out students for not showing up, which is ridiculous considering the class time (T-F 810AM!) and size (well over 200 people).  She would constantly interject useless stories about her family, some prof with short-man syndrome, how Rutgers invented the pill, and how the female sex organs are so sophisticated",0
"Dr. Mike is the best professor I've had so far. The first week he tries to scare off LSA kids, but don't drop him if you need the class. He knows that many (specially engineering) students just want to be over with the class, but he tries his very best to help you understand the material. He's funny even when the material is boring. Exams are hard.",1
"He class was interesting and I had a lot of fun. He is definitely one of the best instructors I had. His class was always well organized, which I really like. He cared about student's performance in class and always gave feedbacks to our assignments. Be sure to read the material in advance, it will be easier to participate in class discussions.",1
Unrealistic expectations for his students.  INSANELY HARD!,0
very useful. prepared me for the next course that i wanted to take. gave me the confidence that I needed to continue my studies. there were no quizes or exams not sure where the negative comments are coming from.,1
Took her Maymester class. I truly enjoyed her class. Very engaging. Will take for my other Comp class.,1
One of my favorite teachers at Southern Miss. He gives great lectures and almost everything you need to know is from the lecture. In order to receive an A in the class he says that you have to read. He is very informative and his tests are not too hard since he puts up every study guide by the first day of class.,1
"Class is 90% exam grades. Exams of which are incredibly difficult and almost impossible to do well on. This class wasn't even for my major, and I think I speak for most when I say anything remotely interesting that I could've learned in this course was ruined by her terrible teaching style. This class is such a disappointment because of this prof",0
Taking this class was a huge mistake. Her tests are impossible and there were a bunch of them.,0
REL 1312 She cares about students. Tell funny stories to break up hard material. I would take her again because I learned a lot.,1
"Very confusing lectures, he is all over the place. He gives homework that is not mandatory but only uses class time to go over that homework. Exams are hard and total surprises. Spends a lot of time talking about himself. Students are not his first priority.  Overall his class is just uncomfortable, take a different professor. ",0
this class is hard to sit through,0
"I took his sales class online, great course I recommend it.",1
"Possibly one of the most unprepared, detached teachers i have had to date, yet, in all of my years of school. He never emails you back, nor, does he care about you as a student. He seems totally burdened to teach, and it reflects in his students learning.",0
Dom is the best Professor I have ever had! I would highly recommend Dom over Tammy ANYDAY!! He is very understanding and will work with you until you have it figured out :),1
"Talbert lectures from the start of class to the end of class, so if you write slowly, this isn't the class for you. There are six papers to write, so I hope you get a good TA and that you are a decent writer. The exams are difficult, but if you know 4-5 sections REALLY WELL and know enough about the rest, you can do well on them.",1
"AWESOME PROFESSOR! She's laid back, funny, and can relate to the students. Final study guide was extremely helpful if you jot down notes. She only did two easy speeches in the class! She definitely makes you feel comfortable speaking publicly!",1
Cool guy but he rushes through the lectures and expects you to know what you're doing.  Gives a lot of extra credit and assigns little homework. The test are basically the study guides he provides you. Does not prepare you for final. Don't take him if math isn't your strong suit. *heavy accent*,0
"Mrs. Bolt was not very helpful at all. I had her online class and there were problems with Myitlab. You can never get help from them or Mrs. Bolt. She says to Email her if you had a problem but she replies back with a attitude and tries to brush you off. I went on campus to get her help, I saw her helping someone else, you can tell she was annoyed",0
Carrie made class enjoyable with creative group oriented activities. She was very easy going and kept us engaged. She was very lax with timelines and due dates and she taught us meditation techniques. A very delightful lady!,1
"Very unorganized, the whole blackboard site was very unorganized and professor didnt post some of the information that was supposed to be on there. When students asked questions in class she would say she didnt have time to answer, yet went on tangents about her personal life and stuff that had nothing to do with the material.",0
complete all the discussions and papers you will pass. Papers are short no more than 2-4 pages,1
You're better off taking this class with a different professor. Expect her to tell you that you should focus on her class and ignore your other classes.,0
"Excellent teacher but as everyone points out you have to work, so many essays but he is always available in his office or the writing center. Very organized but will tell you to go through extra steps when writing rough drafts.",1
"Took BUS028A Online for Fall 2017. Pretty easy as long as you described in detail for your discussions. Discussions every week, 2 midterm and final exam. Extra credit if you post a detailed discussion and/or reply to more students in detail. Just do the HW and reply to 2 students, and you'll be fine.",1
"Marjan gives you every opportunity to succeed. She moves quickly through her lectures, but they are all online. The class is quiz heavy, but they are open note and every single one gives you the chance to earn extra credit. She understands you may need to miss 1-2 days of class, so she makes sure you can earn the credit. NO homework.",1
Good teacher does a lot of hands on work!!  Lets you take test at home before you actually take it in class.,1
"Professor Birch's 4650 & 3050 are structured the same way and its not designed to give you any feedback nor help you improve your understanding. 90% of your grade is based on exams . Average on most exams were between 60-40% so good luck and don't expect him to help you, since all of your work is thrown away!! Guessing is encouraged, No Home Work.",0
online class: Can be really easy if you read and study. Make sure you complete all assignments. Teacher is really nice!! Can be an easy A. Always responds fast to e-mail.,1
"Jane is awesome! She knows her material inside/out & is passionate about biostatistics! You'll get 3 midterms (MC, T/F, problems), weekly hw (3-4 problems)+lab work (you can work in groups). Overall, the class was easy. She explains all the concepts clearly and gives relevant examples so they are easy to remember. Oh yeah, the final is cumulative!",1
"As far as Math goes she is as good as it gets, Math does not come easily to me and I really need to work at it and she makes it much easier to learn. I dropped a class to take her and I couldn't be happier with the switch. I would take her again. She has a sunny disposition and it shines through with the material. She cares about her students.",1
The content of this course is very interesting but unfortunately the prof for this course makes it hard to find interesting. Plus she makes the midterms worth 45% of your grade with nothing in between to fix your grade if your screw up. Plus there are many slides and not enough time for notes on each bring a camera and lots of memory or dont takeit,0
"Class was relatively easy, but the professor was vocal about his opinion on things which often had nothing to do with the class and that he was not an expert in.",0
Interesting class with great content. Participation matters and will get you the best grade possible. Highly recommend.,1
A tough grader and an awful teacher. He actually does not teach. He assigns a portion of the book to students to read it for next session and so on. This is the reason that his classes are not popular in the university.,0
"Definitely has a thick accent and is hard to understand sometimes. But she's super caring. Ms. Van Der Poel would graciously stay after class and even after her scheduled office hours to support students and go through in-class problems. Very caring professor. Note: her tests are very hard and she does not curve. Practice, practice, practice!",1
"Ms. Donham is a knowledgable teacher. Shes fairly clear in class of what to do and she basically walks you through all of the programming homework. Also, she lets you use notes on the test. Its an easy A.",1
Lecture heavy but if youre taking her online then I dont recommend. I felt like I learned little to nothing from her lectures she would post as videos.,1
"Do not take this professor unless you are a math whiz, like really fast-paced classes, or already have extensive knowledge in the class you plan to take. I took her for Trigonometry, and i was failing most of the semester. She does not take the time to explain her methods and is extremely rude to her students in class. Be ready to study hard.",0
"I honestly would not recommend him. He will give a certain type of example on the board during class, but will give you quizzes and tests on a completely different example you DID NOT do in class. Coming from someone who took Calc in HS and understood it really well and could do it in my sleep, I find it really hard to learn from Tripp.",0
She is very disorganized; you will spend large amounts of time trying to find her materials(she can't find them herself half the time). Her classes have the lowest grade averages by far(dept-wide tests). her lectures are of no value; you have to teach yourself. She is not a professor you want. Steer clear unless you want to fail.,0
Stephen is a horrible prof His grading SUCKS. More than 17 people dropped out of the class and maybe 5 made it to the end with probably 2 actually passing the class If you get a tiny part of like a 10 mark question wrong then the entire question is wrong Its basically impossible to pass unless you have a photographic memory doesnt care for student,0
Great professor. Easy on the eyes too!,1
"the worst class i have taken at oberlin.  wow, so painful.  i got As on all my papers and a B+ in the class... she just overlooked it.  said nothing that i couldn't think up or read.  not a fan",0
HOT HOT HOT HOT MAN,1
amazing.,1
"new to teaching and it ,changes his mind on what needs to be done in assignment hard to know what he wants",0
I took characteristics: mild/moderate and there is a module due once a week. There are lots of things in this module so I recommend not procrastinating it.,1
"Engaging lecturer, absolutely brilliant thinker, and astonishingly helpful in office hours. Brimming with poise. Her class will push you; whiners need not apply. I learned more in her class than any other so far: new words, new  appreciation, new approaches to lit.  Challenging, but clear and patient when you need help. The next gen. of great profs",1
"I'm currently doing the 1st 5 weeks summer course in the midst of COVID-19, and so far, it's awesome. Tests are take-home exams (you can use anything), but most of the answers are literally in his lecture messages box. His jokes are alright, but all I can say is that it's definitely worth the 8AM. Lectures can be dry, but you'll def get use to it.",1
Great prof.,1
"I dont know what he is like in person but his online class sucks. He has two sites that for assignments which can be confusing, and no notifications for when he makes a new assignment. For due dates some quizzes don't have a due date while others do which is misleading. Also you don't know if a certain assignment has a due date until it is too late",0
"I do have to agree with some people below. Yes, he does tend to make occasional politically incorrect jokes. I believe he is a conservative. He did make 1 racist joke in class, which got a few laughs out of people. Funniest moment was when he totally planted this guy in class to ask a question so he could plug some book/documentary he was in.",0
Chem 7L lab is dependent on your TA for they grade your lab reports. Lab reports are already formatted and just need to be filled in. Material for the lab report and experiments are all covered in the lectures. Carly is extremely thorough in her lectures and practice problems are just like the final. TA's will determine your grade though.,1
"Ning dosent teach.  You have to be able to study and learn the material on your own.  Attendance is a must, due to the fact you have in class work sheets you have to do everyday for credit.  You can work with a partner on the material and when your done you can leave.  I would not recommend this class if you can not learn math on your own.",0
The prof is fairly knowledgeable in the subject. In the intro level class she can sometimes move a bit too fast for students with no experience or knack for programming. Willing to work 1 on 1 with students after lectures. Most tests are open book and notes.,1
"Hes a nice guy but his teaching style made this class unnecessarily complicated. He doesnt post notes and talks super fast, he doesnt give a study guide for exams, and the exams are worded badly which makes answering the questions frustrating. Attendance is random and so are quizzes. i dont recommend this class.",0
"He is a good teacher. He does PowerPoint slides almost exclusively, but the tests are pretty close to what's covered. Tests make you think a quite bit and are in general a good challenge, his only real problem is that he's an unforgiving grader. Make sure everything is absolutely perfect before handing it in or your grade will be punished.",1
"Twyla was very nice, which made it worse that her class was terrible. She's very strict and not lenient with students at all over miscommunications. She made many mistakes herself, which's fine, but then refused to accept any grace when students made mistakes. She's a good person, not a good prof. Please choose another professor if you can.",0
"One of the worst professors I've had. Never responded to emails, and went on tangents not related to the class all the time. Take another teacher for this class. Exams were almost impossible with her teaching.",0
he doesn't really know how to teach. but he's ok because he gives good grades. plus he's not bad looking. so class is not a total waste. o' yeah he talks a lot bout turkey and flying.,0
Great class. Lots of reading but not too difficult,1
"First online class during a pandemic, was very clear on requirements but honestly wasn't even remotely understanding to how stressful life outside of school is right now. Also made it a point to throw guilt when it wasn't necessary.",0
AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!!! I have NEVER had an online class with as many assignments due each week. If you take this professor you might as well quit your job if you want to pass. Professor also wants nothing to do with the students so good luck getting in touch with her. Also all tests require computer lock down and webcam.,0
"This guy is the easiest teacher to get along with.  He's simply a teenager stuck in a man's body, but he really knows his stuff so don't fret. (lol, it's a guitar joke)  If you have been playing guitar for more than 3 yrs then take lessons with him and not his other classes. Do yourself a favor and just have fun in his class/lesson. ROCK AND ROLL!",1
i HATE this class. he is a good teacher but the class is so hard. its all writing based for the most part. he isnt super clear during lectures.. tends to ramble. this class makes me wanna kill myself. no joke,1
The professor is definitely educated when it comes to philosophy but tried way too hard to make the class difficult. I took him for summer b term this year. There is a timed reading quiz for every single reading assigned. He assigns multiple readings every week. About 8-11 assignments due every week. All quizzes and exams have original questions.,0
Very hard to understand when you have never taken a French class. Talks only in French when you have never heard it in your life before. Each homework takes about 3 hours and is very tedious.,0
"Erkoc is a very fair teacher. He teaches a very difficult subject and does his best to simplify things. If you pay attention in lecture and have a natural inclination to Programming and Excel and will devote the work to the projects, an A is very attainable. Beware though if you miss class and do not learn the tricks on Excel/Arena",1
"Very hard course with him, a lot of the class is failing. Tests are hard (avg grade = 35!. C = 50). OK at teaching (2 out of 5).",0
"boring you want to kill yourself. I had Chaucer in high school and couldn't wait to take a course in college. HS was better, we learned something about the middle ages. The one good thing is that  its an easy A.",0
"Decent professor. explains things well and easy to talk to. wants you to succeed, you just have to put in the work and go to office hours. His lectures aren't the most interesting and he speaks in a monotone, but if you pay attention and engage you'll be good.",1
"Professor Bazil is one of the worst professors I have ever had. He is disorganized, does not follow the syllabus, and does not answer emails. He is not clear on what is expected and does not answer questions so its a guessing game majority of the time. Making an A should not have been a problem, but due to his disorganization it was impossible.",0
Absolutely loved Dr. Wisner! I've been out of school for 20 years and this class was an easy A. Just read and follow instructions for all assignments and you will do fine. Only complaint was feedback was not given in real time which would have been helpful for future assignments but would definitely take him again for 1102 if I get the chance!,1
Awful experience here. She can't teach. No help. Lots of homework. Blah blah blah in class (not about the material and subject we need).,0
"Sara is so passionate about what she does and it's obvious. After taking her intro class, I changed my major to social work. As long as you come to class, do her extra credit assignments, and study for her tests then you'll do really well in her class. I would highly recommend taking anything from her.",1
"I would never take this professor again. She is extremely unorganized and does not want students contacting her. She does not leave her number or email. You can reach her through the WWCC website; however, she will not respond. She wants students to ask questions through discussions. Her response time is late and does not explain her grading.",0
"Really really great guy. Cares a lot about what he's teaching and WHO he's teaching. Easy to get to know,would be a great teacher for later recommendations. Would keep in touch for sure. ",1
"I made a huge mistake taking Prf. Smith. She is nasty, sarcastic, doesn't give good feedback on papers, and is very unorganized. I should've stuck with my professor from last semester. Prf. Smith runs her class in an ""my way or no way"" kind of fashion. Do not take her, ever.",0
"Dr. Palacios seems to be a kind person, but her teaching ability is fairly mediocre. She assigned 10 group activities worth 2% each, consuming an inordinate amount of time and forcing students to rely on others for a portion of their final grade. She even allowed fellow students to mark each other's essay on the midterm - this is not acceptable.",0
"If you show up & pay attention you can get a lot out of the class. I, however, tend to not show up a& not pay attention. All homework and tests were online, so it's pretty easy. He does NOT communicate. Although you need to be prepared to teach yourself, I still think he's a decent teacher.",0
"Worst professor I've ever had. Thick accent to the point you can't understand, and he doesn't slow down to pronuniciate his words. Makes all concepts so difficult and literally speeds through everything. Tests are 60% of the grade so you better know what you're doing. No extra credit & lots of homework only worth 10%. Take someone, ANYONE else.",0
"Shes caring and all but if you're not good at math don't take her class. She teaches differently and is more advanced she told me to basically withdraw from the course since I wasn't understanding her way of teaching. She expects you to already know everything and move on to the next lesson after a week, also too much homework.",0
"A very difficult class to do. I took her online so I didn't get to meet her in person. She was a very difficult grader and had very unclear instructions on her assignments. She has a lot of work for you to do, and I honestly would not recommend her unless you like difficult classes. A lot of the highest scores for assignments weren't even 100%.",0
"Stay away from McConnell. His classes are dry, his voice monotone, and his readings tedious. There is not too much work and he is an easy grader, however it's still not worth it. He's v vague in his assignment descriptions and seems to grade many papers without reading them. Even films did not make this class any more enjoyable.",0
"Rick is a funny guy, which will help his lectures stick. But he can come off a bit rude at times and embarrass you in front of class. He is a lawyer though, and with lawyers, the ""attitude"" comes with it. He really teaches you the practical parts of real estate law and you definitely learn from him. I would take his class again.",1
"I love Dr. Scoville. He's not the most organized professor I've ever had, but he's very flexible and helpful when there's confusion. He really cares about all of his students, and is very passionate about what he teaches. Definitely one of my favorite Arabic professors.",1
Professor De Luna is extremely easy. There's only 13 quizzes that go based off chapters from the book. Most of which can be found on quizlet. Easy A.,1
"The red flag not to take: he wrote the textbook, refers to himself in it many times This course is doable, just a lot of hoops to go through for a 200-level psych course (if it was listed 400 level - ok). The caucasity really shows when he calls tai chi a ""slow motion exercise"" but Wikipedia lists it as martial arts. Sends pass agg emails.",0
WORST ACCT TEACHER AT CLEMSON!! DOESNT UNDERSTAND THAT ACCOUNTING IS DONE ON THE COMPUTER NOW...NOT BY HAND!! MAKE SURE YOU LOVE WRITING OUT YOUR ACCT PROBLEMS IN A BLUE BOOK BEFORE YOU TAKE THIS TEACHER.,0
"I love having him! He's always very chill. His assignments aren't worth a lot individually and are usually pretty straight forward, but they add up! Make sure to keep up with them. Very easy to get an excellent grade in his class. He reminds me of a teddy bear too lol but that's beyond the point. Would recommend!",1
If you are looking for a challenge and want to become a math pro make sure this is the only class you are taking because he will throw every trick problem on the test in fact he will determine if you pass his class or not on the first test. Do not go to office hours as he is on his phone and not very helpful with feed back. Expect no mercy.,0
Take Dr. K.  I would take him again.  Read material & you will past. You need the book and the exams are sort of hard.  Take note of weekly sessions because he locks them each week.  The notes will be helpful during exam time.  Awesome professor,1
"She takes such a long time to grade things, so if that is something that irritates you, do NOT have her as a teacher.  Very nice and gives good feedback, but I have been waiting a week and a half for my midterm grade.",1
"Vague rubrics for projects which sucks, but he had good availability outside of class.  Funny, interesting lectures, he seemed to actually like teaching so that was great!",1
Anurag was a good professor who covered all the required materials. Would be happy to have him again.,1
This man is a horrible professor. I have never in my 20 years of living encountered a man so distasteful and rude to their students for absolutely no reason. Then you get to class and you're lucky if he let you know what was going on ahead of time because he can be so useless to be such a nasty man. Very strict attendance policy so be wise,0
"Honestly did not teach me anything in class, had to learn everything from the textbook and from the Organic Chemistry Tutor on YouTube. Three tests all with averages well-below 50%. No homework, really nothing other than tests.",0
tests vary from easy to hard..notes come from slideshows,1
"Professor Lipson is obviously a very knowledgeable person, but his soothing voice and his tangential lecture style makes it hard for me to stay engaged in the class. Ive learnt a lot from this professor from the first half of the semester, but as the semester progressed I felt he was pushing many claims without a strong base of evidence.",0
"If you think you can take his just to get an easy A, you're right. BUT you have to work for it, it is not just handed to you. He likes when his students go in depth with comparisons and opinions. You cannot just submit a bull assignment, you actually have to think about it.",1
"He literally gives you every answer to the tests. Grading is just 6 tests and go to 2 orchestra concerts. He's very... eccentric. Talks about political issues a lot, which I think is more interesting than music anyway. I recommend him. Do not get the book, it's a waste. Just buy the online access code.",1
"i failed the class once. but let me tell you, the first time i took the class we had masters students taking the class too. all of the exams were DIFFICULT. you still can pass but you wont be able to get the grade you r wokring for. i took the class again and didnt have any MASTERS students and the class was easy. and i got the grade i worked for. ",0
She gives an unnecessary amount of homework and takes forever to grade it. I always dreaded going to her class but she did cancel quite often.,0
"Short papers, blogs and a 4-5 part final paper.  At least 2 of these are due every week.  She's not clear on answers. Open book tests but she takes so many points off for everything else that it doesn't matter. Expects very detailed everything but never gives an example of what she wants and you lose an incredible amount of points for it. ",0
His class was thorough and very easy to follow he explained everything perfectly and answered all questions when asked. He does have random quizzes Which threw me off at first and he won't announce test so check the syllabus in advance also on the Note of quizzes he allows you to partner quiz almost the entire quarter.,1
Prof. Liebman is really tough grader ! Anyway do your best and you will be fine .,1
"Cat is great! She expects a lot, but she is fair and you come out better for it.  She comes off as intimidating, but once you get to know her that goes away real fast.  This woman knows her stuff and can rock your ecology world.  I would recommend everyone taking a class with her at some point.",1
"Prof Misra is eh. He's not the worst but he's not the best either. He has a strong accent so understanding him is difficult. There are 4 test given: 2 in class, 1 open notes, and 1 take home. To be frank, you still need to know everything cause the final is in class. I ended up just teaching myself with the book and reviewed in class with him.",0
"Not a bad teacher, he just needs to explain in more detail about assignments and get his point across.  The class is strictly writing papers so beware.  Very opinionated, its either his way or the highway.  Can be a little  much at times.",1
"I loved class with Prof. Walker. She knows the material, makes it funny, caring and, understanding of her students. Also, the material isn't that tough either. She is very accommodating of late work and deadlines but don't make it a habit.",1
Professor Brown is a nice guy outside of class. In class he is very into himself and thinks his opinion is the only opinion. He expects you to know what he is talking about at all times even if you've never learned about it. He is an extremely hard grader. Lots of quizzes and if you aren't there for one you can fail the class. Dont take this class.,0
"WORST professor EVER. Terrible at lectures. She just goes on and on over nonsense. Most isn't even related to what would be on the quizzes or useful when it came to writing essays. Quizzes aren't THAT bad when you read the chapters too, but lectures are still very required so you can listen to the nonsense that actually shows up on them.",0
"Brilliant professor, and you won't get bored during lectures. It is very discussion heavy, and she wants everyone to participate and it is a huge part of your grade. Also a ton of reading, but I found all of it to be really interesting although it did take a long time. Long midterm and final, some quizzes and one group project. Learned a lot!",1
"I've never failed a course until I took this class. I know at least 6 others who failed, and not for lack of trying either. Early in the term I expressed concern for my grade, and he just told me to drop the class, pick another major. He grades tests and essays on an unbelievably hard scale.  I no longer even want to major in psychology.",0
took during covid 19. where to begin with this one. the teacher had us use MML by Pearson for the whole class. every week we did seven or more homeworks with a varying number of problems. for a full explanation go to google and search mymathlab reddit (cant post link so gl),0
"This is the absolute most disrespectful person I have ever had to encounter. Extremely rude, unsympathetic, and name calls. Completely unprofessional, and you need to have some proof that you were tardy else she will mark you as unexcused absent causing your grade to be potentially affected. Avoid this professor at all costs.",0
"Honestlyonly take this class if you already have some photography/adobe premiere experience. His assignments forced me to get out of my comfort zone, which I appreciated. Having your work ripped apart in front of your peers helps to develop tough skinif you can't handle critique from Cheers, you're not cut out for Journalism, honey!! Get out now!",0
"First of all, Leonard seems like a genuinely good guy. As a professor, he was terrible. I hate to be harsh, but I dont want anyone else to waste time and money like I did; this was the worst class I have ever taken. The lectures were terrible, he didnt respond to email, he didnt understand English very well... please do not take his class.",0
"DON'T TAKE HIM. Supposed to be an easy A class and he makes it so unnecessarily hard. He rambles on in class about info that isn't even pertinent to the test. Tests are 10 essay questions that are worded in the worst possible way. You HAVE to read the textbook bc you don't learn anything from him, and even then good luck getting a passing grade.",0
"Taking Dr. Bardo for SOC 255 was a great decision. There are no exams, attendance is not mandatory, there are only 7 quizzes and he drops the lowest two, and the largest portion of your grade comes from an easy project at the end of the semester. I have learned a lot about medical sociology from him and HIGHLY recommend his class!",1
"Always comes in late, always has an excuse",0
Hard Tests. Rambling Lectures. READ THE BOOK.,0
"This class has an extremely heavy workload that does not enhance the concepts or themes of the class. Assignments are unclear, rubrics are useless or nonexistent. Lisa tries to help, but the workload is huge and the assignments are really just busy work to her specifications, not knowledge enhancing or helpful. This was my worst class in my field.",0
Teaches nothing but theory. Does not show you how to work any problems and then that's all that's on your test!,0
"You will never find a more caring, passionate, and professional teacher than Matt. He will do his absolute best to help you succeed. A truly rare breed of professor.",1
"Great Professor! There's not enough of them any more. She kept it simple and made you focus on what was important. If you are not ready to study don't take her class. But she motivates you to want to do well in her class, she is not out to fail you. You earn your grade. Would take her class again any time.",1
who let this man teach a&p 2?? I'll update at the end of the semester (unless I drop) but it is already awful and it's only week three...,0
I've never heard of having to do papers in a math class but we have almost weekly papers on concepts he hasn't even taught yet,0
"""GOOD MORNING"" ""HAVE I LOST ANYONE"" *random music plays in the background* ""IT HELPS ME GET IN THE ZONE"" Okay Shawn, okay, we get it.",0
"There aren't a lot of lectures involved. She gives a very large amount of homework but as long as you go through the lectures before you do it, you should pass pretty easily.",1
"this course has such bare content that it could be compressed easily into half a semester. the prof has a likable personality. hes not a bad teacher but doesnt go above and beyond either. do the questions in the book but expect a little tougher on the exam, and you should be ok.",1
"Never been a stranger to hard work. Professor Lunn is very knowledgeable, and knows her course very well. She is very inspirational, and encourages us to not give up. But, if you don't come to her class, that will be the grade that you earn. No student is above the other, in her classes. Everyone is on an equal playing field.",1
Posted 1st test grade then waited until AFTER the 4th test was taken to post grades. When asked what my current average was she told me that she would tell me next week. I tried my absolute deans list best to teach myself everything and still had to drop with 4 other students (not counting the ones that dropped way earlier in the course).DONT TAKE!,0
"He uses the phrase ""social justice"" when talking about poor people.  I wish some people wouldn't offend the rest of us with Communist-indoctrination vocabulary.",1
Paul Kirz is the BEST!,1
"His grading is extremely hard, loves to talk down to people and seems full of himself. This is a capstone course, so it's required. Before taking this course, make sure that you ask your regular legal research instructor to teach you how to write up legal memos and how to prepare legal forms b/c Wiley will not. Good luck!",0
He gives incredibly long lectures that are not engaging. NR001 was a joke. Not enjoyable at all. I would recommend that if you want to be in Rubenstein that you start freshman year as undeclared and then transfer into Rubenstein sophomore year. That way you only have to take one class as a transfer student as opposed to NR001 and NR002.,0
"Great class, great professor! I am a really busy person so I appreciate that everything was so well organized, no last minute surprises. I used the study guides she provided and they seemed to match the tests really well.",1
"Being a nutrition major, I thought I was going to enjoy this ""easy"" class; boy was I wrong. This is a 4 unit class (in a qtr system) and takes more than double the time of my other 2 five unit classes combined(no exaggeration). If you like harsh grading, non-stop hw, and really hard quizestests for only 4 units(qtr system), this is ur teacher!",0
"Prof. Trombley is a really good prof. She is very specific in her instructions on what she wants. If you do what she asks you will have no problems passing her class. her tests are hard but not that hard. If you put you time in and actually read everything you will pass easily. Her classes are not hard, just she very particular in what she wants.",1
"This man has his head in perfect alignment of what needs to happen. If you do your work and actually try, you will pass. You will not get sympathy for your lack of work. He's a catch though!",1
"This guy teaches for himself and not students. The class is devoted to his repetitive life stories. My class literally had to teach themselves. Leave during class he takes points off tests! How? He just decides to make questions on YOUR test worth less!!  O yeah, and he doesn't round up grades--I got a 79%. very unorganized for an accountant.",0
"Worst finance Professor at Salisbury. Class isnt too boring but you will not learn anything. Each test, more than 90% of the class did not finish on time. He says lazy things like how him grading your work makes him deserve teacher of the year. Do Not Take him.",0
"Dont take this teacher..horrible does not give students credit for the work that they spend days on. Useless class a lot better english teachers out there to take their online class. I do not recommend this teacher at all,especially during summer.",0
Prof Corker was awful. She did not even pretend to care about her students. She also teaches the material like we should already know it and gets upset when we don't. Be ready to do lots of work. And don't bother asking her questions-- she's not very helpful at all. Get someone else if possible,0
Terrible prof. Very broad and generic lectures. Unhelpful lectures. Very vague class. Makes it super difficult to prepare for the exam. Would not recommend taking biomechanics with him. Worst class experience by far.,0
"If you're someone without a life, a job, and a family and you have nothing better to do than study this is the class for you!!! You can spend hours upon hours studying, thinking you know every thing there is to know about it and you'll still do horribly on her impossible exams. Don't miss a lab! 6% auto deducted. ONLY positive: great curver!",0
This class is not bad at all. He writes down everything that he thinks is important on the board as he goes over it in class. Take good notes and that will be the ultimate study guide for the test. There are no surprises with his tests and he usually offers some extra credit questions on there. It is tempting to skip lectures but don't.,1
"worst prof. I've ever had, the online 6 week class is a joke and I don't recommend taking it, she does not know how to teach and likes to throw in tough trick questions.",0
"You can tell Sam is a very smart man, and he genuinely enjoys what he teaches. However lectures are very unstructured and don't follow any slides. You have to pay close attention to catch what's important. If you get a good GSI (which i did not) your discussion section will help you acheive the grade you want. You HAVE to go to lecture to do well.",1
"Midterm: 30%, final: 40%. Most people skip lecture as it's hard to follow - read textbook instead. Quite tough on partial credit on exams. That said, he tests on less than the material covered and is clearly a very fair grader who cares about students succeeding (also has no curve, but drops lowest quiz and HW). TA is incredibly helpful.",1
"I'm sure she is good at what she does in-person, but as for her online class, it's a disaster. I have no idea how to navigate the blackboard page for her class and even the syllabus doesn't match what she actually wants us to do. Just a lot of miscommunication and disorganization.",0
"Mme King is a great teacher and person. Totally recommended for taking French with her, especially French I! She's very caring of her students, teaches well, and is generally accessible outside of class and responds to emails in decent timing.",1
If you want a easy A take this class. No lockdown browser. All test and quizzes on canvas. 3 test 4 quizzes per test. Easy class pick this professor,1
"Dr. Boden is the only reason i use rate my professor from now on. taking his 100 level class was a great challenge and even though many hours were spent doing homework, lab reports, tests, quizzes, and taking notes i ended receiving a C for this class. never had participated in such a hard 100 level class, no extra credit avilable. not recommended!",0
Liked him as a person but is horrible as a professor. He should stick to what he is good at- writing. He plays favorites and I never had him as a professor prior to Sales. However in my one and only semester with him I found all the rumors to be true...worst semester ever. IF there is ANYONE else teaching Sales - Getaway from Gerber!!,0
"The WORST professor I have ever had the unfortunate chance of knowing. She is terrible with directions, does not thoroughly read through submitted assignments & then deducts points because of her terrible reading skills, and takes 5+ days to get back to you on any questions you may have. She also gives you 40 minutes to complete a 60 question exam.",0
"This class almost sets you up to fail. There is a review session for the midterm, yet not a single thing taught in the session was involved in the midterm. There really is no way of preparing for the midterm unless you know every detail of everything. Seriously. TA's are useless, they confuse you more than anything.",0
"Although professor Villanueva is very experienced and knowledgeable in the subject, she does lack the understanding that students already have a demanding workload and has chosen to make it increasingly difficult. Especially in the midst of a pandemic she continues to grade harshly and make major assignments due two days apart.",0
"Very interesting teacher. Seems to have clear expectations of his students, but expects way too much of them. Has this whole ordeal about teaching his students to work hard for their grade and that they will come out of his class learning something. Way too much work to be done. Every week is a quiz, project, and a draft for an essay. Good luck.",0
Mr. Gandy is awesome! He's fun to talk to and cracks jokes during his lectures. He doesn't assign homework other than the occasional extra credit. 99% of all learning is through his lectures. His tests are reflected off the in class notes. Just take notes and review them the night before the test and you've got at the very least a B.,1
She is such an amazing professor!!! I am taking my history seminar with her and have learned so much. I have learned not only information about the topic but important skills like doing research on my own and putting together a professional research paper. She has helped me so much in office hours and I wish I could take another class with her.,1
"Mean, just mean",0
"STAY AWAY IF YOU HAVE ANXIETY! She is THE most disorganized professor I've ever had. It is currently November & she has yet to grade a SINGLE paper or discussion board post for the ENTIRE semester. Last week's REQUIRED reading totaled 170 pgs, yet the syllabus (which she's changed 3 times) says to only expect 50 pgs a week. She's so out of touch.",0
"Extremely caring and nice professor! Made himself accessible in every way incase a student needed to contact him. Was understanding about not having a textbook on time due to personal reasons and works with all of his students! However, taking him online there was a lot of homework every day and he grades heavily and hard on 3 major essays!",1
"Very tough teacher. But, I haven't been more dedicated in an English class than I have been in his. His grading is tough, but if you put in the effort he will be easier. Also, try to make him laugh because then he'll see you as a friend and will grade a whole lot easier.",1
The professor makes the class so easy for us.,1
Good luck with her. She dosent explain anything thats on the test and gives very boring lectures.,0
"I thought I hated ""art music,"" but this class changed my perspective.",1
"If you have any doubt or question, he will answer back with another question. He does not care about telling you the answer. Lectures are very boring too. The content of the class is good and the programming assignments are nice and challenging.",0
"He's a very tough grader, but he does give extra credit. Also, as long as you put in some effort, you should pass the class with at least a C. Getting an A is really difficult, but it is possible. You get around 4 essays, and one grammar final. Be prepared to study that grammar.",1
"Due to the pandemic and making no accommodations in teaching style or tests, this is the worst class I have ever taken at Missouri State. I would definitely recommend other professors for this class that were more accommodating and understanding due to the pandemic.",0
"Seems like a great teacher if you take his class in person. I, however, took his class online and it was not great. He words instructions poorly, his grading expectation is that you photograph your notebook work and submit that instead of using ExploringStatistics or another online module (What?) for homework, & doesn't list test dates in syllabus.",0
"Lamore was a fine professor in the beginning. his grading though is the worst. firstly he grades to perfection basically. I already struggle writing papers, the best I got them was a C, and even when I rewrite them he grades things that I fixed. plus his lectures are so boring, I was also in a support class and it was 3 hours of lectures.",0
"Be prepared to study 20+ hours a week for a C. She is a passionate teacher, but VERY nitpicky I spent more time reading her rules and grading criteria than the book. Tests are insanely difficult, and class is regimented. Shes all about application of material which is great if you're going into healthcare. If you just need the grade go with Bassett",0
"My favorite teacher at CCNY thus far. She gives great feedback and it's obvious that she wants the best for all her students. She's accessible outside of class, and depending on how much your class participates, she gives extra credit. Attending lecture is mandatory! Pop quizzes! But she's great and understanding as long as you communicate.",1
"Worst Experience at TCU yet. Reading and Quizzes every night and she takes forever to grade anything, so you won't know that you're failing the class until it's too late. But really my problem is that she is incredibly biased. She teaches opinion as if its fact and expects everyone to agree with her and then tests you on her opinions. DO NOT TAKE!!",0
"The professor doesn't respond in a timely manner. She doesn't check the answers on her exams, there were 5 wrong answers on our midterm (unable to determine if there were any wrong answers on the final). She is laid back in class but a tough grader. You must read the book and come to class if you want to pass. Shows up late often",0
"Dr. Puneet seems like she is trying to do a good job but she just isn't. In terms of learning, you would probably get more out of listening to an audio version of the text book at 2x speed. If you have to take her I suggest doing the homework in class and watching Khan Academy or Organic Chemistry Tutor videos for the stuff you haven't encountered.",0
"If you don't go to class you will not pass the tests. Lectures and content is easy, it's just the listening part on tests that is what kills you. Very clear about expectations from the start, nice guy but comes off as kinda arrogant. Hard class to have as an 8am. Bring coffee or find a different time.",0
"Has a unique way of capturing your attention by approaching his lectures every time with a positive attitude and a smile. he makes history not at all boring, but fun and interesting.",1
"She is the best Accounting teacher ever! I took her for accounting 1 & 2. I received A's in both courses. If you do the study plan she will give you up to 10 point to your total grade (up to 5 points each half of the class). Attend class she explains thing well, practice exams Are the same as the mid term and final just different number. #easyA",1
"Shes such a great professor, she cares ALOT about her students and she made me love psychology",1
"Not a horrible professor, but also not the best. The cons were that you needed to use the textbook because she gives unit quizzes on the textbook and if you don't take your own notes from the textbook, you won't pass these. The tests are hard and she doesn't really help in class so everything is up to you. She doesn't show she cares about you.",0
I took his course online and thought he was an excellent instructor.  His emails were personal and not generic.  He was willing to give plenty of positive feedback to good performance and his writing guidelines were easy to understand.,1
"Northrup not only is dedicated to helping students understand the material, but he also cares about his student's wellbeing. He gives great lectures and makes all the lecture material available online for review. Although at times he can be forgetful, he knows this and takes reminders about things graciously. Overall, the best prof I've ever had",1
"She doesn't allow tech in the classroom. If caught then a quiz will be given to the entire class. Says don't need textbook, but puts on study guide for midterm & final that you need to look at certain sections in chapters. You only get 7 things graded (2 test, 2 quizzes, 1 paper, 1 hw, and attendance) so if you don't test well don't take this prof.",0
"Be prepared to teach yourself. There's no organization, no sense of direction and she's not responsive whenever you ask a question for further clarification. You're literally trying to play guess who with the assignments/papers and she also takes FOREVER to grade. Sweet lady but I would not take her again.",0
He's pretty awesome with being a straight forward guy. As long as you're there than you're good. He's really great at helping if you don't like your grade but only as long as you're there. It's pretty much impossible to fail. Grading can be a bit brutal on some papers but for the most part I'd take him again.,1
"EXTREMELY USELESS. Doesn't get to the point at all. Skips through 10 slides at a time and speaks only about how iPads and iPods are revolutionizing the world. If you get her, SWITCH TO ALEC CRAM. He's much better!",0
Doesnt teach. Stumbles through examples with no explanation. Relies on terrible online portal for everything. Teamed us up at the beginning of the semester and expected us to teach each other for her. Way too many students. An overall accurate example of WIUs standard of teacher.,0
"If you enjoy taking 3 hour tests online that requires u to memorize 3-4 chapters of the book plus his power points and theeen an in class quiz the day after the online test which you know ur gonna fail because its so hard he even knows it himself, take him :) Other than that he is a very knowledgable man and you will learn a lot about business lol",0
"Worst Professor at NJIT.  I am looking to get him booted.  He never changes his slides, his accent is heavy, he is confused himself when he talks, his exams are confusing and do not correlate to what he teaches, he responds 2 days later too questions, the structure of his class sucks, bad textbook selection, overall he needs a major makeover.",0
"I couldnt possibly be more open to a teacher, she is amazing. I can email her about ANYTHING and she would help relating what she had gone through with her son giving her students the best possible solutions to things whether it is class related or not. 1000/10 best teacher period. Thanks to her i am a semester ahead in the first 2 weeks i started.",1
He is really smart. Lectures are informative about everything not just the course. Respects students even when they can be rude or disruptive to the class. He changed some dates on the syllabus but it was for the better of the class and we have more time for final projects.,1
"I don't understand why this teacher yells during his lecture as if the class cannot hear him. He is ineffective as a professor because during a group quiz, none of the students knew what was going on. I would advise to take another professor over this one.",0
"very oppinonated woman.  Gets on her soap box way too much and plays favorites big time.  Stay on her good side, and be sure to never question a grade she may give you, b/c she will hold it over your head.",0
"You wouldn't know this class is a gened based on how harsh he grades you. You have to get down to the specific details of his rubrics in order to get an A in this class. When the class is struggling to understand what he wants, he records extremely condescending videos and shares them. Do not take this gened if you need world society filled.",0
i asked for helped. he made it clear for me and seemed to care about my success and volunteered future assistance. This professor will help if you seek him out.,1
"He was a pretty solid professor. His accent was not too bad, he's easy going, and he provided great reviews for the exams. As far as I can tell, he is hands-down the best option for 2450. Just make sure you get a good group for the semester project. That could make or break this class.",1
"I really enjoyed the class discussions and it it seemed that as long as you show up, participate, and do the work you will probably get an A.  There was a substantial amount of reading, which can be a bit much if you have other classes with heavy reading.  Overall she is lovely, knows her field, and makes class fun.",1
The whole grade is 2 projects a mid term a final and a quiz at the start of each class. She expects everyone to figure out what she wants through her mediocre instructions. She illprepared to say the least and should not be allowed to teach at a college level since she doesnt know parts of the criteria her self. Find a way around having to takeher,0
He does not give a clear description of the assignments but still penalizes youre grade if you arent writing exactly how he likes. Even after emailing to ask for clearer guidelines he did not provide any.,0
"She gives quizzes almost every class, and she tries to trip you up on them. If there's not a quiz that day then you have group work.  Attendance is a must; due to the  quizgroup points. One of those professors that want her class to be your top priority, even with four other classes. ",1
This stats class was not bad at all. I have had a hard time with this course for 2 semesters and finally took it online and passed. Must do all the homework and he drops the lowest test score. You have plenty on chances to redo your  work and also get 2 chances for tests. Not super hard as long as you keep up.,1
"Terrible teacher, mean, angry, does not care about his students; I don't know why he ever became a teacher. Have to study a lot and use the textbook.  DONT take him you will regret it",0
Had her for Pharm I and II and Biomed aspects of aging. Great prof and person. Speaks clearly and is very helpful.,1
The lectures don't have content but the labs are great and really helpful! The online quizes literally have nothing that we have ever learnt !!! but there are only two.,0
"such a good prof. 3 papers no test, no quizzes. participate and write decent papers you will do just fine. easy 4.0. DO TAKE",1
"She was fantastic and interesting in a class that is typically boring. I learned a lot from her, and she was incredibly well prepared for each and every class.",1
"None of your exams and tests actually have reviews that correlate to the test. There is too many places where your work is such as owl, McGraw hill, and then on blackboard you have your lockdown browser tests and exams so everything is disorganized and very confusing. Overall, this was a super hard course so I withdrew, would not recommend.",0
Be ready to pay a lot of money for a homework website. Also be ready to have homework that Van Horn will not warn you about,0
"I do NOT reccomend this teacher. His Biology 101 class is one day a week, and you have THREE quizzes every class. He is unorganized and someone else comes up with his tests, so he has no clue what will be on them. He gives no study guides or extra credit. My friend missed one day of class and his grade went down TWO letter grades. No leniency!",0
"Really kind and funny. However, not the best instructor if you really want to learn politics and follow the textbook. Class material doesn't correlate much with textbook material. Tests are based more on textbook than his lecture notes. He gave my class a research paper to boost grades as some were failing. Likes when you participate a lot.",1
"I am thoroughly impressed with how Dr. Kelley laid out course materials in Blackboard. Everything is easily accessible, organized to limit confusion for students. I WISH that every professor would lay out their classes this way.",1
"There's a lot of work to do in this class, but you'll be fine if you keep up with the work and the deadlines. The guy talks a lot but overall, chill professor.",1
"Very difficult class, expectations were unclear, syllabus was unclear, tests are hard, labs are confusing, lectures are boring and often confusing. She is available to students outside of class but does not help much. I would not take another class with her.",0
Lisa is amazing. She's a great life coach. She legitimately wants students to learn and be successful.,1
"If you are looking for an ""easy"" (3) Theater Credits to satisfy your Fine Art requirement, look elsewhere.  This is class nor Professor will be an ""easy"" course.  She has no tolerance for truancy and you will be expected to read every word in the book, be quizzed with no heads-up on what you are being quizzed on AND you better perform via GOTE!",1
"In adjusting to the online format, Prof Wiebe has continued to go with 1h 20 min lectures, which he uses to go off on side tangents frequently. Be prepared to work hard in his class, as most phil 140 classes I've heard to be among the easier side of classes, but unfortunately not this one.",0
"Took online. A really nice and understanding teacher. Grades highly if he sees you made a good effort and recognize your mistakes in discussion boards. Quiz every week with three tests mixed in, all based off of the weeks discussions. Didnt have to ask for help but knew he would be there if I needed it!",1
"Sometimes I was a little lost in the lecture, but he will stop what he's doing to make sure everyone is caught up before he moves on. He is a great teacher and really cares about the material he is teaching.",1
"Yasser is a very nice person, and a very intelligent professor as well. However, don't expect to get clear answers when you ask a question in class. His exams are based primarily on his notes from the board, so you really cannot afford to miss class, UNLESS he refers to a textbook for the whole semester.",0
"Dr. Nixons class was set up pretty confusing. I had to email her a lot and check with other classmates so often just to understand the exact point of each assignment. Weekly checklist states A LOT of reading assignments, but to be honest theyre not necessary at all. Class is mostly just 4 big papers, if you choose a good topic it isnt too hard.",1
"He clearly couldn't care less whether you are successful in his class or not. How this man has ever gotten a decent review, i do not know. His review outlines for tests are ridiculously broad, he basically just asks you to memorize ""anything of importance"" in the textbook. If you have a question he will either respond rudely or in an unhelpful way.",0
The professor is very good at explaining the concepts of Java and helps us understand the logic behind every code!,1
"mr bohuslav is a genious, extremely passionate about architecture and the program, he really really cares about each and one of his students and their success, very tough but understanding. very demanding but caring. he pushes us so much because he knows thats the only way to get the best of us. If you truly want to learn, take him, otherwise no.",1
He has a nice personality one-on-one but he doesnt really converse with the class as a whole about anything other than history. He doesnt exactly create a comfortable atmosphere where people look forward to talking and answering questions.,0
"He makes you work ridiculously hard for an A, and all of the comments he writes are 100% illegible. I went to his office hours and he could not even read the comments he wrote on my paper. He also gave me a B on a paper because he thought I used an incomplete sentence and then he realized I didn't but  didn't change my grade. He's a nice enough guy",0
"If u must take this class best advice I can give is to study the book hard bc u will be frustrated trying to understand anything he teaches. He expects his students 2 put more effort in the class w/out anyeffort on his part to improve his teaching methods which is a frustrating attitude ina professor. If u must take this class, dont take itfrom him",0
"Her lectures can be a little boring and tests are iffy, but overall she's a very nice woman who cares a lot about what she does. Would recommend if you need a natural science credit and want to take psych",1
"She is one of the best prof at FIU. They should really hire more professionals like her. She knows the material and likes to answer questions. The class was really interesting. 3 exams, which are not that hard, you get a review for it. There are 4 group assignments, if you have a good group, you should do well. Attendance is mandatory",1
"Dr. Moorhouse is by far one of the most knowledgable people in the health professions college, and in general for that matter. His lectures are wonderful and entertaining, he gives plenty of extra credit and is super caring about all of his students. Anyone saying otherwise must have never spoken to Dr. M!",1
"Holy mother of god her lectures are dry. She goes through millions of powerpoint slides and just endlessly reads them. And if you are waitlisted, you will NOT be added no matter how many empty seats there are. She said she tried to get bigger room? (why? half of class is empty) and because dept turned that down, she couldn't add WL ppl.",0
Our class got a 43% average on the midterm while Alex Crams midterm average was in the 70's .. she doesn't teach you ANYTHING. Midterm exam was horrible.,0
He was a really great professor for the whole semester. Classes during the pandemic are hard but he was always available and answering emails almost right away. Does not give a lot of work to do but to pass you have to make sure to turn in assignments ON TIME and just be aware of everything he posts. Overall easy A and an interesting class.,1
"Best teacher I've ever met at SFSU. Lectures and material are easy to follow, he really makes the material understandable for everyone. Just do the hw and review the PowerPoint, and you will be good on the midterms. I wish I could have another class with Hamed!",1
"Awful guy, would rate 0/5 if I could. He is so rude and inconsiderate. Office hours are a joke. He'll dock you a point every punctuation error on the lab reports.",0
DO NOT TAKE THAT CLASS IF YOU ARE NOT GOOD AT MATH YOU WILL FAIL. MAKES MATH REALLY HARD. SHE TEACHES REALLY FAST AND YOU DONT HAVE A CHANCE TO ASK QUESTIONS. ALSO EXTREMELY TOUGH GRADER. ONE SMALL MISTAKE CAN CAUSE YOU ALL POINTS. DOESNT GIVE YOU EXTRA WORK AND NO MAKEUP. SHE GIVES POP QUIZZES WHICH ONLY ONE STUDENT PASSES FROM THE ENTIRE CLASS.W,0
OK for stats.,1
"Second time having this professor for an online class. This time around, there was ABSOLUTELY NO feedback or communication. I've turned in 25 assignments and completed the final and still not one thing has been graded. Super disappointing considering this is an important class for my major.",0
"He is unorganized in the beginning of the semester (with assignments from last semester's due dates appearing on the to-do list on CANVAS) and will not respond to emails. There is an extra credit opportunity for all of the discussion posts, so take advantage of those, quizzes/exams are difficult. I did not use the book, but it would have helped.",0
"So much reading and memorization for a level 200 course. Quizzes are open book, yet they are built to trick you. The final exam is on all course content which is 15 weeks of slideshows, videos, articles and textbook. Teachers are nice but they don't realize how difficult they made this course especially as an elective. Would not recommend at all.",0
class was pretty easy. attendance was graded and if u were absent more than 4 times u were dropped. class was pretty easy it consisted of reading and taking tests. shouldn't be so hard to pass.,1
"Prof Swift teaches a lot of class in both Cal-Poly Pomona and Claremont 5Cs. As a student in the 5Cs, it is disappointing that the math departments here don't assign him a TA, so we usually don't get feedback on our assignments. But generally, he is good. I like his lectures.",1
Worst professor ever. Checks everything for plagiarism and will tell the dean about you. When you dont understand something he will make sure you know your a failure for it.,0
"Very hard to earn good grades even if you really work on it. Some of her class rules suck!If you don't have a job and can spend tremendous amount of time for the course, you'll probably learn a lot. But if you are working and taking other classes, it can get tough. Very very had to earn an A. Most ppl got C I thnk. I'd look for better options!!",1
very straight foward on tests. If you're  a cram studier you should fine she gives reviews for first 3 tests but 3 days at most before test. last test study all the power points it's a lot I think it was 10 chapters compared to 5 for other lecture tests. lab is easy if you do assignments make copies of it so you have material to study for it.,0
He is one of the best professors at SLU. Take him if you ever get the chance.,1
Very hard class and not useful. The pro is talking nonsense.,0
"SO NICE! Super easy class and Professor Summers truly cares about each of his students, he is very knowledgeable and great at providing opportunities to learn from other nurses who have experience in different fields. He has such a positive attitude and is a great professor!",1
The best math professor that Ferris has to offer for pre-calc. I have struggled with math as long as I can remember. I retook this class cuz I failed with a different professor. He taught me so much that pre-calc became easy for me he is a real gem if you can get him then do it! Even though he offers 8 am classes it's worth it!!!!,1
He honestly should not be teaching math at all. This class is a joke! He is extremely unclear when he teaches and he makes solving problems 10x harder than they actually are. He also freaks out about the smallest things! Avoid taking him.,0
"I thought Dr. Richmond was a nice professor. Only problem, quizzes are only 10 min. and it just wasn't enough time for someone who prefers to use their notes. She does provide you with PowerPoint notes but you cant even look over since its 40+ pages and each question is pretty much under a minute. Discussions and essays were fine.",1
"Professor Christie seems to expect that his class should be above all others. His tests are ridiculously hard, equivalent to an AP Biology of Psychology class and his papers require more writing than an actual writing class. He also doesn't specify what is required for the writing assignments. ",0
"Excellent professor!  Clear expectations, provides study guides, notes and power points, if you study these you will easily pass the quizzes, there are  many opportunities for extra credit. Dr. Anitori keeps lectures interesting, he is funny and explains the subject material clearly with great examples. I highly recommend his course!",1
"Johnson is very opinionated. Her opinions are clear on whats right and wrong, the class isnt based on truth, its based on her own moral objections of right and wrong. At one point she even threatened that if we didnt like it, we could take sociology with the other instructor who shared and would also voice the same opinions.",0
Prof. Zaitsev is a really good Biology Prof. I took him for BIO 110 with lab he dropped the lowest multiple choice test and lab grade. Sometimes he can get a little irritated when people come late and/or don't study but its only because he cares. Be on your toes; make sure you study the class notes gives you; and you should pass. Would recommend.,1
"The driest topic psychology has ever seen is classical conditioning, yet Russ is able to make it the most interesting thing right after Stranger Things. Every week ends in a quiz so prepare yourself for reading. The quiz questions come from the end of chapter quizzes so make flashcards and be sure to learn all of them. A short paper and 2 exams.",1
"Let's start with the fact that he teaches from his own book that he wrote. His presentations were stale and boring and hard to understand, he is also very careless of job oblogations, especially law enforcement. I had to use the tutoring season and I was told by them that he doesn't teach statistics the correct way. Find a different teacher!",0
"Christina doesn't believe in perfection, but she expects it. She is very knowledgeable about color theory and I learned a lot in her class, but I also hated it. She is an extremely tough grader and even if you think you did great, be prepared to have her find AT LEAST one thing wrong with it! She also takes forever (like months) to grade things!",1
"Young is an amazing math teacher. She makes everything so easy and straight to the point! She offers multiple opportunities to get your grade to the grade that you want in the class! If you have to take Math211, I wouldnt recommend any other teacher besides her",1
I highly recommend taking Dr. Reese's online course. He gives you a very clear syllabus with all the dates on it of when everything will be due and all assignments are due on the same dates every week. A few quizzes here and there and one paper. He's also very good at getting back to you when you need to contact him.,1
"His lecture was heavy and did not help my goal to earn from what I've learned in his class. His office hours were a time conflicting with my other class. I asked him to meet at a different time but he refused it. Nothing on the test looked similar to what I've reviewed. Overall, he won't affect me anymore. I will do it better this summer school.",0
This lady is crazy! She doesn't keep on track and often you have no idea what she is saying. She skips a lot of information and expects you to understand it for her exams. The textbook is awesome but she only uses info from her slides which often is different from the textbook. Good luck understanding her in class.,0
"Don't take him as an elective. His class is HARD (so he grades on a curve), and if you don't have much of a biology background then I wouldn't recommend taking his class. As a person, however, he's super nice and caring (although quite scattered - his lectures are all over the place). Overall, nice man, but not a very good teacher.",1
"he really knows the information and can facilitate philosophical discussion well. papers make up most if not all of the grades, so definitely work hard on them. he is super accessible outside of work and cares about your well-being in general and in the class.",1
"Professor Justice is awesome. He has his own blank notes that he posts for discrete mathematics that you can fill in and follow along with in class. His expectations are clear, and he takes his time to answer questions with a calm approach. I highly recommend him to my peers.",1
I would highly recommend taking a different professor for Spanish. She's highly unhelpful if you didn't take a Spanish class the semester prior to taking her class. ,0
Had the worst experience with this Professor. Had a family emergency but he did not care whatsoever and would not reply to my emails. He will make your life harder than it should be. Lots of work and hes very extra.,0
"If you want a teacher who is willing to help you to pass their class, DON'T even think about this one. I passed only due to the heavy work I did for my homework, participation, and quizzes. Exams are HEAVILY weighted for this class. Not to mention communication isn't the best from him. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!!",0
"The ratings are too overstated honestly. I agree that he is a very challenging teacher, especially when he is grading papers, but Professor Rosa is a reasonable man who is very clear on his assignments and the due dates. Overall just do your best on his assignments and you will definitely pass his class. Also he does give homework every night.",1
Great teacher! Fun class and he gives study guides! You do have to work for that A. I would take him again! He usually gives a extra credit opportunity.,1
"I didn't really enjoy the ""old school"" format of the class with lessons on the whiteboard and all. I would have probably liked opre 3360 more. However, this class is super easy and if you show up and take good notes you will definitely get a good grade. He's also super helpful in office hours so meet up with him whenever you have questions.",1
"Completely missed entire units we were supposed to cover. I had her for ENG2 and wrote TWO papers. In ENG1, I wrote 6 papers, that says something. Also have never received a B on a paper until her class, only ever A's. Unfair grader, let's the class take advantage of her, not very helpful/seems annoyed with helping. Unclear expectations. Nice lady",0
"Professor Agol is nice, if a little shy. He will help students who reach out to him. Lectures are mostly clear, but also kind of boring (it doesn't help that class is 80 minutes long), but you don't really need to go to them because he posts slides w his markings online. I hardly felt the need to use the textbook, I wish I'd just torrented a copy.",1
"The Almighty Duba. You clap when this man enters the room... you fricken clap. He hates it when we clap, but we must for our lord and savior. In all seriousness, this man loves his job and loves his class and loves his students. He is just a blast to have as a professor. Could improve on lecturing, but he is enjoyable.",1
Excellent professor! She really takes time to make sure everyone in the class is on the same page. She explains very well and she is always there to help if you need any help understanding the material. Highly recommend her!,1
"She's very patient and if she sees that the class doesn't understand what she's talking about, she goes over it in a different way. She's always willing to help in and out of class. She's also a perfectionist so she will point out where you could do better, but she understands that night classes = busy people.",1
"Her lectures are somewhat interesting, but can be rather boring at times.  She is usually very disorganized and sometimes tells you something and then forgets that she told you.  She is very caring, though, and wants her students to do well.  At times she is not very clear with her feedback on your work and exactly what she expects from you.",0
"Meyer makes you think his class is really easy throughout the quarter, but then he's really obscure about how he grades. Basically, the only feedback I got was A/A- on the midterm and then he dropped an A- on me for the quarter even though I participated and was in class every day.",0
"This professor has real life career experience in journalism, public relations, etc and was incredibly helpful in guiding me toward the right career path for me after graduation! So inspirational. A must-take professor,  if you are interested in a specific career in this field or unsure what you want to do in the field!",1
"Jill was by far one of the greatest teachers I have ever had. She was so encouraging & a great motivator. She wanted to make sure when her students walked out of the class room,they had a clear understanding of the nursing concepts. She made sure it was a stress free & relaxing environment for all. It was a tough course, but very fun & informative.",1
"You must come to class to get points. She gives you too long on projects, specially in the beginning. You sit there trying to drag your work out for three hours. You sign role at the end, so you have to stay. She is kinda crazy, and sometimes blows off your ideas for her own. You only use the wheel once, it's all sculpture. Very boring and dull.",1
"SHOW UP TO CLASS!!!! While I loved her class, showing up was essential. Not only did you miss her lectures but you missed her talking about related subjects and movies that she was showing. Also, if you show up to every class for the semester (and talk to her/ask for help on the final paper) then she will most likely let you out of the final.",1
"Expect to do lots of online homework (sapling) to understand the material being presented, and self teach.",0
horrible...,0
"This class is so cool and interesting! You start by learning about the history of outer space in connection to music but then it progresses to really cool lectures about David Bowie, Pink Floyd, etc.! Jay is a super kind and cool teacher who is extremely understanding and helpful!",1
"I know its the pandemic, but he hasn't taught half of the year and moved the due dates or cancelled half of the work for this class. I was hoping to learn something in this class but feel this was a complete waste of my time. Take him if you want an easy A without having to work for it.",0
"I love Professor Swartz. He is probably one of the best professors I have and ever will have. He was always there to answer questions, but instead of just giving you the answer, he makes you work for it so you learn. Sure he grades tough and he is not the nicest at times, but I learned so much about Chemistry and Chemistry Lab from him.",1
"Dr. Hart's lectures were awful. She went off on tangents that had nothing to do with lecture, and crammed whatever she could when she realized lecture was almost over. Textbook was online which is garbage in for a biology class. Disorganized with quizzes and test questions, including lab. Definitely don't recommend.",0
His speaks very softly and almost monotone so it can be hard to follow along. he knows his stuff but lectures don't seem to go over everything on the tests. His slides are not useful unless you are in class listening to him explain otherwise you might just end up confused.,1
"If you try to get your score back or try to get back the good score then you should give up. If you complete all the exercises and get all the quiz questions correctly, you still not gain much points. But you are wrong 1-2 question, your score will still go down. Extra credit? It doesn't help. She won't believe any reason for late assignment.",0
"I don't understand most of these negative reviews. He is probably one of the best math teachers I have ever had. He breaks down the information well and makes it easy to understand. I honestly think that if all math teachers taught math like him, more people would be better at math.",1
"The textbook she uses is abysmally unhelpful, and all homework is assigned from it. Your only chance to actually learn anything is through the lectures, but she RACES through new material -- you basically only have time to copy down her work and hope to make sense of it later. The class itself is not hard, she's just a terrible teacher.",0
She is the WORST Professor that I have ever had. She sat and read off of the slides. She treats her students like they are little children. She also does not care how you do in the class at all.,0
No visual aid. Hard to hear her lecture. Description of the class is very misleading. Only focused on a very specific vein of activism and movements. Does not always respond to emails. Do not take it unless you are prepared to read numerous several hundred paged books. Absolutely hated this class. This professor is not good.,0
"Jason is a good professor and is clearly passionate about his field, as a psych major I found the content rather difficult and not as exciting as other psych classes. Jason gives good examples to help students learn, and draws the more important diagrams during lecture. The tests make a majority of the grade, but review sessions are held before.",1
"Very good professor. Her slides are good. Lectures are enjoyable, clear and to the point. 4 written HWs and 1 CPU scheduling algorithm programming assignment, all are which were very manageable. Before the class, I thought 143A was gonna be one of the hardest class but turned out to be a very fun class. 100% would recommend this professor.",1
"Nearly absent from course most of semester. Finals week and still no grades/feedback from Oct assignments. Multiple weeks between answered questions by students, some after assignments questions regarded were due. Often unclear expectations of assignments, tough to know what to do. Very little engagement from Kristi this semester. Disappointing...",0
"He is not an easy professor, you have to take a 3.5 hour test and then a quiz as soon as you walk into class. His quiz are very hard, 95% of the class fail them. You have to memorize 3 to 4 chapters and lectures. He is very hard headed and the questions are created to make you fail. He admitted he enjoys making people squirm. Don't recommend",0
Kind of a rude guy and lectures are very boring. The examples he gives are so hard to make sense of half the time and he rambles A LOT. Midterm and Exam aren't hard if you study the old exams he posts online and the assignments.,0
He gave no one in the class an A.,0
"She is all about participation you have no choice. She doesn't like to talk for a long time. She likes everyone else to talk and discuss. But, she is really funny and interesting. All texts are online and free. You will seriously love her class unless you are shy. Plus no midterm or finals! She will make you do a short presentation instead.",1
she is really all over the place when lecturing. notes are hard to take and hard to understand because she goes so fast. I had to find a lot of outside help in this class. she is pretty good about extra credit and letting you turn things in whenever you want though.,0
"She's an amazing professor. I defintely learn a lot from her class and improve a lot more better on writing and checking on my grammars thanks to her.  Although, downside is trying to catch up on your essay, drafts and other stuff but in the end it was worth the challenge and money for this class. i defintely had lots of fun in her class. :) ",1
WARNING: FLIPPED CLASSROOM. Look it up pretty much nothing is done in class(but you have to show up) and all the real learning is done on your own time. This did not work well for most of the class. Averages were in the 40s,0
"Buhler is a basic professor who is out to prove a point. If you really want to learn the concepts, take an online Algorithms course, or just read CLRS by yourself.  You'll learn more and get your money's worth. 541T is not worth the tuition cost or time. If you do take it, be sure to cheat on HW. Everyone else does.",0
"Interesting topics, awesome professor. Draper is definitely among the best of the sociology department faculty. Consistently fair grading and clear guidelines made this course one of my favorites. Exactly what a great college class should be.",1
Gives 4 Essays and 1 final exam hes a very hard grader. All we talked about were poems hes mean and out of 30 students 10 were left at the end of the semester and max 5 passed the class. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS,0
"He is a very helpful professor, who really wants his students to succeed. However, he really wants his students to know their stuff. Plagiarism, half done work, etc. will not fly. That being said, he does everything he can to help you do good work. Very enthusiastic! He really loved what he was talking about, and it made a difference",1
Prof was okay. She's never at her office hrs though. Class was interesting but the TA who does the grading is an ass (will kaufman).  Who counts #of incorrect comma usages and deducts it from your grade?  It's not even an english class!  Isn't content more important than a few grammatical errors?,0
"Hi everyone. I am not usually rated for any of my professors. However, I think you need to know about this one. Homework is extremely heavy. Making sure you have time for it. She grades our work very hard. Trust me, to get a good grade even in a discussion is very difficult.",0
He was very good in my opinion. He had good in class discussions. He was very clear on understanding when things were due and when quizzes and test were. If you go to class you will do just fine.,1
GREAT professor! She is so sweet and willing to do anything for her students. Very easy as long as you do your work. Such a great 3 hour class. I would definitely love to take a class with her again.,1
"He is pretty well versed in his field and clearly wants his students to succeed. The tests are weighted heavily but his lectures are the best resources for studying. I never needed the textbook just his lecture slides to review. Also, make sure to attend the class as there are clicker points.",1
"P. Carter is so funny&great! Easy, no homework. Can only miss 3 classes before grade is reduced. He keeps you laughing and entertained. DEF recommend him to anyone. EASY A! Take him!",1
"Dont take if you care about your mental health and GPA. Run. I really dont know how people give him good ratings, they must only have time for his class. Worst professor ever, shouldnt teach GED classes.",0
"He is a very chill guy. All tests are multiple choice. He has a monotone voice, but other than that he's a typical psych teacher. I recommend him. (: ",0
"She confuses teaching with comedy club, and not even funny. Her French is awful for a French teacher, and she does not seem to care much for actual teaching, with nearly everyone of us getting an A. She is fond of websites and Internet gimmicks. At the end we did not learn much about the topic of medieval studies. Not for me, ever.",0
"Yes, this teacher was very funny. But he was more concerned with quickly cramming   information than going over problems to help the class understand. Answering questions was either hit or miss depending on the amount of topic he had left to cover that day. Maybe not the teaching style that works best for me but I didn't feel like I learned a thing",0
"Dr. Arevalo can neither teach nor speak English sufficiently to make herself understood.  She spends most of class mentioning most of what we will talk about, then rushes through what the students need to have explained to them.  Her tests do not reflect the information she teaches and are worded poorly as she does not have control of English.",0
the bast,1
Dr. Rivas is the best writing Professor at Metro. He grades on process and not grammar!!! Very effective.,1
I absolutely loved Mr. Tyson!! He is hilarious and will go to extremes to explain anything to make sure you understand. Super nice and very respectful. Treats everyone like adults instead of children. Wish he was my professor for every class I take.,1
"I acknowledge he need to work on his English, but at least he needs to prepare some lectures notes or something to make lectures more coherent. He marks hard to the presentation, term paper, and short responses. And presentation and paper take up 45% of total grade! unwilling to help you with paper and presentation ahead. workload is not much",0
"I'm currently taking his class so I will update this later but, so far I hate this class! He uses the excuse of ""hating remote teaching"" to make his class asynchronous like if we don't hate it too. I submitted my work on time and he gave me a zero while I made sure I responded to all the questions he asked. Please Do Not Take This Class!",0
He does not appreciate questions and is very condescending. He promises extra credit but he does not actually put it in the grade book. He does not like enthusiasm for the material so its best to just show up and lay low.,0
"Your gonna enjoy Ultimate Questions FAR more than CHristain Marriage (had him for both)! Pros: his personality and style of teaching. His passionate, open-minded, and funny. His teaching can be moving. Cons: TOO MUCH expectations. He makes you wriet in X style and you can't write in Y style. You have to write summary sentences like in highschool.",1
I loved her class.I took it as a Deck course my freshman 1st semester nd by far my faorite class...the acting techniques and exericses we do are fun and interesting...it helped me come out of my shyness..fav class at Stony,1
"Prof Lohrey leaves everything for you to figure out on your own. Class lectures consist of him flying through ppts, and writing out the solutions to a couple of problems. You should go to class since he goes over probs that are most likely on the test. Two midterms which are 1/2 in class and 1/2 take home, final is in class. Hw on Wiley is helpful.",0
This class sucks. don't take it. you will regret it.,0
"Prof. Renner treats her students like children. Her class is not explicitly difficult and if you read and follow along, you'll do fine, but she simply is not a good instructor. Lectures littered with personal opinions and little backing. Mandatory attendance for a 300 level course. Won't let her students leave to get water during class. Ridiculous.",0
"She might know her stuff, but she builds herself up a lot. She has a high, squeaky voice that's too loud and hard to take for an entire class. Professor Brenan is a much better teacher (Bus 107 and 108).",0
"Worst professor I have ever had, do not take her course. She added no value to the course and I was required to teach myself the material. Some constructive feedback for her, spending the entire class going through problems without any lectures over the necessary concepts is not helpful and only causes confusion. Please add lectures to your courses",0
"Dr. Feige is more of a comedian than a professor. He spends majority of the lecture cracking jokes and ranting about non-class related subjects and there's tons of work. You pretty much have to teach yourself. A plus to taking this course, he has a few labs a week so if you cant make your scheduled class he will allow you to sit in on another lab.",0
"1. 20+ pages per elementary report, any less than that forget about getting above 80 and that's if he doesn't take off 20 points for nth like he always does. 2. Impolite, no professional attitude. 3. the most useless prof ( not sure why he is called so ) in the whole school ( so far ) 4. this dude needs to chill, it's only 1credit. AVOID and REPORT",0
She moves way too fast but she does give the opportunity to ask questions. I studied hours for each test and I couldnt get an A in this class. She takes points off for everything. She gives study guides but her test questions are different than the study guides and her expectations are always unclear. Shell find any reason to take off points,0
"Since her page hasn't been updated in a while, I wanted to add my opinion. Professor Page tended to be condescending towards students and assigned an inordinate amount of busy work. She spoke to us as if we were children, and her attitude made it hard for me to learn in her class. I got an A, but I did not enjoy my experience.",0
"Good prof, He is old fashion and doesn't use lecture slides. Exams are more then fair, he supplies you with a short list of possible short essay questions for review and chooses a select few of those exact questions to be on the exams. Create a google docs with everyone in the class and this course is a easy 80!",1
"Professor Yue is awesome! She pays attention to all her students and takes the time to understand us not only as students, but as individuals. My favorite part of learning in her class is how interesting she makes it (i.e. if we have trouble recognizing a character, she'll tell us a story to help us remember the character itself and its meaning).",1
Pharm online was super easy. I studied exactly what she put on the study guide and got all As on the quizzes. Follow exactly what she ask for with discussion post and you will get 100. Take this professor for whatever classes that you can !,1
"I took PHIL 124 over the summer and it was an easy A. There was a discussion and a quiz every week. There were two required books and they were cheap. I actually really enjoyed the content but you might not be into it if you're not interested in poems, Asian/Indian history, and Hinduism/Confucianism. Never interacted with the professor, just peers.",1
"One of the worst professors/teachers I've ever had. Sarcastic, rude, and condescending. Tough grader but also takes a long time to post grades so it's hard to know how well you're doing. Do not take her class unless you have to.",0
"Very lazy professor, have him 2 times a week. On the monday or tuesday class we spend half the time watching videos submitted by students explaining a problem from the hw which is a waste of time. The other day of his class he sends out pre recorded lectures. If I had to describe him in one word I would struggle deciding between lazy or disengaged.",0
"She gives pop quizzes to prepare you. She does not play. She works hard and expects you to be there, on time, and prepared. She scared me at first but then became my favorite professor. She does not spoon-feed you but gets you ready for the bar. I have huge respect for her and her teaching method. She keeps it real and sets a high bar.",1
Knows her stuff but is no joke! Very rewarding class.,1
"Do not take a class with this professor. Worse grade I've ever gotten, most of my classmates dropped the course prior to the end (now I know why). Does not explain things well, slow grader, accusatory. I will never take a course with this instructor again, & I would recommend you don't either!",0
Boring,0
"So half the time she doesn't ever know what she's teaching us. We ask her a question and she says ""Uhm, let me think about that for a second... nope I don't really have an answer for you. Sorry."" How professional. We also wasted a lot of time in class talking about stuff in her slides that she ended up saying is not important to the test. AVOID HER",0
She is indeed rude on email. Everything is online. You study by yourself and take the exams online. The Examity she used doesnt work sometimes. And I missed the midterm for some tech issues. Not recommended!,0
"Sanchez is really nice and teaches alot of interesting material but in the end, you'll feel as if you've learned nothing. This course doesn't help at all with speaking of the language. Tests are a joke. They're online and basically a google scavenger hunt with a time limit. Grades pretty fairly but takes forever in doing so.",0
A really fun guy that will not hold you back at all. He's very happy to help you out if you ask him and gives out a good amount of extra credit. A pretty good professor from the classes that I've had with him. He knows the material pretty well and you can go up to him with questions if you have them.,1
"She genuinely cares about her students. Offers a lot of extra credit. In class we go over powerpoints, there are no in-class assignments or homework. The powerpoints are posted on D2L. Only grades you will have are tests, they are pretty easy. I love her she is the sweetest woman, I definitely recommend this class!",1
"Her class consists of talking an excessive amount about phallic symbols, being interrupted by her multiple times everytime you speak, and trying to understand her (which is difficult) whether it be due to her accent, terrible grammar, or flawed logic.",0
"Great teacher. Took 3 classes with him and I was the only female, but I always felt included. Asks for the same passion from his students that he gives as a teacher. VERY motivational and accessible. Never makes you feel bad for asking questions. Tough class but worth taking. Probably wouldn't have stayed in networking if it weren't for him.",1
"Awful. Not an English class. Take this class if you want to debate and hate the gov't. Discuss and talk about imaginary aliens that would ""rape every orifice"" on you. The government is out to get us and everyone is racist. There was NO structure on what he expected from papers. His feedback is condescending and unhelpful. Not encouraging/inspiring.",0
"He's incredibly boring and the material was dry. Read off his notes most of the time and attempted to make it interesting sometimes but not very well.. Could have taught myself better. Tests were pretty straightforward. Makes you use Connect which sucks, but it's pretty easy. Probably wouldn't take him again.",0
I miss him.  I wish I could have worked with him more.,1
PLEASE DO NOT TAKE HER. She is by far the worst professor i've ever taken. No one in my lab passes with an A. Her averages on her lab quizzes were always 6/10. Her lab quizzes are extremely hard and she's a tough grader when it comes to lab reports.,0
"Shows up 15-30 mins late to EVERY lecture, and wastes your time. Tests are nothing like what is covered in class or in the 2 hw sets. Lectures are scattered and make no sense. I'll get an A, but I didn't learn anything from this professor. I'm a 4.0 masters student, and Sina is the worst professor I've ever had. He's gonna need a new job soon!",0
"David Englund cares about Econ but is not a good teacher. He uses tricky clicker questions to lower your grade. No homework, 4 tests and the final. Dont buy the book.",0
He is awesome!! I would take him again if I could!! Makes it so much fun yet still teaches! Homework is basically extra credit on test and extra credit you can earn up to 15 points and its just going to theater shows or chior concerts. Hes so awesome anyone is lucky to take him hes so cool and a great teacher overall. He cares alot,1
Took her maternal/infant health class and wouldn't recommend a better professor to have class with! Had 2 exams (super super easy) a final paper and a class presentation. Take her if you can!! You are guaranteed an A!,1
"A very fair and knowledgeable professor. Mainly a discussion based class, but people aren't forced to participate if they don't want to, although it helps with participation grades. I do feel like I learn a lot in the class, and he's a really nice person. Lots of reading though, mainly reading based. There are writing assignments but not a ton.",1
"Pretty bad at teaching. At first I thought it was her first time teaching or maybe its the first time in this subject. However she has a PhD, MBA, and a MEd. I don't recommend her for this class. She knows her stuff and is probably good for other courses.",0
"He is ready to help but doesn't really help. He is too specific about everything and writes wrong emails every time he sends out an email or posts something on CC. After taking his class, I feel I lost confidence in Biology although that's my major.",0
Not sure what to say. He is a nice person but does not know how to teach well. ,0
"You should only expect an A in this class if you show up to every single class and are incredibly engaged. Don't be deceived by the .5 credit: there are many writing assignments and ""Engagement activities"" over the course of the semester (standard for all dance at duke?). This class was more of an extra academic burden than a dance class for me.",0
"Amazing class. Actually made money off the skills I learned from Garver. If you want to understand what quality audio really is, this is the guy.",1
Very easy gen ed. Just do the homework and its an easy A,1
"Best Professor Ever, Very interesting class and He definitely knows his materials",1
"he is extremely hard for no reason and when you try your best, he makes you feel like a failure. i do not recommend him at all.",0
"Not a nice person or teacher. Very rude and condescending, always felt like I was bothering her when asking a question. She was rude to me and other's the first day, plus very late for class.  How could they keep her on at school with the bad remarks, I have read while making my own bad remarks on her? I dropped out because of her.",0
She was a difficult teacher to have. Don't plan on taking her class if you don't want to spend all weekend long on homework. I'm not kidding. If you are really good at accounting then it would probably take less time. The homework is online and difficult to understand.,0
Not a hard teacher. Her classes are not a big deal. Nice lady.,1
"She will break you. Side note, her wardrobe: pristine. Paulet is fond of calling her 210 History major's boot camp and it really is a break down, build you up sort of class. Can smell fear.",1
"She is an awesome professor! I love when she teaches class, she knows what she is doing, and she keeps things fun and interesting. The class is difficult, but as long as you do your part, she'll do hers!",1
"Ryan is funny and entertaining, and his lectures on creativity are interesting. However, in person, Ryan can be condescending and critical. Sometimes, criticism is constructive and based on facts. Other times, he just has his own opinion of how things should work. Frequently made me feel stupid in emails. Just be tougher than he is.",1
"Paul was frivolous and arbitrary in his criticisms and unhelpful with our projects. Instead of teaching a material, he told us what to use and gave a brief demo in equipment. We ended up having to get around using the material instead of mastering it. His assignments were obscure.",0
"The lectures are packed with information yet she talks too fast for any notes to be taken. Also if you ask an honest question in a lab, be prepared for a rude and condescending response. It is not impossible to do well in the class but you'll be given a terrible experience the entire time.",0
"She was the professor that made me change my major to Criminal Justice. She is so kind and will elaborate on any subject until you understand. There are 3 tests online that are multiple choice, and weekly worksheets online to do. If you show up and listen, this class is great! I would love to have her again!",1
"This is the most interesting class I have taken in this program.  A nice blend of health economics and health care policy. Economics is not easy, and requires a lot of studying, but its worth the effort",1
SUPER boring lectures. Probably the worst lectures I've ever attended.,0
"I took this class as a session A so it was very fast paced. Every 5 days there was discussion posts, a quiz, and a 'media critique' due. There would be a few readings per module and videos (some videos are documentaries so don't wait until the last minute to watch them). The media critiques are 250 words minimum and quiz are around 15 questions.",1
"Not helpful. Extremely Hard marker with stupid multiple choice selections like ""C. None of the above D. None of them apply"". Makes you do your whole group project on D2L which is extremely inconvenient and inefficient. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS.",0
"Dr. Szto does not accept late assignments. I was in his mental health course and did not feel that he prioritized the mental health of students. Found he was condescending to classmates and I who had meetings with him. Since I had the ability to choose which extra social work course I wanted to take, I wish I had taken a different class.",0
"I took the online summer course and I knew it would be challenging. But I didn't think it would feel impossible. There is an extreme amount of homework given. I'd say take this course from this professor only if math comes easily to you, and if you can devote 25-30 hours a week to work on it.",0
If you are not good at math do NOT take him. He skips a lot of steps he feels are common sense but for those of us not good at math are important to understand the material. Quizzes every week. Doesn't answer questions thoroughly. I never felt comfortable enough to ask questions because of the way he responded to others when they asked.,0
Unnecessarily strict with grading. Gives poor feedback with little to no reasons as to why a low grade was given.,0
Probably the worst experience i had in this college was with this professor. Proceed with extreme caution!,0
"Hands-down the worst professor I've ever had. She grades everything harshly and is merciless. She should be fired but the CS dept takes what they can get at this point. Nothing in CS252 makes any sense. She also thinks she's so funny, but she ain't. Do NOT take this class if you don't have to. If you do, good luck comrade.",0
"Throughout my 4 years at SJSU, this class with Professor Pearce wins the award for teaching me the most amount of useless crap. SWE majors, there are much better technical electives you can take that will actually help you land a job in the real world- unlike the useless crap taught here.",0
"great guy, but very poor at communicating when assignments are due and poor at giving details about the assignments. I'd rate him a 5, 5 out of 10.",0
"If you can't make it to class on time don't even bother showing up or taking his course. He will make a huge deal about it. Have to use the bathroom or leave the room for a minute? - DONT BOTHER. He will call you out on it and make a huge deal. He lectures the whole class time and goes over and will not let you leave! AWFUL ""teacher""",0
She needs to care more about students.,0
"she tries her best to teach despite in pandemic situation and she values students who truly wants to learn chemistry. To past this class, you need a group of friends that you can work with. She gives out powerpoints which have some practice into it. Though, it is not as useful as her own review sheet.",1
"she's a cool person, but she tends to ask for too much from an ACA class. Like its a 1 credit class and she doesnt understand some people's circumstances. So i'll be a tough rater, like she's a tough grader.",0
"He is totally useless. Plain and simple. I never solves the examples, just gives you the formula then the answer and says solve it after class. Completely useless, worst professor I've had in all my three years.",0
"He's clearly very knowledgeable about the subjects he's teaching and cares about his students. I'm one to skip class, but you really do need to attend to get a good grade. As long as your there and pay attention, the class isn't hard. He also gives plenty of extra credit on the quizzes. I would recommend him to anyone taking intro biology.",1
It's one thing to know the world of philosophy and it's another to know pop culture and think it's the path to understanding. Gentry is as shallow and unoriginal as I've ever taken. Very disappointed and wish I could get my money refunded.,0
"Professor Liggin is an amazing professor. The lectures are exciting. attendance is not mandatory but if you skip class, you won't pass. Professor has a bold sense of humor that will keep the class engage if you have questions ask he will answer!!!! Take him, best professor",1
"Nemat is a very engaging professor. He is one of the few engineering professors I have had who truly cares to spend time making sure the students understand the material, absolutely. He will tend to spend times on material that seems simple, however, it is with good reason. FUNNY which is great for eng. class. Exams very close to HW & pract. ones.",1
Good professor if you want to really learn Biology. I enjoyed the course and I wish she was teaching part 2. I feel extremely prepared in my area since I am a Bio major.,1
"Very laid back, but when push comes to shove, not all that interested in his students.  Would not take again.",0
"She's tough. I'm trying to be optimistic about the class and how strict she is, but its hard. I guess if you think of it as she's trying to make you a better writer, you'll see through. My struggle is if I'm not the best at writing, that's why I enrolled, how will being tough without actual correction help me overcome? Her feedback is a dead end.",0
One of the best professors! He is caring to his students and is always willing to answer questions. The tests are fairly easy as long as you show up to class. You will need the book that is suggested to pass. I would take him again!,1
"Don't buy the books, rent them just get copies of the Leopold articles it will save you some $$. Attendance is not mandatory but you will miss some important notes. The group activitis, the bus tour and the game are fun. I learned a lot. Exams are hard. Lots of reading and must be organized for this class.",1
"Let me preface this by saying I majored in Math and have gotten A's on all previously math classes. I took his Calculus III online math class in 8 weeks, and it is downright impossible. His ""notes"" is just copy/paste from the textbook, and that's it. It really seems he has no idea about Calc III, and conversely, his students have no idea either.",0
"Mr. Wilbrandt is by far the best teacher I've had at Auburn. I feel like he cares a lot about the way students learn in his class and is exceptional in explaining most of the information and if something isn't clear, he always happily goes into further detail at the end of class. He also holds study sessions before exams. Exceptional!",1
"WORST TEACHER AT NASHVILLE STATE! Doesn't enter grades at all, claims he only gives a final grade and you are suppose to keep up with your own grades to know if your're passing. Takes the fun out of art! Does the same thing every single class!!! He talks with terrible language and bad body language and uses profanity, which is so unnecessary!",0
"i'm a 300 level student, i passed all the courses before, and my gpa was 2.9 UNTIL I TOOK THIS GUY'S LING100. I never seen a 100 level can contain so many materials, 2 difficult midterms worth 60%, and our class average was C!!!! It means half of my classmates got a grade below C ....",0
"He doesnt teach at all. Goes over the homework and talks about how phones and technology is destroying our generation. Hes not hard to pass tho, just do the work and youll be fine. Id only take him for 304 tho, I wouldnt take him for 401 or 404 because I heard hes worse. Good luck if you take him",0
"He has a tendancy to get off the topic sometimes, but more often than not, his lectures were interesting.  Translation quizzes were easy and papers weren't too long.",1
The most caring profesora in the department.  She can be very strict but she will work with you to excel not only in your class but also in your desire to be fluent in Spanish.  You have to do your homework and focus in class.  I just wish all teachers were like her .  I highly recommend her. She is a darling!,1
"This guy has a HUGE ego and it shows. He also claims he will confiscate your phone if it is found to even be on during his class. When asked if the exception would be made if the student is a first responder (EMT, firefighter, police officer, etc.) who is on call, he says you should just take a different class. It even says this in his syllabus.",0
Prof was cool but he reads off the powerpoint that he provides.,1
"We are currently a month into class and I don't think the class as a whole is keeping up. We had a journal entry due today and when she asked who *didn't* turn it in, 80% of the class raised their hand. This is not a class problem, but a failure on the part of the professor to properly communicate what is due. already dreading the rest of the year",0
"Nice guy but treats Intro 101 class more as a master's class. Too much material covered & ""study guides"" are just lists of what's possibly on tests; did not include what he's specifically looking for, which is relevant bc there's so much side material that you lose site of what he's considering the main points. Low class test scores so not just me",0
This professor is so funny and his lectures are super engaging while adding to the class material. The class was based entirely on 3 exams all of which were take home and short answer essay question based. I learned a lot in this class and enjoyed learning it. Amazing course.,1
"Obviously the student who complains about the recommended books does not read. I read the books recommended by the professor. Some have changed my life. He teaches with a level of enthusiasm I've not seen before. He grades grammar, and those who complain do not know proper English. Really, after 4 years at WSU? I appreciate Dr. Alderete. Thank you.",1
Horrible teacher! Don't know why csun hired this man! Gave us 2 midterms one we never got back to see our score! He then never graded our homework! His lectures he gets from another teacher and takes an 1:15 to do one problem! Sucks at calculus and screws up every problem he does! Your process may be right but he won't give you any partial credit,0
"Dr. Keralis has a very laid back personality, & seems easy going. His weekly quizzes however are a joke, never stating the quiz questions could have more than one answer until a student pointed it out in class (halfway thru the semester), which he shrugged off. If you don't read & beat the material into your skull, you won't pass. DO NO TAKE!",0
"This is from Longridge: ""Q: Is there a way to view my Final Exam to verify which ones I answered  incorrectly?  A: Your FINAL exam is a TEST and NOT a learning experience. As such permission to review finals is NOT given."" Her reasoning is terrible. She's not giving students opportunities to learn where they went wrong; she must be right.",0
"Dr. Boden knows his stuff and is very passionate about Geology. The 101 class is, lets just say intense. if you pass the class you will know much more than the standard GEOL 101 student. that being said, pay attention, memorize the stuff and stick it out. It's a hard class, but prioritize it and you'll probably be fine.",1
"This professor is a treasure trove of experience and knowledge in Social Work. A few other students have said that she can come across somewhat intimidating or difficult to read. However, I have found her to be a very caring and precise individual. Get ready to be consistently prompted to explain your understanding in your own words.",1
the way she thinks is so ridiculous. I can hardly believe that I willingly signed up for such a class. She also sometimes thinks that your not right when in reality you are.,0
she is really bad...she didnt help me at all...the class was a waste of money and time. dont take her class.,0
"Really enjoying the class so far! Made a C on the first exam, but got an A on the last one... Reviewing with a group paid off! My suggestion: attend every class, read the chapters (they just reinforce what was said in class) and read his exam questions THOROUGHLY! He's a trickster, but a brilliant man. Love all of his stories and corny jokes.",1
"Took his CS 220 class, and Intro to Algorithms class.  Worst teacher I've ever had.  He threw me out of his office hours once, because he didn't like that I missed class that day.  Doesn't speak English well at all.  You won't learn a thing in his class.  Drop, immediately.",0
"In the beginning of the semester, the class was OK. However, after she got into a car wreck, it was terrible. She did not follow the syllabus at all, class was always cancelled, and grades were never entered in Canvas. Also, instead of putting a midterm grade in, she gave me a B for my final grade, even thought it was in the middle of the semester.",0
"African-Americans in film ... don't take this class. most of the time we get out early, but class discussions are 5 minutes long and mostly consist of him saying the same things about one movie as the previous one. The book is good. won't learn much. harsh paper grader",0
"Robert Mustard is without a doubt a terrible teacher. He tries to throw everything at students, confuses them on tests and puts unexpected questions. He purposely wants his students to fail. Please do not take him. he always puts on a fake smile in front of everyone. He throws curveballs on tests. Please avoid this man, I just want to help everyone",0
"The class and material were confusing but the professor was extremely helpful and understanding. She grades based on a curve and as long as you do all the work the worst grade you can get is a B- There are several quizzes and a final (no midterm) and 10-11 labs. Overall, great professor and genuinely cares about her students. Definitely recommend",1
This is the best class I've taken so far at FSCJ. I looked forward to every class. This guy is a really good teacher. Highly recommended.,1
She's a great professor. She really helped out the students and encouraged participation and creativitiy. She's got a great sense of humor and is very approachable. She cares that you understand material and apply it to what you read. Highly recommended!,1
"He was really generous with his time and willing to help with my essay drafts outside of class. His lectures in class and comments on essays are helpful too. I have a much better idea of what I'm doing in research papers now. Covid kind of messed up the semester because there wasn't class time to ask questions, but he was still easy to email.",1
"This professor, and the TA, both choose which parts of the readings they consider fact. Multiple quizzes I had correct answers and quizzes from both the reading and lecture but missed the points because, in their opinion (never shared with class) they were not the most important. Would not take again.",0
"Don't take this class. I took this class online and the tests had nothing to do with the lecture plan or the notes she provided. Also, I would turn in my assignments on time and she stated that she did not receive them by the due date and not give me credit for the assignments, even if I gave her proof that they were submitted on time. Never again!",0
"I've been taking English 102 with Professor Robertson and have found the course load in this class to be ridiculous. For being a general education requirement, the work is hard, tedious, and unnecessary. The deadlines change often, and not enough time is given to complete projects. I do not recommend taking any class from this professor.",0
She's the sweetest professor I've ever had. Her class was really interesting and she made it so you were engaged. The interviews/ projects were simple and fun. You will defiantly have to get the book. She basically gives you the test as the study guide and lets you bring in an index card as a cheat sheet. Homework every class but it's easy.,1
Awful,0
Prof was pleasant and entertaining. Made class fun. would take more classes with her,1
"Loved having Jon as a professor. Easy A if you show up and do your work. Great guy, curses a lot more in class than any professor that I have had, but he's a funny guy.",1
"Print out his PPT, go to class, fill in the missing parts, and do the homework. Test questions are like some of the homework and some of the group work. Grading: he works the problem with you, so even if you picked the wrong approach, you get partial credit for having done the work right. He has a Q&A day before tests - ask questions!",1
"This is an online class for which BYUI has already prepared all the coursework, therefore all assignments and tests are the same no matter who your prof is. Having said that, Prof. Gallini is friendly and always helped  whenever I had a question about the subject material or how to do a particular assignment.",1
"I love Professor Lusk! While her classes tend to be pretty lecture heavy, I generally don't get bored listening to her. Her lectures are honestly quite thought provoking and interesting. She tells stories that make her lessons pretty applicable. Don't skip her class, I relied a lot on what I learned in class for tests. Also she grades pretty easy.",1
"Worst professor I've ever had. Blames students for bad exam grades, never returned any of project grades. Nobody knew how they were doing in the class until the final grades were posted.",0
"I had this prof. for Spring of 2020 and he very difficult to reach through email. He was very confusing, and unhelpful. Unless you had previous background in it like I did, you will most likely struggle. I had to guide quite a few students through the material. Some were promised regrades but did not get a response at all towards the last few days",0
She is Awesome. As long as you do your work and participate you will get along great with her. She strives for hard workers and is really fun to be around. She will play music of your choice during breaks and while waiting for class to start.,1
"Lutfi's lectures are unorganized, boring, and he tends to ramble on. Went to his office hours and he was kind of rude, but in lecture he seems nice. Didn't do well on the tests personally, but the tests were mainly just definitions, so if you study for them, you should do fine. Don't buy the book, totally unnecessary. ",0
Lazy Professor! All she does is giving you a load of readings and then have the class talk about it while she just stands there and literally nods to everything. It is honestly pathetic! There is only 3 assignments that make your grade or break it. All based off a book and articles. It is really annoying & there is no real class engagement!,0
Your whole grade in the class is based on tests and quizzes and there are no study guides. She does offer office hours if you dont understand but she is kinda standoffish. Hard class dont take,0
Dr. Maillert couldn't have been less interested in teaching this class. She always seems bored and never wants to help students. I could have read the textbook upside and it would have helped more. The problems are dumb and all refer to a previous problem and then that problem refers to another problem so each question takes 3 other problems.,0
"If you showed up and paid attention, everything was very simple. Makes it very easy for you to understand. Great teacher",1
"I found Joy's class very difficult. The readings were super challenging, the material was generally boring. She would give us long assignments that are worth 2-5%. She doesn't seem to care about the student's time. Also, she is a very tough grader with minimal feedback. I cried during the midterm and almost dropped out twice. Avoid if you can!",0
Definitely one of the more easier classes I've had. Prof. Reese definitely makes the class fun and the information is much easier to digest this way. Would definitely recommend. Wished I could add more tags to my rating.,1
"Professor Eda Persampieri cares about her students. It is an easy A if you show up, complete your homework, and her two projects. There is a individual project, and a group project which is 60% of your grade combined. Her lectures are easy to understand, and she offers extra credit and her homework is mostly based on a textbook chapter.",1
"If you can understand what he is saying, you'll wish you didn't.",0
"crazy long papers, lectures are awful and there is random class work that is graded, tests are abnormally hard for a teacher who literally just reads off a powerpoint all class.",0
"He is a beautiful creature and incredibly nice! He's very clear with his explanation and encourages everyone to engage with each other hence why it's a Marketing course. I just didn't like how we needed to group ourselves the 2nd class because we hardly knew anyone but it is a good way of exercising networking skills. Also, doesn't post his notes.",1
Always makes sure to let you know when there will be a pop quiz and is helpful when studying for the exam,1
"If you want an easy A, take Caruso. Funny, energetic guy who isn't afraid to speak his mind on crazy things. Lectures are often his coverage of the material along with class input. Tells you what you need to know for the tests, of which there are only a few that he lets you use your notes for. Get ready for a fun, entertaining class.",1
An amazing professor!  I wish there were more profs like her!  Very clear expectations.  No surprises.  Clear and concise.  Personally I think you have to have an IQ below room temperature to fail her lecture class or just truly not care...  ,1
Lectures are hard to follow and she sidetracks a lot. Very unclear grading criteria on assignments. Prepare to read upfront!,0
"This was the best online class ever. She encourages you to use the book and notes as all the quizzes, exams and final is open book. She's very laid back and gives good feedback on discussions. The deadlines are very clear and organized. Even during a pandemic, she was so kind and understanding!",1
Rambles a bit during class and goes off the subject a little too much. Not very organized just reads off the powerpoint and gives the test from teachers cd. Doesnt put much effort into it. He is very nice willing to help if you ask. Average teacher.,1
Doesnt provide help and your whole grade is based upon your test and quiz scores which she doesnt provide much help with. IF YOU HAVE TO TAKE THIS CLASS CHOOSE ANOTHER TEACHER. One person in my class got an A 8 people had Bs and the rest failed. More than 60% of the class got D's or F's. Bad teaching. she ruined my college career,0
"I took BIO101 and it was quite possibly one of the worst classes I have ever taken. It is extremely exam heavy and does not offer open note. No lectures, book is completely online, and it is a weighted course. Where the exams are 45% of your grade. Absolutely ridiculous. I would have dropped the class if it was not required to graduate.",0
Need to work hard and do lots of practice problems. But she's an excellent professor and she explains well and does good examples.,1
"She makes Chemistry EASY. Print power points, read them before class, and you will have no problem following along and passing. Exams are easy if you study power points. She presents material in a way anyone can understand, builds upon material to the next subject which is helpful, and very laid back. Extra credit opportunities. Homework is rare.",1
"I think Professor Wolverton is a really great professor, but her teaching style is for a very specific student. I love history, but she lectures using ONLY HER NOTES AND A CHALKBOARD, and for me personally that was super dry. The feedback on papers/exams was minimal, study guides she gave out were good, readings were dense/long.",1
"I enjoyed this class as well as the professor. I was dreading taking this class after reading all these negative reviews but honestly, it was great class. I learned a lot and it wasn't any harder than some of the other online classes I've taken. The class was very organized and straightforward.  Do the work and you'll get a decent grade.",1
"He is very thorough in his grading and will not refrain from commenting on the littlest detail, which personally I found very instructive. His lecturing is sufficiently interesting and informative, however, he does tend to dwell on historical background more often than not. Notwithstanding, he is very good at explaining philosophical concepts.",1
"very bad teacher , no examples",0
LOVE LOVE LOVE Dr. Buchoff!!! She is so sweet and really wants her students to succeed. As long as you show up to class and do all of the assignments you will get a good grade in her class.,1
Man is awful at teaching i dont even want to rant. believe me or not but get ready to read the book,0
"She is definitely passionate about polisci. Definitely do the reading as much as you can and HAVE A STUDY GROUP. It will make things more easier if you have a study group. I won't lie, the work does seem extra at times but, you will definitely learn in her class, so that I give her credit from.",1
"In-class assignments&homework don't always prepare you for the tests, which are the only grades in the class. By semester's end, the gap bt students who understand the material&who fall behind is wide as Hadavas doesn't focus on those confused in order to help them better understand the material-he waits for someone to state the answer & moves on.",0
I really enjoyed Darwin and this class.  He has a dry sense of humor and always slips it into every lecture.  His exams really aren't that hard as long as you review all of the material the night before; they're definitely not set up to trick you.  I would definitely take Darwin again if I had the chance!,1
"Dr. Clasen has not impressed me. His ""lectures"" are just him reading slides. He was responsive at the beginning of the class, but then he just disappeared. Lots of assignments; it's a summer class so it's 3-5 ch/wk and no feedback on any homework and rarely on tests either. YouTube is a better teacher!!! He does give extra credit, which is nice.",0
"A very tough grader, Very strict always speeds through things. In this course you mostly have to teach yourself to understand what he's talking about, wants you to read the chapter before coming to class.",0
He says it like it is. He provides interesting lectures. All you have to do is raise your hand at least once a class and you will get an A.,1
"Professor Dunham is by far my favorite professor. He teaches everything you need to know in class, is available for students if they need help. There is no homework but online quizzes. I had to take this class again and the change in professor made such a difference!",1
"Just don't take her. She doesn't respond to emails ever, she only reads from the book, her tests are completely ridiculous. I read the book, got a tutor, and still couldn't get an A.",0
She really cared about our mental well-being as a class. The discussions were great and I felt like my opinions were valid and she knows what she is talking about. She is super sympathetic and welcomes any questions.,1
One of the BEST professors at ELAC!!! If you aren't too well at Math I suggest to take her. Very understandable and patient. Test are really similar to the review. The homework is a lot but it helps with remembering the material. Her lectures are the best and the notes are really easy and understandable.,1
I am not sure what the bad comments are about.  Ms G came in with a day's notice and tried to make a terrible class somewhat entertaining.  She is funny and doesn't read the power point slides and encourages you to think.  ,1
"Teacher covers all the assignments in class. She challenges you with extra work in class and gives extra credit for it. Test are open book, doing several programs. You have to know your stuff!! But if you like programming this is the way to go.She uses an online package to submit all the work we do in class. I recommend this teacher.",0
One of the best professors I have had. Very fair and prepares you for the exams. Study over all hw and quizzes and you'll do fine on the exams.   He made the class so much more enjoyable,1
"She openly admits to not being good at lecturing and it shows quickly. She clearly has experience but she can't form the sentences to properly share her knowledge. Nice woman, kind of funny, but it does not make up for her flaws. We had one big group project that was near impossible. Tests suck too. Quit now.",0
"prof. ortiz was a very sweet professor. She knows what it's like to be a student and how it's hard to manage paper work. She was ok with you handing in work late, but don't take advantage of it, her paper work is easy, so there's no reason for it to be late. her class may seem boring, but if you do the reading and participate, it's interesting/fun",1
"Awful, currently in the class right now & cant stand it. Shes extremely rude to students who ask multiple questions. She zooms through showing the class the steps to learn & solve the problems because she can enter everything in excel & use function buttons. Requires you to listen to her online lecture as well lots of homework. WCCCD needs new prof",0
"Very nice guy but learned next to nothing in this class. He made sure everyone's grades turned out alright with 4 take home quizes, 2 take-home exams, and an open-note test but feeling like I'll be spending lots of time in the tutor center for CHM 102.",0
"This guy teaches a communication class and LITERALLY does not know how to communicate. He has never once responded to one of my emails, talks like a textbook and his lectures are pointless. He seriously over complicates so many things. For example, the term ""interpersonal communication"" seems confusing when he describes it.",0
"Not helpful at all.  Don't even think about asking questions, will react to you like you are stupid. Very boring teacher. Not recommended at all!",0
Doesn't really make an effort to help you improve.  Group critique sections are kind of useful but unfocused.  He provides almost nonexistent feedback until you get your grade.  You pretty much have to hound him for input.,0
"He gives you everything you need to pass his course on black board,ie recorded lectures, notes practice problems and is very helpful during office hours. You will not pass if you dont put in effort",1
Flashback to Elementary school. Easiest class I've ever taken. The most boring and irritating class I've ever taken. Avoid her at all costs.,0
"Grade is based on online work, a group project, online open notes exams, and showing up to class. Very easy class as long as you dont fall behind. Very chill and understanding teacher.",1
Tom is the reason I started to love math ;),1
"She has made so may people i know cry and try to ruin their careers because she has a horrible habit of choosing who she likes and hates. She hates most girls. She has always been great to me, but when she treats my peers so poorly its hard to think she's genuine.",0
"She was a nice lady and the class was easy, but many assignments seemed kind of pointless. They didn't add to the understanding of the subject.",1
"Professor Dutta made the transition to online classes bearable. He provided clear instructions, provided well-thought out lectures and materials, and gave a lot of partial credits. He is considerate to students' feedback. It's not an easy class as it deals with SQL and Visio, but as long as you put in the work and attend lectures, you'll be golden!",1
Horrible. She is hard to understand and her grading is ridiculous. She has no sympathy and does not care if your not doing good. Barely gives any practice problems. Grades after the curve were still in the 50-60% range. Avoid at all cost.,0
"Dr. McKenzie was a great teacher to have if you're not good at science (like myself). He does a good job of explaining things in a way that you understand. All of his final grade is based on tests, which are 50 multiple choice questions. If you skip lectures often, you better read the book and make it up.",1
"Page is SO knowledgeable! She shares so much insight. You will learn so much every class. There are lots of projects and assignments, but you learn a ton!!",1
He is very clear on what will be on the test. He makes it easy to take notes while he lectures and you should study your notes before the test and you will be fine. He gives a test review and tells you what to study to do well on the test. Definitely a manageable A,1
"Very sweet woman but a bad teacher. I've found myself sitting in class looking at her with my mouth open and my brain being fried by the confusion. she understands that we don't speak Spanish fluently, so she teaches ONLY in Spanish. yea... not good. needless to say, i have 3 classes left and can't even imagine if Ive passed or failed. ",0
THIS PROF. WAS NOT IN CLASS ALMOST THE ENTIRE SEMESTER.  HIS EXAM IS NOT HARD; YOU DO NOT LEARN ANYTHING WITH THIS PROF.  THIS PROF. KNOWS ALOT ABOUT POLICE SCIENCE BUT IT IS HARD TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HE IS TALKING ABOUT.,0
"If you learn well from a teacher who sits behind a projector all class, scribbling on paper, she's your lady.  Half the time you could barely see what she was writing when she was going through examples. Horrible class.",0
Theres daily readings for about 1/4 of the given book. Lectures were given by student instead of her. You may even be able to plagiarize as she lets it slide. Nothing is posted online so dont expect to keep track of it. Never went off the syllabus.,0
"Just posting so you all are warned. Take another prof. Dr. Wigginton is super judgmental and rude especially if you ask questions or dont understand her examples. She cancelled class 6 times all last minute, twice before the midterm, and expected us to teach ourselves based on the textbook only. No study guide and doesnt follow the syllabus.",0
"Literally all you do in class is sit on the computer and struggle with learning using the ALEKS program while she walks around the class. She doesn't teach at all, you have to teach yourself online.",0
she just hands out A's,0
"Very hard, lots of reading. Lectures are really boring...he tends he go off on tangents alot. Thought I was in a history class, not an english class half the time. Very critical when grading essays. Take another teacher if you can.",0
"He gives you a good presentation and you have some time to use your note during the test. However, there is a lot of pop quiz during his class and you cannot use your note on that. His grading system is different. He doesn't grade based on percentage. he grades on based how much points that you get",1
"lectures are 3 hours and most of the lecture is examples of examples without examples lecture are an hour He is a harsh grader he does make a study guide for quizzes He makes his test straight from the N+ textbook He has ridiculous turn in times, sometimes 2 weeks others 3 days He doesn't give you any lab time, you have to go to the lab on your own",0
He is very convincing when it comes to acting as if he has no idea what students are up to. He is a very good writing teacher. I was able to improve my writing skills drastically through his Humanities course.,1
"Professor Douglas is great! A little hard to understand during lectures and his illegible writing doesn't help, but overall he is positive, funny and knows his subjects well. His lectures are note based so if you don't like writing copiously avoid his classes otherwise I would highly recommend him!",1
"Prior to entering this class i thought it was going to be pretty easy, LIES! the class was fun with the different workouts. The quizzes are challenging and he gives ton of extra credit! DO THEM!. The final has a average passing rate of 75% therefore Study!! mostly everyone failed and it brought my grade down from a B to a C :( thanks Final Exam.",1
"Worst class I've taken at JMU. Henigman is all over the place and difficult to follow. Canvas is extremly difficult to navigate. Lectures are boring, she doesnt make material intersting. Mandatory attendence but you cant gain points. Four shortpapers throughout the semester and 12 page final paper that she is very unclear about. Avoid if you can.",0
She does not care if you go to her office hours and show that you are really trying in the class. I had what I thought was a good relationship with her and she still gave me a C. She screams in class a and you cant understand her that well at times. I would never take her again. DO NOT TAKE HER!!!,0
24 CHAPTERS IN 3 MONTHS!!! ENDLESS READING AND GRADING MAKES 0 SENSE! CRAPPIEST TEACHER! She has an attitude for no reason. She does absolutely nothing for the class and you WILL have to teach yourself everything.,0
"difficult to understand, unclear instructions, never graded projects through out the semester, so had no idea what final grade would be.  Spent too much time doing attendance each week. lectures too long and not enough work time during the class. Jokes were not funny",0
I loved this class. She was very nice and helpful . I learned a lot of ways to better my studying skills from her. Easy A too!,1
"Prof. Keeling is a good teacher, and I found his course material really interesting and engaging. I would have liked the course better if he were more respectful. He tends to be very passive aggressive to his students and even complained about several of them to me in office hours once. Recommended as a professor, but not as a human being",0
"I dont use this ever, but here I am to warn you to not take David Stone. His average on his exam was a 47% (the first was a 58%), and the final was a 51%. He refused to say what the final exam average was until I asked the TA. He literally sent out a PDF explaining he's not fair bc life isn't fair and hence he wouldn't curve and to just suck it up",0
"Took his hybrid class tests are difficult and attendance is not required since they are online. However, tests are important and are based on the overall grade of class. A research paper 6 pages and online discussions is also the assignments in class. ",0
"AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE. Makes you buy his textbook that he wrote, cash only, and it's FULL of errors . Always late to class, disorganized, and wastes most lectures. He can't solve many of his own examples during class--totally incompetent! Doesn't know what he's doing and utterly atrocious at teaching. Gets angry/yells in class if you ask questions.",0
"He is old school. He is very personable, but not the best instructor. His test are ridiculously hard, but he grades on such a steep curve that I received a 100% on a test that I missed over 25 questions. I learned enough about the economy to say it wasn't a waste to attend his classes. I would recommend him.",0
"At first I didn't think that this class would be hard, I was wrong. 81 percent failed his class. He has a quiz every Friday. All short answers, you must be specific or they get marked wrong and spelling HAS to be correct. The test are ALL short answers too. You if plan on taking him make sure you study, and know all the material weeks before.",0
"Overall, I have enjoyed this class. Lee is very knowledgeable on the content area, and he seems genuinely interested in student learning. I feel I learned a lot from this course.",1
"Very easy to take --- tests are not difficult, and the research papers are a piece of cake.",1
"Worst professor at QC. NOT accessible outside of class, she doesn't answer emails. Disorganized, opens the submission link weeks after assignments are due. Boring, we read straight out of the textbooks during class discussions even though reading the textbook was our homework. She will call on you and make you feel dumb if you don't know the answer",0
"Mrs. Tersteegen is a good teacher. Buying the thin textbook is a joke and a waste of money. Thicker textbook we used often, other one twice. You don't have assignments sucks to be you points off. Definitely learn some things.",1
"I took math 115 in the summer with him and let me tell you, he should NOT be teaching.  He may be a good tutor but he is NOT A GOOD TEACHER.  He does expect you to just know the stuff and he doesn't teach anything.  I ended up having to drop the class and waste the $400 I paid for it... Not a happy camper!",0
"Her class is not suitable for beginners. The instructions for assessments are not clear. The focus points on each class hard to follow. Unreasonable time management for each project. Hard to communicate. Useless feedback. When you ask her a question, her feedback is not what you asking, her feedback is what she wants to say, and this is not",0
"This is a case of a guy that thinks he is good and that he knows stuff. Yet, once you finish your degree you realize that he was one of these profs that have done very little in their academic life and they just put up a big act. Pathetic!",0
"Not enough can be said for this beacon of light in the Lambton College faculty line up.  Delivers material very efficiently with clarity.  Intangibly, he provides motivating insights into various gainful career avenues in the accounting industry.  My best advice:  use this man to the fullest.  Don't let that sheepish grin fool you.",1
"Not a good prof.  Materials she teaches in class have nothing to do with Management Info Systems.  You will learn nothing in her class.  She will give you directions on how she wants assignments done, then she will still punish you anyway regardless.  Very unnecessarily cruel and evil prof.  Shame.",0
"I would have rated her a 0. She is a harsh grader for no reason. BEWARE of exams with locked browser, webcam and no way to go back and forth. She is not helpful and will eventually ignore emails and won't reply. no matter how well you do on anything else, if you fail the exams: you will fail. Unclear grader as well.",0
"Prof Grof is def in the top 10 profs I've ever taken.  Her tests are difficult but she gives you a test review right before the test and she tells you SPECIFICALLY what to study, unlike so many profs who say, ""Study the first 5 chapters.""  The Uni is trying to conform her, but right now she's one of the best.",1
"If English and reading isn't your strong suit, David's class is the one to take. You will get a lot out of it while not doing a ton of reading.",1
"Awesome teacher, always prepared and always something new.  She really goes all out for every class, with examples of great artists and is always nice to have an instructor who is also still working on her own art work.  She is so current!",1
"Garrigans class was heavily a lecture class. There are only 3 exams (that are each worth 25% of your grade) and 3 writing assignment (each 5%). So basically if you dont do well on one of the exams youre screwed. I find his grading system to be unfair, considering not all students test well. Bottom line, I wouldnt recommend taking his class.",0
"pretty easy, tests straight from book, participate in forums and will do fine. more involved in this class than evsp411. the 2 assignments are pretty easy if you just follow directions and use references provided. I think this is easy A",1
"Had her in my first year of university and I loved her, exams were easy and lectures were great.",1
"Professor Brown is a very genuine teacher.  He provides power points which makes note taking significantly easier.  His tests are a combination of multiple choice, definitions and short answer and he's very lenient with partial credit for the definitions and short answer.  The textbook for this course was a bit hefty (some chapters were 50+ pages)",1
Nicest guy! He made class fun and not scary to make speeches. Not a hard grader and says funny jokes! Makes class enjoyable and you want to be there. Highly recommend him!,1
"got a good grade, but bad teacher. kind of an air head. kinda nice. I worked pretty hard for my A, but you could prolly get a decent grade w/out much effort, but lectures can be annoying.",0
Was disappointed by the class.,0
"You are expected to already know linear algebra, dirac notation and any other math required for quantum mechanics. He will half (at most) work through problems or concepts and then not understand why you aren't ""getting it"". He can be a nice guy and will take some extra time during office hours. He can be short and condescending.",0
"Mrs. Moss knows her material, and can answer your questions to the best of her ability, but be careful if you ask a question on something she doesn't agree with. Dissections you basically have to do on your own and hope you do it right. We were given a crayfish, a knife and ZERO instruction. Interesting material, but poorly designed tests. Hard B. ",0
"What I have noticed throughout my experiences at CRC when I was enrolled inside this course during pastimes had to do with amount of overall spent time-consumption efforts, economic expenditures (tuition board fees and school supplies), STRICT ATTENDANCE POLICIES (PARTICIPATION POINTS), INTENSIVE READING CHAPTERS (TEXTBOOK), POWERPOINT SLIDES, ETC.",0
Mager is one of the best teachers I've had at KCC. He takes time to go over the lectures and he uses good examples for almost everything that are very easy to understand. He's funny too and you can tell that he has a passion for the subject. Tests are tough-so it's a good idea to be at every class. He's extremely helpful during lab. ,1
"He didnt let me take a retest becuase i missed the class for a funeral, we said I didnt have enough proof even though I had the proof. I couldnt understand a single thing he said. DO NOT TAKE HIM! I get all A's and still failed the class.",0
"Very sweet, understanding...not too tough.",1
"He made me enjoy algebra. For the first time i was making a's in algebra.DO not be late, and be respectful, and he will respect you. Do the work. Be very well prepared. Other wise watch it cus he will SNAP.",1
"Dr. Schulhoff makes the class interesting and fun even though we were talking about a tough topic - race and ethnicity. There is one book review paper, weekly quizzes, and a final exam so not too much work. The lectures, readings, discussions, and films were really engaging. The material stays with you. Great class and inspirational professor!",1
The class was so hard. He graded the paper so hard i withdrew his class right after midterms. i don't recommend him,0
"Mary is the best teacher! math also isnt my strongest subject, but she made it so easy and enjoyable. i would definitely take another class with her again!",1
"I believe she is a good teacher, she mostly reads out of the books but expects you to do your own work and be ready for test on all books. BUT over all was an easy class as long as you do your work. EASY TEST!",1
"Only gave him a ""1"" rating because they don't let you rate ""0"".",0
"I took Farris for Chem 151 and then again, unfortunately, for Chem 152. He was the only one available to fit into my schedule and I really wish I had another option for a General chemistry teacher. He is a nice enough guy, but his lectures drag on, and he does not prepare students properly for his tests. I do the work and still end up disappointed.",0
DO YOURSELF A FAVOR; TURN BACK NOW BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE!!!  STAY AWAY!!  DO NOT ENTER!!!  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!,0
"sweet lady, some boring music, but overall fun class.",1
Dr. V was a very brilliant yet challenging professor. Her tests and quizzes were difficult but fair for the most part in Genetics. If you study to understand the material and not just merely memorize the material then you will do well. She is very knowledgable but she has a tendency to be overwhelming with her level of detail at times.,1
"Prof Buck is not difficult to deal with he is fair with grading. I took his class online in the summer while taking other classes and his class stood out to have the most work. Several chapters and tests every week and essays and group discussions and 2, 5 page papers. This class had so much reading involved. He gives EXT CRED. Do the work get an A",1
"Might as well take calculus online because that's what you will be doing. The course is set up in a way that you watch videos every night and you have to TEACH YOURSELF calculus! He says that you can ask questions the next day but only answers maybe 2 at most because he is very unclear and disorganized. Avoid avoid avoid, trust me.",0
"If you naturally struggle with math, Professor Guetter is not the best at explaining things. He explains things way too fast and in little detail. If you don't have a strong foundation of mathematic understanding, his classes might be hard to understand.",0
"I took the class in person using the ALEKS program. Attendance was a large portion of your grade despite ALEKS being all online. She was also almost always late, and did not teach just answered questions. Nice enough lady, a little awkward but didnt teach much.",0
Tests are unnecessarily tricky. The way she asks questions makes you second guess yourself. They are so tricky that even she messed up 3 of the questions. The NCLEX questions aren't even that tricky. I am an A student and got a C on the first test. She told the class we were doing very well with an overall C average. How is that a good thing?,0
"Listen to me. Listen to these reviews. DO NOT, unless you have no other choice, take this instructor. Just save yourself a semester of pain.",0
"Great teacher! Has a sense of humor and brings food in for his students sometimes. Passing this class without studying every week for the quiz is difficult, so just study before the quiz. All of his lectures are posted on D2L so if you miss class you will still know what is going on.",1
WOW! Fred is an amazing teacher. He shows you new ways to use your mind to become better readers and thinkers. He used Humor to keep the class fun. And Man is he funny! Loves Cigars and Soda. He just really chanllanges you and wants you to become succesful in college and in life. What a GREAT teacher!,1
I hated this class. I didn't like the professor. I love History and Paulette genuinely made me dislike it. I did my homework but for some reason she failed me. She didn't grade a paper and she said she wouldn't give me anymore chances. Her lectures were boring and not at all helpful for the tests. Avoid her!,0
She was very straight to the point caring and insightful I was worried it being an 8 week course I wouldn't do well being I heard this class requires a lot of writing but nope only 2 papers the whole semester she was great I earn a A,1
"Maureen occasionally just won't show up to class, because  she over slept or wasn't feeling well. She is also often late. She took over a month to mark our first essays , giving us only less than a week to write and second and third final essay. She failed over half the class on the first essay. Her weekly quizzes are almost impossible & take 2hrs",0
"I have taken all the classes required for my cis associate before I took this class. So, I took this class at the end with Professor, when I found cis 20 is also required. I feel that I should have taken his class earlier. I finally do have confidence in Computer Programming after taking his class this semester. He is best if you want to learn.",1
"Worst class ever, respect yourself and choose a different professor",0
"The man does not speak a lick of English, is extremely shy when speaking in front of a lecture hall, and just reads off of his slides. He him self is a horrible educator for his lack of teaching skills. Tests are cake though. One side formula sheet you make for tests, 2 sided for final and questions come from inclass quizzes, lecture notes, and HW.",0
"Redding is cool! He keeps sociology interesting. Any soc 101 class obviously isnt going to be that difficult. Pay attention to his clicker questions, they often show up on exams. Pay attention, show up, review his study guides and youll be fine. Easy A!",1
"Not committed instructor. Disappeared on vacation for final 3 weeks of class where there was little internet access. Not helpful for an online class! Marginal feedback, poor communication. Set a major assignment due at end of Spring break then disappeared without answering online questions. Emailed my advisor to get an answer. Avoid if possible.",0
Horrible teacher. Does not know how to teach. He teaches as his students know a lot.,0
"I spent a lot of time navigating broken technology. I emailed the professor about issues (the website being down, the links being broken, not having access to the library database). She did eventually respond to my emails but my grade still took a hit for things that weren't my fault. Very frustrating class at times. May be better in person.",1
"she cant even answer questions off her own study guides, that she creates without googling it, and you still can't guarantee the answer that she gives you will be correct one. 90% of all her lab test will be on powerpoint slides, and 90% of the pictures she uses on her test will be terrible quality, and you're never quite sure what your looking at.",0
Really easy teacher. The entire class is based off the essays. Would recommend taking ENC1101 & ENC1102 before this class since it is all about your papers and discussion boards. Very easy going guy. Grades his papers fairly.,1
"Terrible experience. Very unorganized and lacks the necessary communication skills to teach remotely. Whole grade is based on 2 tests taken in a totally different format than 3rd party software she uses to ""teach"". Unreasonable expectations, passive aggressive emails, no passion. She doesn't care and it shows-don't waste your time/money.",0
really good,1
"final exam was a joke. focused a lot of class time to things that weren't even on the exam. the group project was so time consuming. he is not a nice person, doesn't have time to help you, doesn't answer his emails for days. avoid taking any class with him.",0
"Hansen is the best professorinstructorteacheretc. I've absolutely ever had. I've taken three classes with him (ENGL 301 and ENGL 455 twice with varying material) and I've loved all of them and hope to take more before I graduate next semester. He's a genius, he's quick-witted, funny, and a really quality professor. Take him every chance you get.",1
"she doesn't care if you can keep up with her teaching or not. She is the most subjective teacher I have ever seen. Once you know you are not her type, better frop the class ASAP because no matter how hard you try, she will still give you a low grade.",0
"Your grade for the class relies heavily on 4 exams, no extra credit offered, and very few assignments to buffer a poor grade on an exam",0
"David is an amazing professor. He is really funny, he made me laugh everyday, even when he wasn't funny, he still made me laugh. He's big on group work, so get to know your neighbors. He wants you to succeed and is willing to go above and beyond for his students, great teacher but more importantly a good human being.",1
"She's so great!  always helpful, always clear, always ready to explain something.  Fair, too.  I mean, the material's not easy, but when you actually study it, her exams are fair.",1
"This class may have been enjoyable if the professor was organized. AVOID TAKING MUSIC WITH THIS TEACHER AT ALL COSTS. Her marking was unfair, her class was a waste of time. She never followed the syllabus, and would just take items off the syllabus, and add ones at random. TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE.",0
"Notes/lectures on the website. HW and projects get progressively harder. HW eventually strays away from the notes, so it gets frustrating to find answers. Can be rude on random days. Exams are multiple choice. Just study off the past exams he gives. Curve is dependent on how smart the top 1/3 are as 1/3 gets A. No guidance on Proj after part 1.",0
"Physics 131, 132, 133, EGR 235 since i can't type it all! Awesome teacher, some of the best conversations i've had in college were with him. a blast to hand around. BIG HELPER!!!",1
"Have problems? Talk to him. Basically spelled out how he wanted his essays to look like, and even when I didnt have a whole lot of time to give to an essay I did what he said and got a B. ",1
Dr. Sikora is a great guy and a pretty good professor. During office hours he walks you through problems and answers all questions that you may have. He is always willing to help out as long as you show interest and are not just trying to get the answers from him. He is a very fair teacher and makes you want to learn more about mathematics.! ,1
"Professor Callaway is amazing. She runs a discussion-based class and encourages students to participate. I love her teaching style so muchI really feel like I connected to the texts. She gives amazing feedback on papers and makes her expectations clear for exams. If you have the chance, definitely take a class with Professor Callaway!",1
"This class is super easy to pass. All you have to do it go to class and have a basic understanding of physics. However, he has a super soft voice and can make you go to sleep. There is a presentation at the end , but gives you full credit if you try enough. Super easy class.",0
"Extremely boring, tests are hard. Avoid at all costs and take a different professor",0
one word. horrible,0
"Dale is an incredible professor. He understands people have a life outside of class, classwork is very manageable, he is fair, energetic and makes class fun. He knows his stuff and has a strong experience in his subjects. Best upper division teacher in UVU ASL!",1
Very cool teacher. I highly recommend. He's a CPA during the day and is part time teacher at night. Pretty easy class. I just wish that he was teaching BA 211. I didn't study for the first 2 tests and still got A's on them. He gave lots of real world examples and that made it more interesting. Lets you use note cards on test. I would take again!,1
Very passionate about his area of study.,1
"If you want to fall asleep in class you should really take him for english. He talks waaay too much, but nothing he says makes sense. He leaves too much work and theres alot of reading, talks more about history than anything else. Does not know how to teach I dropped his class and if you are smart you will too!",0
This class was so fun and I looked forward to going to this class. Enough said.,1
"Okay she is hard (like Exams, labs, her grading) For any small mistake she will take points off She curves and gives extra points for sec (little bit helpful) Make sure you pay attention to what she does in class and writes on the board similar prob on exams) oh she flys throughout slides yet u need to know everything for exam cracks same jk #x GL",0
Stay away from him. He cannot teach. I have had much better teaching from my High School teacher. His bedside manners are horrible. He will judge you and it is automatically assumed that the student is bad. Not true. Their entire department needs to be overhauled. I wish I had never come to SMU. They keep him so he can make you keep retaking $$$,0
"Professor Grant was a great professor. His lessons and discussions were very clear. He responded very quickly to emails. My only complaint would be that he took a long time to grade stuff. Going in I had no care for literature and I wasn't really thrilled with taking the class. But, Grant made it enjoyable and I actually feel like I learned stuff.",1
Class is way too long but content is easy and gives easy tests.,1
This professor has horrible communication skills. No integrity or willingness to own up when he may have conveyed a wrong message. Extremely unprofessional in his written and verbal correspondence as stated by other students if you don't agree with him. He will attack your integrity as a student if you say you misunderstood anything he said.,0
"She teaches not by getting her students to memorize, but making them know about the logical behind every math problems. Here comes the technical part of online instructions, and her incompetence shows. I got grades I do not deserve twice! Dont be late even if its her fault. If your quiz submitted on its own before due, its your fault and problem",0
I'm not a major and had to take this class. It turned out awesome though. She really loves what she does and actually kind of like it now too. Tests are based on lectures and are not easy but I guess ok as long as you go to class.  ,1
"Josh is amazing: very clear & very helpful. The subject can be a little dry sometimes, but his passion for it makes it interesting! Weekly readings & responses, 2 papers, 2 exams: worth taking & would take him again!",1
"Honestly, easy A if you remember to do all the assignments on BB... which is (not an exaggeration) over 500. At least 5 homework assignments A DAY. Miss something, flat out zero. Is not lenient whatsoever, not even during these tough times. Not empathetic at all. Email her? Expect a response a week later, or no response works well for her too.",0
"As long as you take notes and review you'll rock this class. He does give quizzes but there expected, the quizzes are the exact same as the test. Awesome class he's super funny, very clear and overall it was a good class. It does take some work but it's good!",1
Mrs. Nelson is a great teacher. She is an amazing singer as well and is so down to Earth. The content is very easy to understand if you study and read and pay attention. I would highly recommend this class.,1
"Easy online class. Straight forward work - read the book, do the quiz and assignments and you're gold.",1
"People learn in different ways and speeds, so Cote will be great for some students, but others not so much. She will not spoonfeed you nor will she dumb down the material for you. You are expected to keep up and understand her, despite how fast she may go. If you can grasp chem concepts fast & well, then shes good for you. Otherwise, AVOID.",0
Professor Hayden was AWESOME! Took her online during the pandemic and she was helpful. Always tried to help me when I had issues becuz of me job during COVID. She let us text her if we needed help. VEry understanding and patient. I learned a lot of stuff I didn't know. She's a caring teacher that I needed this semester.,1
Holly is extremely knowledgeable but not very approachable. I found her rubrics hard to follow and very nit picky.  IDK if graphic design is just like that but she should keep in mind that this is a required foundation class for all majors.,0
"I had Dr. Phelps for two art history classes. He was hard but fair. The people that complained about him never came to class or texted and slept.  So as long as you came, paid attention and took good notes you did well. In the first class the students where uninterested but in my second class the students where engaged and it made for a fun time.",1
"Worst class i have ever taken! tests were something else than the course material, tutorial was like being back in grade 6, the essay was out to trick students. Take her tenure away!",0
She is absolutely great! You can tell that she enjoys teaching and in turn makes us (students) want to learn. I totally agree with the others who have commented..I am also thankful!,1
"Monica is great, also helps that she teaches an easy class. Class attendance is a must as she doesn't post her slides. She keeps class interesting and the topics are relative. It also focuses a lot on women's rights & empowerment. Relatively easy class, no essays, final isn't cumulative. Would recommend",1
"i just dropped her class. she is completely useless. she doesn't actually TEACH. i have not learned a single thing other than she is a high class,condescending person. i have emailed her dept when she felt the need to degrade a student in front of the class. do not take her. do not waste your time.",0
Awful this man is a terrible teacher. He acts like his students in an intro class are CPAs and know what they are doing. I will be lucky if I make it out of his class alive. If you get this man change out of his classssssss please save yourself,0
Great Math teacher and always responding quickly! Will take one of his class again!,1
"Professor Birch is a fantastic teacher.  He will know you by name and care about helping you.  I wish all of the MET professors would adopt his style.  His classes are challenging, but very rewarding.  ",1
"some of the questions on the midterm are off the study guide. if you don't like history i wouldn't recommend it, boring class.",0
Great Calc 2 professor!,1
Tests are hard. There are no study guides- it is strictly tests. No assignments besides the tests. Final is optional.,1
"Had to attend lecture in order to be there for her pop quizzes. All notes were written on the board but she posted them on canvas so if you had to miss you could still get them. Tests were easy as they were verbatim from the quizzes and in class assignments. Also there is extra credit, even though you most likely don't need it. EASY A!!",1
Do not take this professor. She is extremely rude and inconsiderate. I went through horrible family problems and she was not willing to accommodate for me. This professor really made my mental health worse. All I learned from this course was that she needs to be more compassionate...,0
"Professor Morano was interesting. She was a bit wacky and definitely opinionated when telling her students how to write; however, she gave me a great deal of feedback that (hopefully!) helped me. The outside work was a little much and only somewhat furthered my overall understanding. Honestly don't know if I'd recommend her or not. ",1
"Dr. Curtis is hilarious and informative! Read textbook, tests are super hard if you don't! Tests are only multiple choice but you need to read book! The first test is the most difficult, seek help from a tutor to make it a lot easier!! She's the best but can be a tad scatterbrain. Write down every grade you receive & make sure final grade matches.",1
If by chance there is another analytical teacher definitely go with the other choice. TTS is cool but she is very unclear and unorganized with lecture material and lab material. I was completely lost the whole semester despite asking for help as much as possible. Online format may have posed an issue for her.,0
"The textbook and the lecture are word for word the same. Completely and utterly useless. The lectures are SOO long for no apparent reason, but the content itself is interesting. The way it takes forever to make notes, and her tests are based on fine details rather than the general topics. -11/10 would not recommend!",0
"If you like a text book structure type class then this isnt for you. The overall class is easy and the professor really cares just besure to ask questions. Very much hands on learning, homework is easy just make sure to take video notes because often times there is quizzes which she also uses to take attendance",1
"Friendly lady, not a great teacher. Don't get me wrong, if we were out of the classroom I would be her friend. She does not say what she means when it comes to the assignments. Make sure you are thorough on your on account. She will act like it's all good, but when it comes down to grading she will say something like...well want I wanted was this..",0
His Social Media class online was great. It requires you to come up with an idea that you can expand on different media platforms and you add on to it all semester. It was actually quite easy! He grades pretty easy and extremely helpful.,1
"Honestly, class with him was stressful. He loves calling people out in front of the entire class. EXTREMELY strict cell phone policy, always walking around the classroom during tests which makes a tense environment. 2 papers due the day of the midterm and final. The good thing is he does an in depth review of the test the day before. Pretty easy A-",1
Worst Professor at the Citadel. Boring as watching  paint dry. Uses every second of class for terrible lectures. Makes everyone uncomfortable by asking gotcha questions. All academic background with no real world experience. Avoid him at all cost. Little man syndrome run wild.,0
Professor Pilkington was great!  My computer messed up during an online quiz and he went out of his way to let me take it again.  Lectures were pretty straight-forward.  Willing to help as long as long as you are polite about it.,1
Dr. Miller is a nice guy but he does not try to help you at all. His labs are the absolute worst.,0
"Reads way too fast, expects you to keep up and understand what she is doing.",0
"Ho, is literally the one of my worst profs. I had him for Micro Economics, and all I have to say is get ready to work. Even though I never went to class because he does heavy lectures and goes to fast. I decided to self teach. One good thing about Ho, he uses the study guide and literally uses the study guide as the exam. So memorize it.",0
"Literally the best teacher I have had. Supported me through class and beyond. Is passionate about both learning and teaching how biology can cure some of the most difficult health problems. Her class is designed so that you can learn which ever way is easiest for you, tests are fair yet tough, and you have chances to recover from a poor grade.",1
tough,0
"He has life/work experience that applies very well to the class content! Encourages discussions and questions, which makes the class engaged altogether. The workload for this course is very reasonable so if you're a full-time student and/or working at a job, don't be strayed away! This class is THE BEST, the professor could not get any better.",1
"Easily my favorite professor at camden! Whoever wrote that you lose points for missing one class is obviously not listening, she allows 4 missed classes and is so caring when you are going through stuff. The new online attendance system was messed up and deducting points for absences and she explained in class that she was fixing it...",1
The class is really boring. And he doesn't really teach much besides reading from the book.,0
"Gina wants everybody to do well in her class and goes above and beyond to make that happen. There are no tests in this class which is awesome. She has a great relationship with all of her students. By far the best teacher I have had at Chico so far. Show up to class, try your best and you will get a good grade.",1
"I love Professor Theus so much, she is so sweet and is easy A you participate and pay attention. some people think that she may have an attitude but that's just her personality, it's very loud and very vivacious, I personally like it! she is also very understanding and has a free textbook pdf so you don't have to pay for your textbook.",1
"Professor Burnier does a great job at teaching, especially because he assigns papers that have to do with the history of Illinois and Chicago. He often goes on rants that pertain to nothing about the topics that we are supposed to be talking about, but overall he was great!",1
This professor is really tough. His grading criteria is unclear and he grades harshly. He expects you to take literally everything from his lectures and spit it back out at him. Do not take any of his classes unless you feel like making your GPA drop by several points,0
AVOID. AVOID. AVOID. I cannot say it enough times. This man thrives on seeing his students fail. His tests are downright impossible. He is an incredibly tough grader as well. I took the online course and he made us come in to take an exam because he thought we were all cheating. I promise even if you did cheat you'd probably still fail. AVOIDDDDDD!,0
"My feedback will be towards non music majors, I believe that his class is super cool and interesting. As long as you put effort into studying, you'll be fine. He's a kind professor so don't be afraid to ask questions. Tough in the beginning but you will transition through.",1
she is toplofty and does not help. she does not know how to lecture. I dropped out because of her. Do not take her,0
Her assignments are very time consuming and she is a very picky marker. Her lectures are boring and she thinks that talking loudly will help us learn.,0
He is super funny and talks about his family all the time. Make sure you read everything he tells you to read. You need the text book,1
"Calc 1 & 2 were not my favorite, but Dr. Justice managed to make calc 3 much easier for me. I can't speak for in-person, but online Fall 2020 has been great. It's still difficult content, but his lectures are easy to follow and his exams are very similar to his lectures. Honestly, quizzes were harder than exams. We love Brad. Take him if you can!!",1
"You will have pop quizzes everyday in this class, which are extremely difficult to pass because this professor lectures on one slide the whole class. It is very hard to pay attention in this class because the professor is not good at lecturing and is very very boring. Very hard to pass this class, I do not recommend taking this.",0
"even if you come FIVE mins late, he won't accept your HW. if you're even ONE minute late, he won't accept your HW.  WARNING: DO NOT TAKE IT!!! (I never hate classes as much as this one)",0
"This teacher teaches Comp Lab, clinical, and adult health nursing. She is so much fun and loves to help her students learn. You can meet with her any time outside of class for help. Shes the type of teacher that doesn't mind you calling her cell phone and she will call yours if theres a problem. Great!!!",1
"Best professor at CSUN. I have taken her twice and she is always challenging, passionate, and thought-provoking. I can't recommend her enough. True, this is a hard class, but totally worth it. Give it your all and you will really get a lot out of the class. She made me see the world in a whole different way!",1
"THIS TEACHER IS RIDCULOUS. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS IT IS HORRIBLE. Mr. Weiner is a horrible professor and very self conceited that he makes you read HIS OWN BOOKS. The work is managable but only if you have a lot of spare time. He does not give constructive feedback, and his grading is very harsh and confsuing. He also cusses alot so be prepared.",0
"I had the pleasure of taking Coach Milburn's Health 101 Summer 2018 I really enjoyed the course I learned much more than I expected to learn, Coach offers plenty of extra credit so there is no reason not to get your easy ""A"". I highly recommend this course Coach Milburn is the best!",1
Dr. Lane can be extremely rude. He's not the worst but not the best. Assignments are easy but pointless. Take class with someone else if possibl.e,0
"Disorganized instructor. Her French sounds bizarre, with a strong English accent. Relies too much on the Internet. She shows up late to class way too many times. She does not seem to remember to return marked papers. I can't figured out what or if  we learned anything in this course. Never again with this instructor, not recommended!",0
"Poor communication regarding expectations and course information and updates are all over the place, if you can even find it online.",0
"Students like him because he's an easy grader. His ""holier than thou"" attitude is unbearable, his humor is very dry. Funny how he thinks he understands what he is teaching when he ran for local office twice and didn't win either time lol. Take the class if you want an easy A but if you want to learn something, don't bother.",0
She acts like everyone in the class is a CPA. Unfortunately she does not take into consideration that everyone is not an accounting wiz. She is very tuff and very unreasonable. She teaches only through PowerPoint and make other people feel like they are stupid. Her final is so difficult that you cant even finish! NEVER TAKE!!,0
Don't get on his bad side. Not very understanding. Everything must be done his way or no credit. Makes multiple uncalled for political jabs.,0
Jerk... I had him over 10 years ago... good to see he hasn't changed. at least he didn't totally kill my love for math (since I'm a math teacher now),0
"Very sweet guy, but I almost died of boredom. On the first day, he told us he repeats himself at least 3 times so that students won't forget the material and he wasn't kidding. Super easy A if you don't mind wading through busy work every week.",0
"BY FAR my worst learning experience at Humber College to date. This instructor was an absolute embarrassment to Humber's reputation, and should be removed from the faculty immediately. Only showed up on time for 2 out of 15 classes. When he did arrive he was arrogant and demeaning. He made me feel dumb for asking questions. Unprofessional bully.",0
"Had her for Business Communication.  Loved this woman.  So funny and clever.  I would most certainly call her up for resume writing because the lady knows how to ""schmooze"" her way into anything.",1
"You feel like you are in elementary school (color coded groups...etc.) bad first impression, yet she expects high quailty work! Lots of HW online. (time consuming)!!! I studied all the time and would do terrible on tests.  She did offer EC towards the end of sem though.  If you like to teach yourself take this class!!",0
"I wish I'd taken this class earlier, because it really explained a lot of things I didn't understand before. She really wants to make sure her students understand each topic before moving on.",1
Not a very good lecturer.,0
Dr. B is an amazing person and very devoted to his students. This class is so much fun. He makes sure that all the students know that he is there if they need any help. I learned a lot in such a short period of time. I recommend him if you want a helpful teacher.,1
"This professor is awful. Her lectures vs. her homeworks/worksheets vs. her textbooks are completely off. She teaches you like she expects you to know what is already going on, and she can't be bothered with questions. The only good thing about this class is that it's a ""free class"" meaning you don't have to buy a textbook.",0
"Took him for lab and he was a good professor. His notes are easy to follow and he draws lots of pictures to make things easier. He's always willing to help you but he doesn't always respond to E-mail, so go and see him during office hours. The final powerpoint project was easy and interesting. Defintely take him for lab!",1
Was the class difficult? No. Was there work involved? Yes. Was it an easy 'A?' No.,1
At first she was ok but as time went on she became less nice. A few times I went to her for help about things  and she acted as if I was dumb.She was extremely over the top about the final exam to a point where it made you nervous. Students had legitimate questions on the test because the ink ran out on some of the questions and she refused to help,0
"This class we really confusing to me. The lectures didn't help me fully grasp the material. There was nothing really special about the Kristen's teaching. The homework can be really misleading, as the problem format do not match the test problems. Your best chance of passing this class is reading through each chapter, and mastering the TI calculate",0
"Very hard to keep up with, knows what he's doing, but not very good at explaining himself. This is the first class I have ever failed. He is also not good at posting grades on blackboard, so you aren't able to see what you have overall in the class. Would not recommend.",0
He is ADORABLE. And smart. And nice. And funny. And wise. Did I mention ADORABLE?,1
"I dropped his course when he told a story about kicking a student out of his class when the student didn't understand the course work. H also spent half of every class talking trash about the students who don't read the book. This was meant to be a warning to get students to read the book, but I was paying to be taught, not to listen to his rants.",0
Horrible teacher. she made me want to drop out of college entirely. She lowered my self esteem and I felt very uneasy around her. TAKE KATHY SOHN!!!,0
"A kind, knowledgeable, phenomenal teacher.  I would recommend any of his classes. He is hilarious, engaging, and intelligent.  This class was so far from my major, and yet I enjoyed class everyday.  Study, its astronomy.  But Looney is fantastic.",1
"I took this class online and I have never regretted anything more. The material we were told to study was nowhere near what was on the tests/quizzes. Instead of understanding and being accommodating, she was accusatory, rude, and dismissive! Every week, something went wrong. If this class had been taught by anyone else, it would have been great.",0
"My biggest regret has been taking this class. He is the toughest grader ever. I got my first B plus on a paper ever in this class and he only wrote one note on the paper. Do not take him ever, you will regret it.",0
"Dr. Kunz is by far the best professor, psych or otherwise, I've ever had. The class is super interesting and he is hilarious; which helps. The tests are pretty straightforward as long as you go to class and take good notes. Excellent dude, fun class; a must take! Plus he's hot.",1
"Not much things from lectures got correct on exam. I literally recorded his lecture. If you fall behind people in areas where others did well, you will regret it. Don't waste time to do better than others. Don't confuse him on projects by sorting things differently from others. He wouldn't ask questions and makes bad judgement. No one copies exams",0
"He is a great guy but he doesn't give very good instructions. He is very experienced, but I think age is beginning to affect his memory and processing.",0
"Very poor lecturer. Makes many mistakes and tries to do problems ""his way"" which ends up confusing students even more since his explanations are never adequate. Too bad there is only ever 1 section for the classes he teaches so theres no way in getting around him. Learn from the textbook or youtube and do ample example problems for each section.",0
She was extremely rude and was constantly calling out students. She was also very unclear with assignments and got pissy when people messed up. She would walk around the class and stand over people's shoulders all the time as well. I did well in this class but she made me uncomfortable.,0
"Lectures are terrible, and to make them worse, she quiz at the beginning or end of the lecture. Not organized and I felt genuinely did not care about teaching.",0
Don't take this class with this professor! No grade updates at all so you have no idea where you stand. Required reading doesn't count toward the grade at all.,0
"Boring and not stimulating at all. Having the class at 9 AM doesn't help, but I don't want to pay money to hear her drone the book for an hour. I was just hoping for more.",1
"He is an extremely tough grader (looking for specific wording in exams). He also talks about being available for help anytime outside of class, but when you ask him questions or try to reach out he is either dismissive/passive aggressive or never replies (email). I am currently teaching myself with the textbook. Take this class with someone else!",0
"This woman is the most positive person alive and it's contagious. Also, she'll help you rationalize any horrible thing you do in your life. She's so much fun and she made me actually look forward to Monday classes.",1
Exams are so unnecessarily hard. Avoid at all costs.,0
Best professor I've ever had at UT !!! Highly recommend him. Makes Calc 2 so easy!,1
Topic: Women in German Culture. Agatha was truly great. I didn't know what to expect from the course but she is very kind and helpful and really wants everyone to succeed. I would love to have her again.,1
Professor Walker is a great teacher. She is very understanding and likes to truly get to know her students. All of her lessons and assignments are applicable to real world situations and you truly learn something. She even throws in random useful gems for students like what credit is etc.,1
"Professor Conway does nothing but read off his powerpoints every lecture. There are few opportunities for grades in this class so make them count, especially considering he is a very hard grader. He will pick out the smallest detail in an assignment just so you don't get a 100. Don't take the class if you don't have to.",0
"I would not take her again for public speaking. She gets very political and judgmental if you do not have the same political beliefs as her. She should be teaching debate or political science. If you agree with her views you would love her but if not, it sucks. A lot of wasted time in class but heavy questioned tests so you have to pay attention!!",0
Easy A good professor group project at the end no cumulated final only grades exams and group project and gives points for attendance,1
She is very straightforward with what you need to know. Just study for the exams and attend all the lectures.,1
