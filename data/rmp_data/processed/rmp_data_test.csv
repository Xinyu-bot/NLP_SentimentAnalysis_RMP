"Professor is extremely helpful, will come to campus on off days. Keep in mind he lives about 3 hours away. Honestly, provides so much material which compensates for your possible difficulty of hearing him. He is a nice man and REAL. Take him as your professor you will not be disappointed, just do the work, come to class, & use the power-points.",1
One of the Best Teachers at RWU.,1
Really good class to take.  She makes it easy to follow along and very fair in grading.  The only problem is when she turns the lights off its a little harder to pay attention (night class),1
"Jim is really nice and cares so much. But he doesn't really teach. He reads from the book and has you do activities from it. He has a lot of knowledge about social work, but only shared personal experiences a few times. The grade was a couple tests, book assignments, and assessments of a classmate.",1
"Great teacher, Got everyone involved. Graded easy. Made a scary class fun. I definitely recommend her for speech!!!",1
"Loved his class, very well prepared.  The arrogance was just the touch needed to wake you up in the morning, very entertaining.  I would love to take one of his classes again.",1
"How to get an 'A': 1.) Write good papers. There are 3: 2 simple book reviews and a research paper. he grades easy. 2.) go to class and he will like you. He gives out extra credit 1/2 the time for showing up, and you can usually get 5-15 points EC for each exam. 3.) STUDY THE OLD EXAMS ON BB. Literally 90% of the questions are recycled. LITERALLY 90",1
"! He is very intelligent and knows all the material, issue is how he teaches. He will work out 3 problems from a section and move on. Then he will assign hw problems with numerous problems we never went over. HW will take you hours to complete. I asked to help many times and was told to read the book. Moves to quick and seems bothered my questions.",0
"Terrorism in the Modern World--this class was so useful, learned all about current events. It's a tough class but if you go to lecture, take good notes, and study really well then it is not hard to get a good grade and the class is very worthwhile.",1
She pretty cool. She gives you assignments that actually go along with the chapter you are working on. She gives you plenty of time to complete assignments. She goes over the book in detail so you don't really have to read until you study for the exam.,1
"Possibly the worst class ive ever had. From the beginning of the semester, the entire class had to spend countless hours at the math lab.  If you have trouble with math STEER CLEAR. Dont get me wrong, professor is a nice guy, his teaching is horrible.",0
"Good teacher, never took economics in high school and I still understand it. Can make the students laugh and generally make the class not extremly boring. A top notch teacher",1
"Stay away from this ""professor"" if you haven't had any education regarding Computer sci prior to enrolling this course. Secondly, get ready to put in the work, literally, you're going to depend more on the book, and other resources before the prof. To conclude, this instructor is unwilling or unable to adapt to provide proper teaching. Good luck.",0
I took him fall 09 and it was a great course. The readings were definitely interesting and he brought his passion and history to class. He's quite funny if you're smart enough to comprehend his jokes and his gotten a lot stricter than I expected but still a great course with him.,1
"Great teacher! Is very flexible and helps you if you need it. You have to study, her tests are hard.",1
"Very nice professor, love her personality! LABS ARE FUN, BUT If your are not a science major DO NOT take this class. Test are tough  ""This is why i hate teaching non science majors"" Her words exactly.",0
"She is a hard Prof, sometimes a little unclear. She is always willing to help and clarify.  She has a very good sense of humor that helps when studying something that may not be exciting like stats. Not afraid to bring up the hard subjects and encourages thoughts and opinions.",1
"She inherited this class this sem. it was a rough start. But ended well. She is wonderful in her office, very patient with all ??. She is a fair grader. Essays need to be clean, she is very picky about grammar. Book is hard to understand but after a while I got the hang of it. It was a hard class if you don't study.",1
"I have taken about 6 classes with Professor Graham. While the material assigned is somewhat time consuming, the lectures are straightforward and Professor Graham is very good at responding to emails and providing help. I feel like he cares about his students and I'm sad that this is my last math class as I'd gladly take him again.",1
"I cannot recommend her enough! She's a wonderful woman and teacher. <3 Her course is easy but not too easy, and you can tell she loves her job! She's amazing. Take her if you can, I can almost guarantee you won't regret it.",1
"Dr. K was a really great professor & I liked her a lot for explaining things so you actually understood it & how the building blocks of chemistry works. The only thing I didnt like is that no matter how hard you try, she wont scale or curve. Her practice problems & exams were kinda different/harder from what you see in lecture too",1
Very intense. Amazing gaining. High risk of A minus.,1
Professor Egan is definitely a great professor. The class is interesting and very simple. He definitely wants you to earn an A.,1
"She offers you extra to retry for quizzes but she not helpful if you don't understand, your midterm and final is what will make the difference in whether you pass or fail her class.  If you don't pass either midterm or final, you're more like to not pass the class.",0
"Her labs are awful. Her classes are okayish but could be better. You read powerpoints, you get the questions from book. You read both book and powerpoints, you have no idea where the questions came from. Tests are hard, not because students don't read it, but because the questions are vague. She does give bonus points , which is the only good thing",0
This professor was not helpful at all. Students would have questions but she would never fully answer them. She would not give me the grade I deserved after writing good feedback on my papers. Class time was a complete waste of time. I did not learn anything. I would not recommend for anyone.,0
"Horrible. Dont like her teaching style, couldn't understand a word she said. Read off the slides and that was it. If I saw she was teaching another course I wouldn't pick it",0
Good professor who takes his time to make sure students understand the material. You can also tell that he genuinely wants people to do well. Class's were fun while also very informative. Would definitely take again.,1
"He is a great teacher! My first semester of college has been full of awful teachers and boring classes, but he has made me love college. He does have an accent but he explains things thoroughly and makes things easy to understand.",1
Marek is the worst thing that has happened to the education system since the attack on Columbine. His grasp of English is so poor you spend more time deciphering his mumblings than you do taking notes. He seems very ill-informed on the subject matter and generally spends more time confusing himself than teaching us anything.,0
Green is arguably the best professor in the English Department. He makes you feel confident that you have the capability to succeed. He is available almost every day outside of class for office hours and gives great feedback because he does expect great work from his students every time. Very understanding and personable as well.,1
"Usually interesting lectures, and the material is fascinating (at least to me), so it'd be hard to screw it up.  His powerpoints are kind of bland (black text, white background), but he is a good enough speaker to make up for it.  Readings in 130 were almost identical to lecture content. 237 was probably my favorite class ever. Write well, get As.",1
Knowledgeable and an excellent teacher/explainer - A LOT of work but work youll learn from.,1
What an awesome dude. Truly cares about his students and has such knowledge and wisdom on life. He is very open and kind. A good course to take and get something out of it!,1
"Decent teacher, somewhat lame sense of humor, boring subject",1
"Goes fast through new material/review, but stops and explains if a question is asked. Quiz almost every class period, tests cumulative. Available outside of class for help, but not directly advertised.",1
Lots of homework but she is great overall. The history labs are annoying because they are group projects and often all members of the group don't finish their parts and you have to pick up the slack. Lots of small projects and assignments but overall an easy A or B if you put in the work.,1
"This professor is way too difficult. She is extremely confusing and drops a load of work on you from the start. The class just started for me and I instantly regret this taking her. I don't know how I'm going to pass this. If you're looking for a chill and normal PSYC class, this is not it. This is for the people that like to work very very hard.",0
The professor doesn't have a lot of material to work on.  I had to go use the textbook so I could have some practice on the subjects taught in class. She emphasis on the use of powerpoints.,1
"He cares deeply about literature and is always available for his students. His teaching style is amazing because everyone talks in class. It was very enjoyable to go to class and the readings were not heavy at all. This class is definitely worth it, but you can't slack off and get a good grade.",1
Stunning and Electrifying,1
"Dr. Chang is a great professor, with good teaching skills and a passion for the material. He made probability theory very graspable for me. The only problem is that he often shoots down students' questions if they require ""too much ink"" to go over in class. Keep your questions short, or he will blow you off.",1
"Wisotzki is by far the best art history professor in Loyola She is amazing and she is hilarious. She offers guided tours of the Art Institute for review and they are a great tool to study for her tests. The class is hard and there is a lot of memorizing. 2 tests, a final and a research paper. Go to class and take good notes and you should be fine.",1
"I loved this class and instructor! Ms. Langille loves her topic and is very encouraging.  This is a difficult class and takes lots of studying.  At the end of the semester it is amazing how much I learned. Ms. Langille encourages class discussions about any interesting topic in A and P. Class was fun, hard but fun- I am very proud of my grade!",1
"Her class is very straightforward.  She reads you her notes, you copy them down, then take a test.  Not too hard, not too easy.  It is nice to get a Christian perspective of history, I would recomend her.",1
"His lectures were stunning and electrifying, and he kept the class interesting. His test were straight from the lectures and as long as you listen in class you will have no problem passing.",1
"LOVED this class! She has a respect for students that is unsurpassed by any other prof. Expects a lot from her students. Genuinely interested in students' thoughts and opinions- gets upset if no one wants to comment. Incredibly knowledgeable, and will expose you to diverse, unusual, and interesting ideas. I wish I could take this class again!!",1
"This class is not easy A class anymore, because recently she changed her lecture. Such as finish minimum 2800 words 12 pages report paper in a week and 20 pages reporting paper for final. unless you love to write reporting paper, I am not recommended this class.",0
"Professor Prentiss was AMAZING!! Yes, we did have to write a few papers, but they were easy and she gave amazing feedback. She is very caring and wants you to do well and will work to help you catch up if you miss a class. I would very much recommend her as a professor because she is the best one I have had!",1
"One of the best at LSU no doubt. I look forward to going to class. Clear grading, great lectures, and really cares about the subject. Would take again if I could. Going to class is important.",1
Best professor I have had.  I have been in several of her classes and have learned so much in a short amount of time. Very interesting and her passion for teaching is apparent. I would love to take an Art History Class from her at Saddleback.,1
This class by all means is horrible. Quizzes are very strict down to the point of accuracy. She gives out a lot of reading so be prepared to be overwhelm in reading. Her class lecture is very heavy on details and all she does it talk and talk. Not very engaging nor does she impact the class. She's very bad at teaching to be organize while she's not,0
"No recorded or live lectures, basically teaching yourself the material. Have to watch a show (paid by student) and 1 season per week plus reading and then homework on the show and readings. Little to no engagement with students and assignments seem non-educational and unnecessary. Grading is late & professor is unorganized.",0
He is a really nice guy. Expect to write 2 papers a week and don't expect more than an 18/20 often. His mid term and final are not bad. The material can get really boring. My writing really improved over the semester.,1
"David is a good professor but didnt like the class. The other professor is much easier. David is better for life stuff, very helpful when it comes to needing help outside of class, like looking over resume and looking for internships. Had very good life lesson stories to say but the class overall was too hard i thought. Yes need the book, on tests",1
The nicest prof youll ever have at McGill. He doesnt try to trick you and exams are very easy. Dont need much studying to ace the class.,1
"Professor Wolverton's History 436: Top Charlemagne course was profoundly engaging, deep on content and heavy with lectures and participation. She's a tough one with grading and comments, but she is incredibly intelligent and well-versed in her field. Her course isn't for those seeking to skip by; attendance is a must, participate at any chance.",1
"Very lecture heavy class. Although he wont do anything if you skip class, I would not recommend doing so because he does not give PowerPoints with detailed notes. Great guy and very enthusiastic about history, just very note heavy.",1
No Comments,0
If you don't have your notebook you've basically failed the class.,0
Cornell is an awesome teacher!  No complaints what so ever!!,1
"This guy blew my mind. The class was extremely difficult for me, so I had to work really hard for a C+, but he loves economics and if you go to his office hours then you're definitely on his good side and get more XC opportunities. He tells the craziest stories in between lectures, how he speaks 7 languages, was in a refugee camp, etc. Very wild.",1
"His exams have nothing to do with whether you learned the material or not. He simply takes small details from photographs and picture captions and tests your memory, of 8 CHAPTERS AT A TIME!",0
"Even through reading the transcripts, I could tell that Dr. Kelley has a deep love and understanding for psychology. She made challenging and uncomfortable topics seem completely normal and understandable. The small details that she includes brought the online class to life.",1
"I loved Professor Lamprey. She is such a sweetheart. All the work for this course is online, everything is straight forward and clear and she is always there if you need help. She also adds points to each exam. It is basically impossible to fail if you do the work and do it well. This was one of the easiest classes I have ever taken. ",1
This professor is very clear of what he expects from the students. He is a very tough grader. I worked very hard on a paper and he gave me a D. I also studied for hours on the material and still had a hard time with the tests. I enjoyed writing in our daily journals until he told me I was living in a utopia world. ,1
She's a cool and understanding teacher! She assigns a light load of hw and makes learning easy. I always feel that I understand the material in her class.,1
one of the best teacher I have ever met,1
"She grades harshly and takes off points for minor things. She will find any specific thing to mark you off some points. Impossible to get an A on anything. Psych 1 was supposed to be an intro to the subject and class, but no I was welcomed with mistreatment. If you are a Psych Major then sure have at it. But for those who aren't then good luck to u",0
"Professor Richmond is so sweet and a very genuine person who only wants the best for her students. Attendance wasn't mandatory and every quiz/exam was on Blackboard. Don't purchase the textbook, its not worth paying for as her power points sum up each chapter very well.",1
"This class was kind of difficult in some parts. Dr. Sheridan is an amazing professor though, he's very passionate and insightful through his lectures. He gives 2 major tests (midterm and final) and 3 quizzes based on the 3 thematic books that he assigns.",1
"Dr. Marlow's class is engaging and challenging. He loves to draw from his students' experiences and welcomes feedback and opinions. The textbook is your best friend, but he chose one valuable enough that I still reference it in future classes. Truly one of the best professors I've had",1
"She is the best chemistry professor. She replaces your lowest exam scores with your final. Her lectures are really good. She gives you lots of opportunity for practice. Take her, and do some practice problems you can pass her class with 100%",1
"Well, this is the hardest course I ever took. The materials are not easy to absorb and Prof. Ho is tough grader as well (6069D,7079C, no curve ). As long as you show him you understand the material, he will forgive you. He want the students to ask questions and he is willing to help. 2.42,Maxwell,wave(chapter 7) will be 40% of the total grade.",1
"He takes a minute to post grades but is easily accessible thru email if you have any questions. One quiz per week except when you have your linear project. Participation is one homework assignment per week, literally one problem. Textbook was online. You can do extra homework problems for extra credit.",1
"She's crazy, but awesome...",1
"Very smart and interesting professor! Class can be a bit boring, and it is hard to know what she is looking for on papers if you aren't too familiar with art history papers. Attendance isn't mandatory, but you will get thrown off if you miss. Ok class, but i wouldn't reccommend it if you are a non-major.",1
very easy and helpful. she gives extra credit papers. Easy A. language is a lil hard but if you are good with memory take her.,1
"Dr. Hollis is absolutely hilarious, fun to talk to, and has the best stories. However, he makes an already-difficult class (animal physiology) infinitely more difficult. His test questions are very specific to tiny details, not the whole picture. He is unsympathetic to any difficulties and unhelpful outside of class. Dense lectures, and READING.",1
"He will give pop quizzes if no one shows up to class, so attend every class. Make sure to do well on the first few tests because they do get more difficult towards the end! The homework for this course takes a lot of time to complete but turn in all assignments and you will be fine. Hes really nice and easy to talk to if you ever have questions.",1
She is a nice lady. Very caring when it comes to her students and is always willing to help you better your education as well as finding ways to help you find ways to help with tuition like grants and stuff. She is very serious about her class and if you listen to her its an easy A. :-),1
"this guy speaks in a sign language.although helpfull personally but tests are so hard, going to class meaningless, i would rather jab a fork in my mouth than take any class from him.",0
"Dr. Kroll makes you work in this class. On the flip side, you will learn a lot from it. Numerous homework assignments every week, weekly discussion boards, weekly quizzes, a mid-term, and final. Be prepared to be inundated with work. This is one of those classes that if you don't devote all of your attention, you're going to sink very fast.",1
"Not super note-heavy, so you can focus more on what he's saying rather than trying to copy the notes. There's quizzes after every chapter as well as homework for every chapter that is due when you take the tests. Overall, he's a really nice and understanding professor who makes his lectures interesting and clearly cares about all of his students.",1
"Professor Schap will hold you well over the time period every single, showing a blatant lack of respect for students as individuals outside of his class. He also decided to send us links to YouTube videos halfway through the semester and watched those instead of class. I payed a lot of money to watch random YouTube videos. Frustrating.",0
"Jon is a great professor. I've taken several classes from him. He does expect a lot from his students (which is fair because he teaches upper division classes). He is great at responding to emails and giving good feedback. Although his class is hard, it is SO worth taking. Just be sure to get a good group. This will make your live so much easier!",1
"LMG is the best. She sends a kind reminder after each class to let you know what went on during class if you missed. Homeworks are easy points. Hardest thing in the class is the test, but study some and you should be alright. I would definitely recommend taking her class.",1
honestly he is super nice and he tries really hard to keep everyone engaged. He provided a 15 minute break for the class and most of the time ended with a video he wanted us to see. The tests were pretty fair but your screwed if you don't come to class. He asks random questions based on in lecture material.,1
"Way too much reading for a graduate class; lots of readings were redundant.  Piled on a major paper during spring break which is really bad because by then I needed a break from his class.  Avoid this guy if you want the usual graduate reading level that allows you to read, understand and MASTER the material; that's what Masters means.",0
"Great prof, will take again. Speak up in class, participation matters",1
"I would recommend this professor to those who can follow instructions and go above what is required.  If you can follow instructions, you will do well. He didn't ask too much either. This is coming from someone that had 5 online classes!  If you do an online course with him, expect discussion boards, writing assignments, and tests. Fairly simple!",1
"She's Awful Awful don't take her if you register her class for now drop her today is last day to drop classes ,",0
"Dudrick is easily my favorite professor so far. He's so chill and funny, and extremely smart but not intimidating. The material can be confusing but he does a great job of helping students understand. His tests are pretty straightforward as long as you do the reading, attend class and take notes. I REALLY recommend him for any philosophy course. ",1
"So this guy is great. He does have a thick accent but is homework is worth 30%, he listens to his students, and his tests have extra credit and are relatively straight-forward.  He told us he curves final grades so 80% of the class makes an A or B.",1
"Teacher that does not like students despite what he himself thinks. Overall, the class was uncomfortable with an almost hostile feeling to it. He also does not understand modern approaches to software projects. Class also does not have a lot of resources. You will be punished for using internet for help (not code copying). Also no piazza.",0
"online literature set up clearly.  Assignments due every two weeks.  No tests except exam.  Had to post journals, lengthy unit discussions, 1 short research project. Good readings.  Must meet deadlines, but very fair professor if you read and do the work. Summer online lit. is only 8 weeks long,not 15, so only serious students should attempt.",1
"Sam is AMAZING. He understands his students better than any professor I've ever had. He will answer all your questions and make sure you do well, as long as you put in a marginal amount of work. Even though the class isn't strictly structured, it's HARD not to do well one exams and homework. You don't have to do the reading, just show up to class.",1
"I decided to become an anthropology/sociology major because of her. Literally, one of my favorite professors. Changed my life. I can only dream of being like her one day.",1
"His class is very fun and interesting, you will leave his class with a new perspective on life.",1
"One of the most boring classes I have ever taken, I was really excited for this class just to catch myself falling asleep every single day. Attendance is super lenient but he makes it very hard to go to class. Zero group activities or any engaging in the classroom, I don't even know a single persons name in my class. Exam study guides are 10 pages.",0
"I came to this class with some understanding of statistics.  I'm leaving wondering what the heck he was talking about.  As has been said, he teaches from the slides, which usually don't make much sense.  His lectures simply aren't clear and he doesn't seem to care.",0
"If you're looking to actually learn about literature, don't take this class. Its structure consists of games that have nothing to do with the pieces you're learning about. Dr. Lawrence is the least helpful professor; he lets the students run amok 75% of the semester. And all you do is group work, so if you're an introvert, its that much worse.",0
He's literally just an audiotape of the words on the slides. He also will just have 2 midterms and a final for his classes. He gave us practice questions (just pulled from textbook) and said (after the average of the midterm was extremely low) that you shouldn't expect the questions to help you on your exams. Finals are cumulative.,0
"Just as a warning: Prof. Wolverton is probably the hardest grader in the UO's history department and I took many history classes here.  To get a good grade, go to her office hours and make ample use of the writing lab in PLC.  I did enjoy the class despite the difficulty and otherwise, she's a nice person and the class itself made me learn a lot.",1
"She assigns way too much work. Her discussion boards and current events are fine, but her worksheets are awful. Even with the textbook it's hard to find the right answers because she changes the wording and makes the questions confusing. I will be getting an A in this class, but it was not easy. I wouldn't recommend this prof if you want an easy A.",0
"layoun is an interesting person if you have a personal conversation with her, but her lectures are fairly useless. she takes attendance on random days(15% of your grade), so be sure to go. all you need to do is go to lecture and discussion, do the essays, and read all the books EXCEPT for the non-fiction ones, which you never need to account for!",1
"Not the best. Great guy with interesting life stories, but not the best teacher. Classes are unorganized, tests are awful and hard and make up most of your grade. Attendance is mandatory and he has no sympathy for outside circumstances. 5 question quizzes on every chapter. Do the reading and then some. Don't take him, he killed my GPA :(",0
If you haven't had physics this class will be extra hard. She talks pretty fast. Read the syllabus and show up.,1
"Professor Bailey is a very nice person and very understanding and an easy grader you get all the points by just doing the work. She does give many assignments, about 4 and 1 discussion post (busy work) a week & 4 essays. I recommend taking this class durning the summer & you also read an interesting book.",1
"He is a great lecturer, and has so much energy that it almost wakes up the whole class. The lectures are very note heavy, but it is not at all hard to keep up. There were a lot of quizzes, but they weren't really that bad, and as long as you study the notes or read the corresponding book sections, the exams are pretty straight forward.",1
"Dr. O'Hanlon is very caring and helpful. She doesn't tolerate any bull though and she sniffs it out instantly. This course is a heavy workload, but great for HR and business majors. You definitely want to get to know O'Hanlon and have her get to know you. She's very empathetic as it is, but it makes her less intimidating. Doesn't answer email.",1
"Quinlan is an amazing professor to have. He WANTS you to get a good grade and he helps you do so. His classes are almost all note taking, but you don't need the book! Pay attention to the notes and understand them because it's exactly what the test is on. Overall he's a sweetheart professor that just wants to see you succeed. TAKE HIM!",1
"She is a great professor and she taught me so much about wine. Her class is low stress and if you have any questions she is more than happy to help you. Attendance, two midterms, three short online quizzes, a short paper, a presentation, and a final - that's the entire class. Take Enology 15!",1
"Mrs. Waddel was a wonderful professor! I'm not ""mathy"" but managed to get an A and not have to take the final. There is a great deal of work in her class, because although the homework isn't mandatory, it is key to do to pass. Quizzes almost every day allow you to get a lot of points. If you are willing to put in the effort, a good choice!",1
She is one of the best professors I have ever had! The material is difficult but she makes it very interesting to learn. I would take her again!,1
Dr. Hale is one of the best professors I have ever had.  Yes you will work for your grade and you certainly won''t earn anything you don''t deserve but you will learn more than you could imagine.  He is always open to helping his students and he truly wants to see everyone succeed. ,1
"Okay, she is extremely vague in what she wants, yet she is such a hard grader when it comes to essays. Like i have professors in the 200 and 300 english classes giving me A's and A- on my essays, yet she gives me a C?!!! And i still dont understand what she wants from your writing. Class was very stupid.",0
"Loved her! She is open-minded, which allows for great class discussions that encourage different opinions. Interesting material and easy exams if you go to class and take notes. She's also really nice AND attractive! And this is coming from a gay guy, so trust me, it's not so bad to sit through her class.",1
Great professor who cares about students learning. Teaches in a way that is understandable and relatable. If there is a question he makes time before or after class to go through the material again and in a different way to ensure comprehension. I tried to get him for 1107 but my schedule wouldn't allow it. Asset to EFSC!,1
Awesome teacher! Very respected man in his department and he cares!,1
come to class. pay attention. do not disrespect her and she will not disrespect you. its as simple as that.,1
"I took bio 136 online & it was by far the most organized & logical online class I've ever had. The workload wasn't terrible, she has extra credit offered a few times & the tests come directly from the book/her power point. Met her in person & she's a great teacher all around. Super fast to reply to any questions over email. TAKE THIS PROFESSOR!",1
Dr. Holt is extremely easy.  All you have to do is 15 assignments all year and take open book exams.  The assignments consist of you typing some numbers straight from the book and sending them to him over the internet.  Extremely easy.,1
Pawkett makes it really easy to learn some very hard stuff about the guitar.  His class was awesome and the fact that he is hilarious makes it all the more reason to take his class.,1
"Super great teacher. Had for 101 and 199. Funny and easy to talk to. All the information can be re-found from the ppt online which is super helpful when doing work. As long as you pay attention in class and do the work your told to, especially in your groups, because there is a HUGE amount of group work, you should be fine.",1
"Dislikes: Talks fast through thought processes that he should really be writing down, clicker questions are not a great representation of tested material, exams are limited to only one hour so you have to race to finish. Likes: helpful one-on-one, makes practice exams available (best study material for this class), lots of grade buffers. Likable.",1
Scott is a great teacher.  He teaches with much clarity and makes Stats very tolerable.  Prior to this class I hated math and managed to get an A.  As long as you read the book (which is an easy read) and do the homework/labs you will do just fine.,1
He talks very low and monotone which makes it hard to concentrate on what he is saying. He does try to explain but his explanations are hard to understand at times. All homework is online which could be annoying.,0
"Group projects, discussion posts, and a couple of individual assignments. There's a lot of writing for this class. PPts and answering objectives is the best way to study for quizzes & exams. Otherwise it's an effort-based class more than anything else.",1
"JUDITH IS AMAZING. She is first off: BRILLIANT, and totally helpful!! She makes you feel like you can do anything and brings all of her experience to her teaching!Take a class with Judith! Any class! It doesnt even matter what it is, if she's teaching it; take it!",1
"If you are genuinely passionate and interested in psychology, this is a great class. The professor wrote the textbook for crying out loud. Taking it as an online class it is very self-directed obviously. Every communication or email received by the professor was pleasant.",1
"A brilliant professor that makes difficult math much more understandable.  This may seem evident, but this is a graduate class and you will need to work.  Regardless of workload, Professor Witelski is the best math professor I have had in the past seven year of university study; if you are going to take the course, take it with Professor Witelski.",1
"Incredibly difficult to work with, and rude when asked questions. Made up words like ""dramatical"" in an ENGLISH class.",0
"Outstanding Professor comparing with my learning experiences in professional courses at Universities in Canada, India and Africa. Great student engaging and performance supporting teaching methodology. An awesome personality who is very professional, helpful, friendly, open minded and supports students to reach our professional goals.",1
"He cares about his students, he wants us to do well. There is quiz every week, you really need to review and do your homework. He expects you to preview the next chapter before coming to the class. He is a good educator, knowledgeable, and passionate in his field. He got frustrated when students do not study, he means well though",1
"Mrs. Holmes is an amazing teacher. Yes, she gives lots of homework, but its worth it because she is outgoing,funny,caring, and really nice. If you want a fun teacher that actually cares about you passing math Mrs. Holmes is the one for you!",1
"Mr. Clark is a good professor, if you show up to class everyday and do the homework you should pass. your final grade is based on only three test grades so it is imperative that you do not fall behind and study a lot for the test. He posts past homework problems on blackboard and slides from class. There is homework every night never takes long.",1
"Dr. Suggs was great and showed that he genuinely cared. He's super passionate about music and his lectures were engaging. He never assigned much work and it was an easy A. We had a few short quizzes straight from the lecture, an extra credit quiz, and a final paper that he was super lenient about. Overall, great professor and not a stressful class!",1
"nice, funny and hilarious",1
"I took Calc in HS & got an A+, and got  a B- in this class. I'm in Calc 2 now and I learned more in the one week of review than I did my whole semester of Calc 1. He's a nice guy but his teaching is really all over the place. He doesn't explain anything in full and skips many steps assuming that we all are following his thought process.",0
"Sometimes kind of dry, but actually found some lecture pretty interesting. He is a stickler for attendance. Also, only one online final at the end. Would take him again",1
His classes are amazing! LOTS of reading but he genuinely cares about students and their success and comprehension of materials.,1
Has an very fun way of lecturing that made my a 3 hour night class go by very quickly and I can say I enjoyed it. The main part of your grade comes from a group project that you HAVE to spend time on. Gives two tests that are straightforward and are very easy to get a hundred on if you know how to prepare.,1
Her class is very straight forward! Just do the work and you'll pass!,1
This professor is one of the best.,1
i never thought i could write before i took this class.  i got all A's and i had a great time in class.  ms. trapp would joke around with us but she taught us so much.  i would definitely take another class with her. i never had a teacher that cared so much.,1
EXCELLENT!,1
"If you show that you care, show up to class, and do the work, Rachick will be an excellent teacher for you, no matter how bad at foreign languages you are.  As a Russian native, he speaks English very well and offers many insights into Russian culture and history throughout his classes.  I will be taking my third semester with him this coming fall.",1
"Very nice and funny but DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. He will not let you make up for anything, daily quizzes and read one chapter (20+ pages) per homework.",0
"Make sure to show up to every class. Attendance gets 10 points off every time you miss class, are on your phone, etc. Tests are straightforward and little work outside class is needed. Lectures are super fun and interesting. Dr. Knox makes things fun and relatable to students.",1
Weekly quizzes on textbook that majority of the class would do terrible on bc questions/answers wouldnt be clear or would be ambiguous/obscure ones from the textbook.  Luckily in grand scheme of things theyre not worth much. One 10-15 pg paper. Gave ec worth 50 pts. Attendance graded. Presentation on paper. No final. Last two wks is presentations,1
"Ree is a great professor. If you're interested its easy, but even if you aren't it's still pretty easy. Doesn't take attendance on project days (which last for usually a week of class periods) but show up otherwise you'll be lost. He is also really cute and a fun, laid back guy.",1
"Marek has a very successful engineering career and he has a very wide knowledge of the industry. But when it comes to teaching, HE IS TERRIBLE. He gives you general information about very specific stuff - and he expects you to know everything. His marking system is unstable and unfair. Lack of clarification is his the biggest problem. 3/10",0
"Ms lee is true professional she is amazing explain everything and you can understand very fast every problems, she goes through steps by steps also she is kind , I would like to take more classes for her",1
He is the best teacher at the university. He is inspirational and if you don't leave his class lecture thinking you are on top of the world then you weren't listening. He makes me go home and work hard to be successful. He cares about his students and is passionate about what he does. He is also in charge of the Engler Entrepreneurship program.,1
"Drops your lowest quiz and all quizzes are easily answerable. The discussions, however, are somehow tough because you have to be detailed by providing examples but not too brief to fit in your own opinion. Overall, a good professor and would take again.",1
"Terrible teacher! Absolutely hated her class! She cusses more than a sailor and it makes you really uncomfortable. She complains about the school she teaches @, other teachers, students and classes. she doesnt want to be there. She graded a work and gave me a D, another teacher said it deserved at least a B. She ""doesnt believe in perfection""",0
"Darwin is a great guy. Dry sense of humor, can be pretty dull in lectures, but he's a great guy who really cares about his students and loves the material. But for some reason, his exams are significantly harder than any of the practice problems or the text book problems. He curves which is nice, Definitely possible to get an A, but its not easy.",1
I had her in the spring of 2015 I didn't like her at all but now that i am in english 102 and my teacher is absolutely useless I realize how wonder Ms. Elise was!!!,1
She is very energetic and kind. She will give bonus when necessary and sometimes when not needed. Study the material and she will help you do well in her class.,1
"Omg. I love Mrs. McGee! She is the greatest biology professor. I'm just sad this is it, and I will never see her again. I would love her to be my biology professor forever. She is very funny, outgoing, and so sweet. I like the way she teaches. She is one of those professors that you will not find another one of.",1
"Definitely take her, esp for Honors sections. She's super caring and cares and highlights every students' achievements outside of class.",1
"she did a good job, but this class has a lot of work!",1
She is by far one of my favorite teachers!,1
"I had Dana at DePaul and everyone in this class talked about how much they loved her. Great personality, really wants students to engage in material and she made learning a new language so easy (very minimal hw and outside). Class is spent practicing so all you have to do are some short workbook pages. Highly highly recommend",1
Favorite professor in the music department! He cares about his students and is pretty funny!,1
"Dr. H expects way too much out of you for a gen ed. class.  She touches on topics for a brief period and then expects you to know everything in her mind. She babbles tons in class and is very disorganized with explanations  Do NOT take her class if you can avoid it. Tests are poorly constructed and subjective to ""how she feels"" like grading you.",0
"Cheap textbook, responds timely, and gives good feedback, very organized and straightforward, but holy moly so much reading, papers every week, tough quiz almost every week. You will have to read an entire book and then some. However if you put in the effort, I believe it is recognized and you will recieve the grade you work for. Planning is HUGE.",1
"Took his online class, a lot of work get ready to work and be committed to this class. A lot of reading, discussions and quizzes. He is a tough grader and I highly recommend you do not take him. The online class was very heavy and sometimes mis leading.",0
Bush is definitely the best torts professor at Hofstra,1
"A perfectly decent professor, but the same can't be said of her as a human being. Spent an introduction to Criminal Procedure berating an entire class for their uniformly poor performance on the Criminal Law exam rather than placing the blame on herself as the testmaker and arbitrary grader.",1
"Professor Lulejian interacts with the class and is very helpful. There were a couple of things I didn't like about the class: First, the tests seemed like they are setup to confuse you. Second, you aren't able to see what you got wrong on the tests, so you can't fix your errors for the exams. Other than that, it was a good class.",1
"Lectures aren't the most interesting, but he has a very forgiving exam policy. There are 3 exams, and he will drop your lowest exam grade if you went to class. You can also get a two-sided cheat sheet. The ""miniprojects"" are easy and usually has a good real life application. Homeworks slightly more difficult but manageable.",1
She's fine. Nothing great.,1
"Derek Chang is the best professor for any level of calculus. Seek him out for your calculus courses. Tons of homework, and he checks the homework, so don't slack here. Test are long, very long, but fair. Explains everything crystal clear. I wish he was department chair at csula. Derek Chang deserves a best teacher award or something like that. ",1
good class!,1
"He is really nice, but not the best professor.  He is very unorganized and doesn't really ""teach"".  He assigns HW  then just expects you to know the material for next class.  You have no idea what to expect on his tests (he won't even tell you the form of it, ex. writing section? vocab section? multiple choice?)  Overall- nice guy, bad professor.",0
"Professor Logue updated her announcements regularly, gave good feedback, and was helpful. The only con was that it took her quite long to update grades. Other than that, as long as you take the time to study, complete the course work on time, and ask questions, then you should do fine in her course.  I would definitely take Professor Logue again!",1
He is a tough grader but is clear of what is expected. He tends to go off topic a lot and talks really fast so it makes it hard to understand. If you are not able to reach him during his office hours then he will find time to meet and discuss assignments.,1
"Murtuza really cares about his students and loves teaching, he is also extremely nice and will help you anyway you need. However he is very very difficult to understand, he possess no organization ability. I do not feel I learned much and always felt the department exams were too difficult for me. From a class perspective there was not much work.",1
Lecture attendance isn't mandatory. Gives pop quizzes on occasions during recitation. The majority of his class assignments are on Wiley plus. Lecture exams were online through Wiley plus. Very nice and sweet person.,1
Dr. Jon visit class in China and have the deep thought and fun activity for our learning.  He is very nice man and good teacher.,1
"This guy is a f***ing chooch, I tutored half his class and he failed me. He said I cheated for helping the other kids to much.",0
"Online Class While I've had harder classes, I've never had a more useless teacher. He does nothing to contribute to the class and gives zero feedback on the assignments. If you state your opinion in the discussion board, you get an F for that week. If you feel like self teaching, go for it. Otherwise avoid this teacher at all costs.",0
"I was so fortunate to get Baumgartner for Lec AND Lab. I recommend him to every single person that asks. Compared to what I know about Noe & Evans, Baumgartner will be your absolute best chance at walking out of this class with an A (whoever said it's near impossible to get a C is so wrong). He cares about his students and that helps tremendously.",1
"Had him for computer programming classes, database, and combinatorics. Really nice and always willing to help. Tests aren't hard",1
"Prof. Reese, was amazing!!! I enjoyed his class. He has been the best teacher I have ever had in my college career. He is so flexible, understanding, and overall an amazing teacher. I truly wish he taught more subjects, because he is phenomenal! 10/10 recommend! You won't regret your decision of taking his courses.",1
"I love Ronda! She is a great teacher and she really pushes you (in a good way) so that you keep up. If you do the homework you will get a good grade, but you will have to do the work. She obviously loves her work and really wants you to succeed. She aspires to make the material understandable and interesting.",1
"Study for the exams and take the practice tests vs studying to learn the information. After the first exam he said ""if you are premed and didn't get at least 90% you should just drop out now and get a w, its better than a bad GPA and not getting into med school"". He also told students that if we did not understand this ""basic"" info to change majors",1
He is a great lecturer and is passionate about his material.,1
"He very experienced and teach us new technology and methodology like Agile, scrum etc.",1
"Brent's class is easy as long as you do the work, but if you really want to excel just ask him for advice and he'll make you the best.",1
Material seems unorganized for a class that is about organizing. Lots of reading and reading reactions as homework. Sometimes the assignments would not be posted until a day before they are due. The lecture slides make sense unlike the reading. Gives many chances to do extra credit.,0
Was really strict on grading and assigns too much reading. Also get ready to take lots of quizzes and write plenty of papers (750+ words each). With all that she has a dry sense of humor and doesnt keep her grades online. You have to do the math yourself so keep all your papers. Wouldn't take again. ,1
"Doesn't care much for students teacher does not help those in need only the ""teachers pets"" wouldn't recommend taking ANY classes from her",0
Ingeborg is really good teacher,1
"Gives opportunities for extra credit during lectures every so often, final project was fairly easy, and the only test was the final exam which wasn't insanely difficult at all. Handed it in online. Even for someone who doesn't care for art or literature it wasn't that bad",1
"Professor Draper teaches great courses, with a caring feeling for her students and a concern for future careers. She makes you want to do the work you NEED to do to move up in the world. You can tell that she wants to be in that classroom with so much energy, and talks about real events happening in the world off campus. Fair grader, smart lady.",1
"-Great, entertaining lectures -very caring -professor brings scantrons for his class",1
Great teacher. Take him,1
I enjoyed this class very much! I am going to take ENG 112 next semester. If you need to take ENG 111 BLANKENSHIP IS A MUST. Helps students when asked questions. Provides great feedback on essays. Midterm is a research paper that you do in two class periods and is there to assist. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED (:,1
Very good professor. Go to lecture and you will never have to study for the exams. Her tests are easy. There a few homework assignments but not a lot. Funny and knowledgeable. I wouldn't waste my money on the textbook. I never opened it.,1
"SL is a waste of time, Bude is a really nice teacher, but the class is terrible. I wouldn't mind doing the 30 hours of Community service but you also have weekly readings and forums which is tedious for a 2 unit class, then they want to shove PC down your throat.  Don't select MATE SL site. SL doesn't do anything CS related. Take KIN SL instead.",1
"She's great honestly, I think she is an amazing Professor. I'm so glad I got the pleasure of meeting her, if you see her name anywhere for classes take it I swear you won't regret it. She's kind, and cares about her students, loves her job and pays close attention to everyone. Take her course !",1
"Show up and you have an A. Most of the time, you don't even have to show up. Homework is really easy.",1
"Great teacher!  If you are expecting an easy A- not here. She loves her topic and shares that with the class.  If you come to class and do the assignments and study, you will do great.  I feel very prepared for the next level. Always willing to help.",1
Easy class as long as you keep up with your work.,1
"Professor Baddar was so inspirational! I learned so much in regard to the writings of Zora Neale Hurston, Richard Wright, Franz Kafka, and Gabriel Garcia Marquez. She will force you to think outside of the box when you try to interpret the literature assigned throughout the semester. You can learn a lot from her! Work hard and you'll earn an A.",1
She was horrible. Took her as my first class and there was absolutely no remorse for me as someone new to college and the hybrid format. She took the class way too seriously considering it's a required class and rather pointless in the age of the internet.,0
Great professor. Algorithms was very interesting.,1
"to the prev. rater: i suggest you pay attention in lecture as well as read the text. 1/3 questions from each...the other 1/3 are random, educated guesses needed..not too hard to pull at least a B. curve is insane",0
"I'm not one to use this application, but for this class, I'm going to have to make the exception. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. She is a tough grader, however she is also a very poor professor. She reads off the PowerPoint verbatim and is not good at answering questions. She has no problem teaching a chapter and testing you on it the same class. Overall, bad",0
She is an amazing teacher. I took this as a summer blended learning course (half online). It was my first class dual enrolling and she made it easy. She was so so sweet and always made sure to bring treats to class (sometimes homemade)! Simple work and fairly simple + easy. I would 110% recommend this class.,1
Very nice guy though a bit on the quiet side. Easy A.,1
Hes awesome! There is no way you could fail his class! Easy A!,1
His handwriting is sometimes hard to read and his lectures aren't very engaging. He is very nice and always accessible and willing to help. Wants his students to succeed and does reviews for all tests. Notes are posted online but if you're not great I recommend you to go to class. Textbook is not needed. 4 tests only but does extra credit.,1
"He makes learning about A&P easier, his lectures cover pretty much everything. He is always available for office hours, and has SI 2+ days a week. He does have an accent, but I could understand everything just fine. He has always been helpful and is great at making sure you really understand the material. I would take his clas s 100 times over!",1
He is a good teacher.  Funny.  You will need your text book for the class. You roll a dice to see if you have a quiz every day there is a 50/50 we had 3 all semester.,1
"Lectures and class work are boring and uninformative but attendance does help with your grade. Few assignments and reasonable amount of time to complete them. Make sure to read directions carefully or will need to revise. Only hard part was the 3000 word essay, other than that the class was a breeze!",1
BEST PROFESSOR ON THE PLANET. I wish he taught all the classes. Very VERY chill but you learn alot!!!!,1
She is a really nice lady and a good teacher but some of her assignments can be confusing as well as a little challenging. Just don't procrastinate on the readings and the homework or you will struggle. Shows a little bit of favortism to her students and can seem like the littlest things she can take out of proportion but other than that she chil,1
"I am so glad I took Professor Esposito's class. He made Greek drama exciting and fun. In other discussion classes I've had, the teacher will often say a prompt and no one will really have anything to say about it. In Esposito's class, the things he talked about were so interesting, and he himself was so engaging, that there were no such moments.",1
"Had a lot of really helpful tips to solve problems. Also told you a lot of concepts behind things so I had less to memorize. Really nice and approachable too. Test's are multiple choice. Gave out a well-written ""survivor guide"" which really helped me learn.",1
"I loved this online course! You constantly need to check canvas and know how to use the internet and you'll be good. He has due dates determined since beginning of course. RENT the book, you depend on it! Its not hard reading, its actually interesting. Just make sure not to slack on reading, i highly recommend making time. Its a great course!",1
"Might as well take calculus online because that's what you will be doing. The course is set up in a way that you watch videos every night and you have to TEACH YOURSELF calculus! He says that you can ask questions the next day but only answers maybe 2 at most because he is very unclear and disorganized. Avoid avoid avoid, trust me.",0
Unreasonable strict on grammar. More strict than my English professor.  It doesn't like a planning class more like an art class. Lots of reports  and analysis. Too much details to lose your mark. I would drop his class if it wasn't mandatory.,0
He is a very disorganized teacher and cannot explain the material well. Read the textbook and you should be fine for his class. I didn't go to his class during the second half of the semester and still received an A. Remember to give yourself time to do the homework and go to recitation. My recitation teacher game me quizzes every week.,1
"Joanna is amazing! She makes learning Hebrew a fun activity, not a chore and gives lots of helpful hints and explanations to remember spelling and grammar. You need to practice outside of class but it's not overwhelming amounts of work and class is always fun with videos and tangents about her daughter!",1
"She is a nice lady, but she is a harsh grader. You really have to earn your grade. I had to use outside resources a lot to come out with an A. It's hard, but it's definitely possible.",1
"If you can't draw, you'll have to compromise. Luckily I could draw very well when I took this class, so it was easy for me to grasp the concepts and execute them well. Skipping class won't get you a failing grade, but you should go to at least listen to his lectures about animation principles and techniques. He's very laid back and easy going.",1
"I took this class online. It was very easy and interesting. If you do the work, you'll do fine. She is a very fair grader.",1
He is the best teacher I have EVER had! He really loves what he teaches and you can see his passion for the subject. If you don't understand something he is ALwAYS there to help...you just need to ask. The study sessions before the tests are amazing and so helpful. The tests are easy if you study everything on the study guide and I mean everything.,1
He has a not so funny sense of humor. He don't come off as very caring especially since how he didn't know many of my classmates names. He grades averagely. His lectures are very boring. It makes me want to fall asleep and many people want to drop/ have dropped because he don't allow to make up quizzes which is 10% of the grade.,1
"Falk is an amazing mathematician and a fantastic professor. If you want to pursue a math degree, I suggest taking him. His class is difficult but you will learn a lot. It will be demanding but you will be better for it. I think he realizes that he is difficult and therefore grades accordingly. Be sure to utilize office hours if you can.",1
"Le pire prof que jai jamais u. Des examens qui ont aucun rapport, difficile pour rien !! Un examen cest faire pour tester la compréhension las pour faire couler le cours aux étudients. Plus jamais ce prof.",0
"Agatha was phenomenal! The course was taught entirely in German but she spoke slowly and clearly enough, and helped us with vocabulary. Incredibly knowledgeable about literature too. A great teacher and very kind!",1
"While the class content was pretty interesting, Prof Agol's unenthused voice made it difficult to stay awake sometimes. The work is generally very straightforward. I used a lot of quizlets online to study, and barely used the textbook at all except when the online homework directly cited when it would be useful.",1
"Really boring and too talkative about himself. Bored me to death, pretty easy grader, just uninspiring. Learnt way too much about his personal life.",1
I have a music background so I was able to breeze through the first half of the work book with ease. It's an online course so time management is key. Clear criteria for how the class works. Probably difficult for those with little to no music background. It is a hard subject! Knapp is accessible and knowledgeable but voice is monotonous online,1
He's a pretty good professor a tip for the final is know the formulas or you won't pass the final which is worth 45% of your grade. I would take him again. Also go to class because he takes attendance and gives extra credit for coming to class,1
Lane was great! I had him during the COVID-19 and we had to switch to online classes in the middle of the semester and he did not skip a beat! He was very helpful and answered any questions without hesitation! I would take him again without blinking an eye! As long as you go to class take notes and pay attention you will pass!! GREAT INSTRUCTOR!!!,1
"Frank is AMAZING! I love his classes! Wish he had more at Anoka Tech! Easy going and I learn a lot! He has a big heart and you have him for the next 20 years if you need him! He is the best instructor I have ever come across in all my years as a student! He helps students with résumé, just ask! What a generous man he is! I won't forget Frank!",1
"I don't understand how Prof Marks is receiving good ratings. He is the most intimidating, condescending teacher ever. I had planned on getting my Spanish minor before this, but this class completely turned me around 180 degrees. He looks at the ceiling when he talks, doesn't answer questions, and extensive homework is due daily. Just dreadful.",0
"She's really passionate. Although, her lectures can be confusing at times. Pay attention and go to office hours, always helpful. Her tests aren't hard if you study a lot, go to review and her office hours. She's really nice.",1
"Coop is a nice guy, but definitely the worst professor I have had. I currently have him for physics. It is not worth coming to class as he just rambles on and writes so small on the projector that it is impossible to read. I have never learned so little in a class. It's much more beneficial to spend class time studying on your own or with a tutor.",0
"I took Tompson after hearing PS101 was an easy-A class at BU. She is not the teacher if you want an easy A. She very engaging and a total genius, but her tests require knowledge from the book and the lectures so a lot of work outside of class is necessary to fully understand. If you want the easy A, consider another professor.",1
never met a more dedicated professor.,1
"LOVED her!! She is the sweetest lady. I only took her for BIO lab 118 (for bio 112) but I loved every minute of it. I always found BIO to be so hard, but she made it fun and understandable. I was so sad to see that she wasn't teaching lab for 113! Take her if you can, she is super helpful and an overall good teacher.",1
"I love this man. So helpful and incredibly sweet. Once you take his intelligence as adorably awkward instead of superficial, you'll appreciate his teaching so much more. You actually learn how to use the book you spent so much money on and use those skills for other classes. And his sense of humor is priceless!",1
"I've seen alot of negative comments on this site about this professor and feel I need to give him some props. Michel is an extremely hard working and dedicated instructor who is truly passionate about his profession. He won't let you slack off for a second, but if you make it through you'll realize how lucky you were to have such a great teacher.",1
"Chris was a great professor who I would take class with again. He is truly passionate about teaching, his class is very interactive from day 1. Three major group projects that are easy yet fun. easy midterm and no final if you compete every assignment and show up every day.",1
"Honestly, he's up and down. I've gone through the semester hating him and other times thinking he was okay. If he got rid of his condescension it would have been a more pleasant experience. When it comes to the work in the class, study for the lab quizzes and do your best, you will surely pass the class. ",1
"The professor was very easy-going. We only had four exams throughout the entire semester. All of them, including the final, were open book. I would highly recommend this class if science is not your main interest. However, beware of a lot of reading and often times difficult learning material.",1
"Professor Hensley really wants his students to get real-world information from his class, rather than just doing busy work. He is an amazing lecturer, very enthusiastic about business, and gives a lot of constructive criticism. However, there was a TON to do for one class.",1
"Took it online, the most work I (and the rest of the class) have ever done. Weekly, about 150 pages to read and an average 7 pages SINGLE-SPACED responses, on top of 4 projects. HORRIBLE grader. Completely not worth your time, effort, or GPA. DO NOT, DO NOT, DO NOT, DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR!",0
"He's very fair with grading. Just do the work he assigns and you'll be set. I made B's on 3 of the 4 online tests and still made an A because of the blogs. Never miss a blog post. Very strict about phones. If you have it out at all in class you'll be kicked out. If you have an A before the final, you don't have to take it.",1
He is a really nice guy.,1
"Oh my GOODNESS - I just want to say that Professor Dudley was the best professor I have had. However, if you are looking for an ""easy A"" this is not the class for you. You need to show up, do your work, pay attention (this is easy because she is hilarious and a great storyteller). I got the book but really didnt use it - all info in class on PP.",1
"Xing is hard to understand (accent), but she is a great prof. She wants to see thought process, not just relaying information. She also enjoys talking outside of class. This was an experimental class from my understanding, and some information was repetitive, but I did not feel stressed. Her grading is a tad harsh on essays I find, but not too bad.",1
"Ms. Pate is AWESOME!! She is a tough grader, by she gave vets great feedback! Show up to class, her class is fun! She is very understanding and she is a very visual teacher. I love her!!",1
"He was great. Super funny guy. I enjoyed taking the class, he likes to connect with the community and we did a fun service learning project. I thought the class was an easy A as long as you did what he asked. He is very approachable and if any thing is unclear just ask!",1
"One of the best teachers I've ever had.  Do the work, and you'll be rewarded.  Use your brain, you'll be rewarded further.  He doesn't have time for those who slack off, and will tell you so. Great preparation for actual employment as a legal researcher.  Wish I had more classes I could take from him.",1
"While not the most riveting class (ENGL 398 is required of all engineers), Dr. Parker seems to genuinely care about his students and their time. He has provided ample extensions given our schedules--and he realizes that although required, this class is not the first priority for us.",1
Follow the syllabus and you'll get an A no tests,1
"Professor Morales is honestly such an inspiration for someone like me who wants to become a foreign language teacher. He is extremely intelligent in all the languages he teachers, I think he knows 6-7? Extremely easy to open up to, hilarious, helpful no matter what, understanding, caring, and honestly I look forward to going his class everyday :)",1
"Not a fan of this prof. He rips your papers apart, and gives you a ton of homework. All he does is lecture and laugh at his own jokes. Choose a different prof to fill your requirement.",0
"Shimul definitely cares about his students' success in the class. He cuts out the lowest tests, quizzes, and homeworks, making it easier to get an A. That said, his accent is very heavy and he can be hard to understand sometimes, but his grading system makes up for it in my opinion.",1
"He was not clear on what he wanted done, therefore the majority of the class including myself kept getting bad grades. Then when you would try to get a hold of him he would not respond in a timely manner nor answer our phone calls. Do not take this class with this professor unless you want to fail.",0
I loved torts! This man is truly a character and you will only pass by truly reciprocating his exact instructions. Outside sources will not help you because he teaches through his own language. BUT BEWAREyour grade will only be based on the final! Outlining early is the key to success.,1
I think prof zeman is one of the best instructors I ever had.  I took her this past summer for microbiology lab.  Even though it was a consolidated summer course I feel she kept the material interesting and easy to understand.  I learned so much from her which will come in handy for my future nursing career.  Would def take her for another course.,1
I have to disagree with most of the comments on here. I like his class and understand they way he teaches. He expects yo to put your time in your work. He goes over exactly what he grades on in class and gives examples. He does try to help students during class but at the end you get what you earn.,1
This was a very easy online class. The basis of the class is either a quiz or journal (2 page paper about what you learned) and a discussion board every week. He gives all of the dates the assignments are due and what chapters to read for each week in the syllabus. If you keep up on the readings and do your work you will get an A.,1
"Wasn't a fan of the class, she did not seem to care for many people had her select favorites, not a good class for a Caucasian male(history of urban america) class was very anti white",0
"Dr. Monroe is probably the best teacher i have had at OCC. Lectures are very inclusive and will always stop to better explain something. No electronics rule allows you to really focus on the great content. HW for every chapter but the minimum requirement for it is very easy to meet. Grading is clearly laid out. Do the HW, study, pay attention  A.",1
"Too much reading, I do not learn my reading 30 pages of information and then taking 4 different tests on it. I will NEVER take this class again. I just had a mental breakdown over this class and I'm over it.",0
"If you are willing to work, he will help you.",1
"He completely killed any passion I had for Math. I went into this class excited to progress my Math learning, and he shriveled up my dreams like a raisin in the sun. I cant tell you enough DO NOT TAKE HIM, you WILL fail. This is not a challenge, please save yourself  He's got an alright sense of humor though BUT do not take him.",0
"The good thing about Scanlon is that he will try to help you whenever you ask for help. However, he is a very sarcastic person and downright rude. Sometimes he will embarrass you in front of the whole class. He also very hard to understand because he doesn't explain things well. He also raises his voice a lot.",1
Very informative class. Instructor encouraged the discussion and expression of differing viewpoints in light of common ground.,1
"He is seriously the best proff at UM-Dearborn.  The man is like 70 something, rides his bike to work, and walks in the field for 8 hours/day.  He obviously loves the environment, teaching, and his students.  He is not kidding about the amount of time spent on the notebook but if you do it everyday, you will pass.  Very smart  but not condescending.",1
The best professor in the school.,1
"Good professor, explains things, good class",1
"Very respected, helping , and caring about his students, one of the best prof in bmcc. his lectures are amazing and heavy at the same time. he would go over anything again if you didn't understand. Tests are heeaavy but he prepares you well for it and give a practice test. DEFINITELY RECOMMENED HIM",1
"Attendence is mandatory. If you miss a class, your grade will immediately be affected. His lectures are somewhat boring but he does explain well. He loves to talk about environment and seems to love the Earth. Tests were difficult, but he allowed a double-sided cheat sheet.",1
"I really enjoyed her class. As long as you go and really try on the papers, it's an easy A. Theres 3 papers with pre assignments before them and lots of help from her to get information for your papers. No final, just a portfolio of previous work. She's a fun and laid back professor. I would take classes with her in the future.",1
A nice professor and i learnt a lot.,1
"The class is based on one big project. Attendance in mandatory. Her guidelines for the assignments sometimes are the opposite (literally) of what she wants. For example, one assignment we did was a survey with open-ended questions, after turning it in she said she ""said in class"" she wanted closed-ended questions. Staff loves her, I'm not sure why.",0
"Would NOT recomend taking this class. Claimed that seeing our grade online was ""unnecessary"" and when asked for one-on-one help, always had an excuse to get out of helping you. It was obvious that even she wasnt very familiar with the material and when asked questions, she would try and avoid the subject. ",0
"I took this class as a GPA booster and boy was I wrong. For the midterms, Mary gave us the format and told us to review the 16+ lecture slides. Too much information and I didn't know what to focus on so it was hard to study for the exam as it was too broad. The info was also all mixed up and hard to follow :(",0
"hate this class! had tutor, read book, did online stuff and no help from her. learned more from outside group. Horrible teacher!",0
Very smart and can be amusing at times which makes the class more enjoyable.,1
"HE'S SO AWESOME so caring so nice, hes really willing to help you out if you are willing to see him in his office",1
"Loved Dr. Storslee, he was always considerate. I took the teacher several times for a lot of my courses. He had taught at ASU so he naturally does things fast-paced, but is willing to slow down. Is willing to give you opportunities to complete work that was missed or to come in for office hours for extra help. Also gives extra time after class.",1
"Professor Baez class consisted him of going over powerpoints in class then assigning homework through saplinglearning. Here the homework consisted of mostly multi choice questions you can find online. There was one midterm, one final, one research project and overall it was a great class and I learned a lot about economics!",1
"I had a bad TA which really killed the class considering there were two discussions a week, but the one lecture we would have was excellent. She infuses humor and intellect brilliantly. A terrific professor.",1
"This is a good class to take if you have others you want to focus on during a semester. She just gives you the answers the class before the test and you write an open book paper every other day. However, if you desire to learn anything your better off with someone else.",1
Great professor!!!! He was willing to accommodate during the pandemic and workload is super manageable. Material was easy to digest and exams were pretty easy. I highly recommend this class to non-STEM majors. The one negative thing I can say is that feedback was not given on assignments and I was often unclear as to why points were taken off.,1
good teacher.  tough but fair decent sense of humour,1
"Mandatory attendance only for labs. In the end, if you aren't doing so well in class she offers help in any way she can (Extra Credit, homework redo etc). Really cares that you pass. Material is fairly hard (not for slackers) but she is an easy teacher. Final exam not mandatory (can replace one bad exam grade). 4 exams, hw online, lab quizzes.",1
This man is amazing makes you feel comfortable since day one ! If you ever have a question he will provide his phone number for you to contact him or his email. He makes history look fun as well ! Wish more teachers can be like him.,1
Make sure you show your work or it will be counted wrong even if you have the right answer. Look forward to pop quizzes and pay attention.,1
I really enjoyed his teaching style. It allows you to be a bit more independent and not have to study for quizzes or tests. He's funny and welcoming. I definitely recommend him,1
"Great professor, you have to study.  Explains everything when you have a question, exams are tough, but if you study you will do well.",1
"Awesome teacher! Knows his stuff and gives you plenty of chances to catch up, but his class is fail proof! Show up, do your work & pass! Thank you Mr. Bonilla!",1
"Amazing professor! Loved her course! You can tell she loves what she teaches. She's also super nice, understanding and helpful.",1
Great professor!,1
i love mis magdaleno she is the best teacher i have this semester =] i wont her for my color fundamentals class!!,1
This class was alot of fun. He makes the lectures fun to listen to and easy join. Tell lots of stories that relate to the topic at hand. He's there to teach not too grade so showing up and participating are a sure way to pass yhe class with an A or B.,1
"Tries so hard but I do not understand him...can't explain, but really nice guy",1
"Mr. Humphrey is amazing! His lectures are informative and entertaining. His study guides are very accurate and if you take good notes and participate, you should absolutely pass! My class was converted to online halfway through the semester, but Mr. Humphrey remained positive and rewrote the syllabus to allow full credit. 100% recommendation!",1
"I love him! I am a cs student and he was very easy even though I had a tough time with Biology in high school. Seems to only care if you learn or not, very easy grader. He is also very sassy but also hilarious. He loves futurama. As the other person has said though, he is terribly disorganized. He also always ends class early.",1
"Great professor, the course was interesting, follow the syllabus and youll do great. Prof. Pfeifer was communicative he provided feedback and answered emails almost instantaneously. The man is more than fair, the work for the course is manageable providing you stay on top of it. Midterm and final are written essays highly recommend",1
Such a nice and easy professor i loved his class,1
"This class was a breeze. Everything that's on the test can be found in the powerpoints. Bonus points for not missing more than 2 classes. Easy A+!! Too bad she is retiring, I was lucky to take her class before it's too late.",1
"I took Mrs. Sanborn for two semesters and she is by far the most helpful teacher that I have ever had. When going over the material she is very clear and helpful, she will make sure that you understand the material she is teaching. There is NO way you can fail her class unless you do not do the work, but she is beyond helpful, wonderful teacher!!",1
"She is very passionate about ASL, stresses that you have to participate in order to learn. You definitely need to pay attention and realize that this is another language not a breeze through easy class.  Practice is KEY!",1
"Overall, had a good semester. Dr. Parker was approachable and helpful. He consistently listened to feedback from students to make our workloads better.",1
"Tami was a great teacher that really cares about her students understanding the content. Very patient and willing to help. Exam review guides were great, no curve-balls during exams. She is very clear on what she expects on homework and exams.",1
Outstanding teacher. Math isn't the easiest for some of us but she is more then willing to help. She'll extend due dates for assignments if to many students in the class are struggling. Comes in once a week  an hour early for a pre class workshop for students who need a little extra help. Easy to talk to and super smart.,1
"Very helpful, always willing to answer questions. Go to class every time and you cant go wrong",1
"He's great will work with you!! he's amazing, super nice and you'll get the material.",1
"He moved very slowly through the material and it could be dull at times. Going to class is optional however, half way through the semester, all students who were in class got a 2% bonus in their final grade.",0
"Great instructor, explains things well, she let me re do an assignment for a better grade. She definitely holds the attention of the class and is really informative. I would take another class from her most definitely.",1

"I took the online Statistics course this Fall 2019 semester. There is no interaction between yourself and other students, but he responds in a timely manner. A decent amount of homework, media assignments are helpful. The tech was easy to understand, and provides a lot of opportunity and resources for success!",1
Doug Dowell is easily one of the best professors Ive had at ISU. His classes are very easy to follow because he cares about his students and their success. He makes it easy to understand things because of his knowledge and passion on the subjects. Highly recommend! He is such a nice guy and you will not regret it.,1
He is a nice guy that really cares about how well the class is doing. Just make sure you study hard for the exams and do the homework. Reviewing during the off-weeks helps.,1
There are participation points where you have to comment on something in the lectures. There are 3 papers in the class but he only keeps the highest grade. The class was hybrid this semester so I barely went to class and still got an A. He's really chill and funny. 10/10 would recommend,1
One of the coolest professors ever. She makes the class welcoming and uses humor. Keep up with your work and enjoy the class discussions!,1
Very good teacher i wish that i colud have him agin.,1
"I am astounded by these comments. Patti is LU's finest English professor. She is consistently intelligent in lectures, and helpful in her feedback. She actively engages with students' writing on even the most mundane papers. And the comments that imply she is unduly harsh to male students are simply untrue.",1
"Coop is interesting, funny, and understanding, yet he is extremely hard to understand and follow even the most basic algorithmic foundations. He s a good person, not a good professor.",0
"She was the only option for 360, and my advisor. I don't want to speak badly about her because she does care and she works hard. Her class is super time consuming, like she doesn't realize that we have other classes to focus our efforts on. I wouldn't advise you take her course if you don't have to. But if you do, make sure you can manage your time",1
first impression was a strict b*^!h. turns out Roxy's pretty cool,1
Had him for First Year Seminar. Really nice guy and tries to help you as much as he can. Would take for another class if I could.,1
This rating has been removed as per our site guidelines.,1
"He knows the materials and he knows them well. I don't know if he's helpful in his office or not, but the lecture comes right of his head. Makes small mistakes at times. READ the book at least once before or after the lecture. DO the homework and sample quizzes and tests and you should be fine.",1
easy A just watch the lecture videos,0
"Cool professor who cracks dorkish computer science jokes and teaches pretty well. Taught CS70 with Vazirani and took the backseat, but involved with tests and homeworks.. sometimes questionable practices of finding questions online and assigning them without knowing the answers.",1
"She is a waste of space.  Totally useless, living in the 80's.  This class, on the whole, is a waste of time and just a way for SCC to get money.  She thinks she is funny, she is not.  She claims you need the book, you do not.  She likes to be the grammar and spelling police when most of her work is laden with errors. The class is a complete waste.",0
Great teacher. Really thoughtful! Encourages students to do best work but also very patient with learning process. Has a linguistics background which helps A LOT to understand the language. Highly recommended!,1
"He is one of the best professors that I have had at UCI. Yes, there is reading, but if you pace yourself you will survive. Ask for help and he'll give it to you. After exams he gives the opportunity do get a notch up on your grade. Great professor, knows his stuff. ",1
"delightful, helpful, and a great teacher",1
"This is a useful course. Professor Mahallati explains the text, because the text and Content is dense. Worth the work though.",1
Dr. Hudepohl is very passionate about her work and it reflects in her teaching style. Expect to devote a lot of time to this course in terms of projects and reading.,1
No Comments,1
Very helpful. Knows what he's talking about. A professional in his field. Very funny,1
"Dr. Pittman is an amazing professor. She is really caring and tries her best to make sure you understand. She is very accessible outside of class and answers emails timely. The class is well organized and you will know all of your due dates at the beginning of the semester. Additionally, she grades fairly and gives good feedback.",1
She is a sweetheart. She wants everyone to love her class. She can be confusing with her assignments. A lot of group work.,1
"This is a late posting but had to write this up.  Excellent teacher, very helpful in all aspects of course study.  he expects you to do the work but he is also very fair and if you have issues and go see him he will work with you.  I would take again with other courses.",1
I would definitely recommend her .,1
"Hes a really awesome professor! I really enjoyed his class. Yeah hes lectures are long, but you learn a lot. Best Astronomy professor!",1
Lemenager knows how to grab the attention of his students for lectures. The study guides he gives  test. You are required to write 10 pages of collegiate writing for his class but he breaks it down into 2 papers 5 pages each. He gives extra credit every once in a while so make sure you take advantage of the extra credit.,1
"Mr Trower is nice and his class can be easy, but he makes it kind of hard to pay attention honestly. He doesn't simplify the math speech and he speaks into a monotone voice. I learned more from mymathlab.",1
"Hard, but amazing.",1
"Mrs. Jimmerson is a very good teacher. She helped me so much! She is really funny which makes class go by fast! she gives extra credit! Although she is a good teacher she is kind of a hard grader, she just knows what she wants. You must follow directions in class! If you do follow directions you will do fine! ",1
this teacher is so disorganized. He was always all over the place for every lecture. Obviously smart and guy and has hundreds of students but dude needs to get his ish together,0
"Though homework was optional, it is strongly encouraged that you do it because she takes exact problems from the homework and puts them in tests and quizzes. I received a 68% on the first test and got an A+ on the rest and got an A in the class. She gives a lot of partial credit and some extra credit on her exams. Should be an easy A.",1
"Professor Guzzone was overall a great professor. He was occasionally unclear about specific assignments or what was going to be on the test but if you ask questions to be clear, you should be fine.",1
"Great teacher!  She is professional & fast paced.  She really cares about the success of her students.  I learned so much from her, I highly recommend her for class, just be prepared to work hard.",1
"One of my favorite teacher!! Don't mess around in class or she will call you out on it. Textbook, tests and homework are done online and she is very good about helping. Sometimes it's hard to understand her, but she tries hard to make it clear. Very on top of everything including grades. Concerned about her students, always willing to help.",1
"She is a very sweet professor and will help you if you ask for it, but the class itself is very lecture heavy and can sometimes be boring. The final is a group project, which is easy but the quizzes in class can sometimes be difficult.",1
"Very knowledgable, good conversationalist. Holds attention with ease. Not an easy A but you will pass if you try hard.",1
"The professor gives really good feedback and even lets you correct your tests. There is assignments weekly so its better to get them done as soon as you can as the week passes by quickly. Other than that, this class was relatively easy as long as you know what you're doing.",1
"LA is the best professor at Carleton. She sets up the course so that students have a chance to succeed if they work hard. She has an amazing background & is helpful in every way. I would LOVE to have the chance to take another course with her, and I am signing my fiance up in her class for the fall!",1
I would recommend her! Very helpful. Explains things very well. In class assignments and homeworks are pretty straight forward. Three exams. The first exam I found difficult just because she has to throw so much at you but the next two are pretty easy. Loved her class! She's passionate at she does and she knows her sports!,1
He was very good in my opinion. He had good in class discussions. He was very clear on understanding when things were due and when quizzes and test were. If you go to class you will do just fine.,1
I took Perez for Race and Ethnicity and it was good. It was a 500 person lecture hall but I was lucky enough to get an awesome TA (Frank Perez). Going to lecture was long but still really cool to listen to Perez lecture. There is also a couple quizzes and they're all spread out. Your main grade is in the discussion class. I definielty recommond!,1
DO NOT TAKE!! Failed to communicate - took 3 weeks to answer questions regarding mid-term. Mid-term and final are essay formats. He is not organized and doesn't seem to be engaged or knowledgeable. Do yourself a favor and choose another professor.,0
"Prof. Prasad is great. She does give reviews, they just entail what you need to know for the test. Furthermore, she spends an entire class period reviewing. Chemistry is hard but the use of the K-Learns, her lectures, and class / group work is beneficial. I enjoyed this professor very much, she genuinely cares about your success.",1
"Yes, this teacher was very funny. But he was more concerned with quickly cramming   information than going over problems to help the class understand. Answering questions was either hit or miss depending on the amount of topic he had left to cover that day. Maybe not the teaching style that works best for me but I didn't feel like I learned a thing",0
"Lectures are the best way to learn for her. She is a very good lecturer, but her material is almost straight out of the book which meant that I didn't read it that much. Attendance is mandatory, but lectures are fairly interesting.",1
"He's young and really engaged. If you work hard, you'll be a better writer at the end.",1
"This class was hard if you do not study or use SI as a resource. During lectures he tells you what will be on the exam. I can't emphasize enough how SI helps you pass this class. I will say this again, SI is so helpful and only reason why i passed. You must study 1-2 weeks in advanced for this class because last minute studying will kill you.",1
Study guide equals test. Funny guy but the class does get boring somedays. Must attend class to pass,1
"Awesome guy. Comes off as not very nice, but he just has a dry sense of humor. Knows what he's talking about. Learned a lot in his classes!!! Show up to class, participate, & take notes and you'll be fine.",1
"I'm not crazy about his teaching style, nor do I think his powerpoint/lectures are well put together. With that said, he is a very intelligent man w/ a sense of humor. As a working paralegal he is able to tell you about how things really show down in the field. You are going to work in his class, but you come out appreciating it. I recommend.",1
"Avoid this man at all costs! The exams are 8-10 multiple choice questions with at least 8 choices per question, so there is absolutely no partial credit, even if you do the entire problem correctly and just make a miscalculation.  His lectures are boring, his explanations are complicated, and he doesn't seem to care very much about his students.",0
"Jon Judge is the reason I passed Calc 2. The guy is just really good at teaching math. I think he understood that our professor was awful and ended up just reteaching all the content during our discussion section, meaning that I never went to the lecture and still got an A in the class.",1
"He's a really interesting person and gives really interesting lectures. Makes good jokes, but its up to you whether that is worth the immense amount of reading you'll be doing. You have weekly readings and quizzes and you won't be able to make up one you missed. Make sure you take notes and don't be on your phone. He will call you out.",1
Overall not a great help. Would not recommend to friends.,0
"Awesome professor. Extremely interesting and great at lecturing. His labs are interactive, fun and actually worth your time.",1
"This was the first semester she was trying out a new pass/fail grading system (spec grading) and she provided plenty of information in the syllabus/articles/in class on how she was grading. It overall made it easier to get the grade you wanted, however, she wanted the hw/projects to be near perfect to pass which could be frustrating",1
"I enjoyed this class. It was an easy A for me. As long as you were there to hear his lectures, you were sure to get A's on the quizes. He even let you use a freebee quiz as a replacement if you missed one.",1
"Very fun class. The materials she made us read were interesting. Teaches the material towards the papers, so all you have to do is reguritate that information into a 3-4 page paper. I actually don't mind English now. Easy to look at, too. ;)",1
"Cest sans aucun doute le meilleur prof que jai eu. Il est direct, il na pas la langue de bois et il utilise des figures de style lorsquil parle. Il y a beaucoup de vérités dans ce quil dit. Il ma donné de très bon conseils pour ma vie. Cest un vrai de vrai et un gars avec un grand cœur. Derrière sa stature un être sympathique.",1
"Once you learn Dr. Royce's quirks, he's the best professor you'll have. He puts a lot of effort into his lectures and his classes are useful. I took 3 classes with him. Received A's in all, but also gave it my all. Best online experience I've had with a teacher. He's engaged with his students.",1
"Very good teacher, funny.  Tests are super hard and require A LOT of studying and you must apply the material.",1
Richard is the best!!!,1
He is very accessible and his letters are always interesting and helpful. Every part of each assignment is reiterated over and over again so it's very hard to be confused in this class. All of the class content is organized and available on the course website.,1
"SHE WAS great, the class was kind of hard but she really  helps you.",1
Dr. McCabe is easily one of the best Bible teachers I've had. His classes are challenging and involve a lot of work but you will get so much out of it. He makes learning a ton of fun and his lectures are very active.,1
"Dr. Hale is a very difficult grader and requires a lot of his students but if you actually care about history and are interested in the subject, there is no other teacher that I would recommend more. I have learned so much in every course I have taken with him. He also cares and is realistic.",1
"Kubota-sensei is a very caring individual. Our class has immensely enjoyed her teaching and I highly recommend her as a professor. She is willing to go the extra mile to help you understand the material, and although she may be intimidating at first, she really is a good soul. Get to know her, and she will bloom into your life.",1
She is the nicest prof I've had so far. She will give all the help you need as long as you respect her and ask. She is very clear and had fun papersprojects. The class was a bit too easy for me but I still enjoyed it. Easy AB. Great teacher and very caring too.,1
Brooke is by far one of the best math teachers. She goes over any problems that you may have had with the homework she assigned to you. You can go to her after class and she will take the time to show you one on one how to do each step in problems. Her tests are challenging but easy if you do the work. I would take her again in a heartbeat.,1
"He's an alright guy. Definitely knows his stuff. I agree though, he can come across as arrogant. He can be harsh on students, but he usually picks on goofs.(Why do they even come to class? To complain here?) He really does try to make Econ understandable. Gives notes online and lays out everything that will be on the exam. Good teacher imo.",1
He isn't the easiest to understand but he is very helpful. He gives lots of extra credit and plenty of chances to do well on the test also you get like 2 take home tests :) Great teacher,1
"I had a lot of trouble getting him to answer my emails about my grades being incorrect more than once. He was friendly in person to talk to, but never got him to answer my emails till the very end of the semester. You should be fine on tests if you take good notes, but were only short answers. Assignments were decently easy for the most part.",1
"She is a very nice professor with a very clear explanation for each question. By reading the PPT she provided, and do all the practice, it is easy to pass. She also provided 3 grading policy and she will be based on your grade to see which policy was best for you. Also, she will curve the exam, so you don't need to worry about not passing her class",1
"I took EDUC 2110E as an online class for the summer. It is only a month long so it is very fast paced. Overall, I enjoyed the course. It is very important to read the text book. If you keep on the work, it is very easy to do well in his course.",1
"He's very nice but his class is lecture heavy. His interest is in entomology, and this was a beginner biology class. His exams are pretty easy as long as you study and use the study guides that he posts. He assigns readings for lectures, but I never actually read, but I'm sure it would help your grade if you did.",1
"I LOVE Professor Goodman! His voice is really monotone, which isn't great, but he's got a good dry sense of humor. He's really understanding about absences or turning things in a day late if you've got a good reason and usually come to class on time & contribute. He taught me a lot even though I'm not gonna be a PE teacher.",1
Can I give you some advice? Don't take a class with this prof if you can avoid it. Trust me on this one.,0
Stunning as well as electrifying.,1
"Prof. Anthony is approachable, kind and cares about your success. Though it is challenging to score an A on written assignments and tests, she gives enough opportunities to make up for it. She responds to emails promptly and is always patient in office hour meetings. Would DEFINITELY recommend. :)",1
Extremely unhelpful and cancelled office hours frequently.  Tests were very difficult and had questions that weren't anything like our homework or lecture examples.  He used different notation and equations than our textbook which made following him in lecture difficult.  Doesn't post any lecture notes or solutions to homework or tests online.   ,0
He is a cool dude. Go to class and do the work and you will be fine.,1
"I learned a ton in his class. He's very thorough. Lots of notes, but interesting. Definately quirky.",1
This was not a class that I needed for my major but I wanted to take it due to I am a business owner. I felt it was the first class I have taken business wise where the instructor knew what he was talking about. I also felt like the class applied to today's world.,1
"Class consists of a quiz every week on that weeks chapter. You knew exactly what you needed to do to prepare, which was VERY nice. It also made it easy to study for midterms and finals. Loved the structure of the class, and although lectures can be a little dry there is always something interesting to learn from them.",1
Jeff is a great guy! He offers alot of help and I had him for PPS so the class was insanely easy to begin with. Do the work and it isnt hard my little sister could probably pass the class but Bryant has to have a intro computer course so take this guy and you'll do fine. The only thing I didn't like was it was at 8am,1
"Loved him! You learn alot in his class. His main goal is to have you think and not rely on some one telling what to do. Take him if you can, he is one of the best!!",1
"She was expected you to know everything in class. When you visit her office hour, she just shows you the rubric she gave, and let you read about that. I would not recommend her unless you want to write discussions (600 words) + survey per weeks + weekly quiz, and 12 pgs (2800 words) for midterm and 24 pgs (4500 words) for the final+final exam.",1
Jana is an excellent teacher.  There is no guessing with her.  She tells you exactly what she expects.  Her tests were over her notes.  The group activities were fun and her assignments were few but definitely a learning experiance.  I highly recommend any class with her.,1
"Mrs. Fujimoto is an extremely smart and respectable teacher. She is sweet, compassionate, understanding, open minded, and has a awesome 'old lady' sense of humor. I will very much miss having her as an English teacher. If your looking for a 'different' type of teacher, Mrs. Fuji is a great option to consider.",1
"So kind and understanding, and give out a number to contact her with. She gave extra credit when the class did poor on the exam. ended up with over 100% score on test. very understanding about homework extensions.",1
"lit guy to be honest... those complaining are nagging babies, pull your own weight for this class and it's an easy A. Be grateful if you have him",1
i think this teacher is ridiculous. He would rather drop students then help them. i know someone that supposedly failed a test and when they asked to see it he told them that he threw it away! he also  belittles students in the class room when they are trying to ask questions and get help,0
"While very unclear on due dates, essay format specifics, etc., Shira is a very interesting person with a unique way of thinking. He has experienced a lot, and has many lessons/stories to tell just from what he has experienced through life. He is not a harsh grader, and as long as you truly put your heart into your assignments you will do just fine!",1
"Claudine is super sweet, and caring. She's always wiling to hear your thoughts and help you out.",1
"By far the absolute BEST prof I have had! He easily ties things together to make the material quite understandable. He is extremely effective with his lectures, so do NOT miss them! He will always hint to you what is on the exams. Extremely easy to approach and you are always met with a smile. Best course hands down I have ever attended!",1
"Koehler is a really sweet guy and teacher. You only write one paper and theres little to no homework. His tests are super easy, just study a bit.",1
"His lectures are hard to comprehend. You must be willing to read the book and watch videos to understand the concepts. His HW are unnecessary, just copy them, but understand a few. His exams are doable, study the past and know the concepts. Easy Subject in General Communication. I think Electronics & Signal Processing are tough. Keep Studying!",0
Brutal,0
"Has no clear guidelines but expects so much. He gets mad when the class does bad but when you ask him what to study, he'll call it ""fishing for answers."" ""Fishing"" makes him even madder and he says if we ""fish"" the test will get harder. He asks questions on content he hasn't taught and expects you to know it.",0
"She was awesome, great feedback. Video graded rough draft assignments with attached notes. My only wish with her was that the course was longer than 8 weeks. I hope I have some class she teaches in the future, I did get the B. But I am not the best writer in the world.",1
"She spends the entire class talking about herself and doesn't actually teach the material, yet when it comes time for the tests she expects you to know anything. Avoid this teacher at all costs!",0
"Ok, I am an IT major.  I am taking CIS at the same time as PPS and what I am learning NOW in PPS, I had to teach MYSELF for the beginning of the year for CIS. A great Professor tho. I know him a little better because he stops by Laptop Central often.",1
"Dr. Draper is a remarkable professor. Shes thoughtful, knowledgeable, supportive and works tirelessly to help students succeed. Ive taken 2 classes with her and I can honestly say that Im better for having done so.",1
"Professor Perkins is one of the best professors at Fordham. I took both of my theology courses with him and would take another class with him if I had the time. I really like his style of teaching &he picks texts that are relevant, and fun to read. He has interesting lectures and really cares about his students. Honestly can't recommend him enough.",1
"Wonderful to work with. Learning math through Wildman is attainable. He's an excellent teacher with solid communication skills, passionate, and has a natural talent for teaching math. He cares about student success in his class and that helps engage students.I had no math skills prior to taking his classes. Thank you!",1
Fantastic lecturer! A crucial course if you have any intention of conducting your own research and Dr. McDonald makes the material easy to understand and adds humor into the mix to keep the class engaged.,1
"Don't know what everyone is complaining about. Funny guy and the class is not hard at all. Lots of outside group work but he is very helpful if you just ask. Just study, ask questions, do the work and you'll be fine.",1
"Take him!!! Awesome professor who is super passionate about what he teaches. Tests are easy as long as you do all of the readings and look at powerpoints. He uploads all of the readings and ppts, so you don't have a textbook for the class. Lots of class discussions with lectures.",1
"Honestly, a great teacher. He goes out of his way to provide a weekly homework help section, and will also have out of class reviews for exams. Example problems are well done and thorough, and he teaches how to do the physics, rather than just to use the equations. HOWEVER, his exams are challenging, so be aware of that!",1
Im conflicted about professor Allen. The class itself isnt hard but he makes it harder than it should be. He gives TONS of worksheets that you basically figure out how to do yourself. I felt like I taught myself the entire semester. He hardly ever gives a straight answer to questions and isnt clear on instructions. He can be condescending too.,0
Teaches very boring. Long and unnecessary. Hyprocrite,0
This teacher is great!  She is so helpful and really cares about her students.  If you don't like her theres something wrong with you.  I want to adopt her.,1
"I found the assignments long and challenging. Which, I respect. All around great professor, responds very quickly just put in effort and schedule other classes accordingly. Work hard play hard.",1
This prof truly wants everyone to learn. He is kind and makes the class applicable to the real world. Even tho he is new at teaching he makes it very fair for students to succeed. The class is weighted easier than any other accounting class (less% on tests and more on actual work). If youre a good student and do all the work you will do great,1
"Easy.  But frustratingly, irritatingly, infuriatingly, mind-bogglingly inane classes.  If you seek to learn, do not look here.",0
He is a clear communicator with a well prepared structure to his lectures. Asks for class ideas a lot and gets discussions going. Definitely need to take good notes and study to do well on the tests. Full class session reviews before tests. Your expected to study and know all the material. Two papers. Good extra credit opportunities. Great teacher.,1
Professor Back is the best teacher I've ever had at ELAC! She prepares the notes for you so you just print them out and get to actually pay attention instead of just writing stuff down. She is super nice and caring. There is no way you will fail her class unless you really don't pay attention. She gives many opportunities for extra credit.,1
Took her for both CHM 090 and CHM 151 and she has been outstanding. She goes over the power points thoroughly and will stop for you to answer questions. and 99% of homework is optional so if you already understand the material you're free. She gives a study guide for all tests and final which are VERY useful and related! AWESOME TEACHER!,1
"Great guy.  He makes you work, but you learn a lot.",1
"She is a really great professor and person, a genuinely sweet woman who really cares about her students. Class is fairly easy, pay attention, ask questions, do the hw, easy A.",1
"He is not an easy professor, but he is very straight forward and willing to help. He may seem mean at first, but as long as he sees you trying and working hard he will do anything to help. His lab test are very straight forward and as long as you study you'll do well!",1
"Very awesome teacher! Had her for Engl 301 & 111. Very relaxed on grading, and is very concerned for you to retain the material. If you WANT to learn, you will learn. Otherwise, this class can be ""whatever""... Just turn in all your work and you will pass no problem. Probably, my funnest class yet!",1
GREAT class to take before going into Chem 141 and 143. Valeriy is sometimes hard to understand b/c of his accent. Sit in the front of the class. 4 tests total with a quiz everyday of class. Cant make up any quizzes. Become best friends with your peer leader as they are the ones who teach you all the information and will be w/ you for office hours,1
this class i thought would be interesting. but all ms. Bowlin did was read us the exam questions. and make sure we got the answers,1
"With the transition to online classes, he has been working very hard to make everything very organized and if he makes a mistake he is not afraid to give back points. He is a decent lecturer and provides quizzes with each online lecture to make sure you are on track. Class average is curved to a B which is fair considering the exam averages are low",1
"in office hours he refused to tell me which multiple choice questions I got wrong (after the exam): how is someone supposed to proactively improve their stratgies and weak areas, if they are not told which questions are wrong. What is the ppoint of picking up an exam that has no marks except for a total on the top. He doesnt even post an answer key",0
"I have noticed how unclear he is in the past when it comes to papers and such, but it has never mattered...until the final group paper in this class.  Make sure you get what he wants in the paper clarified before you even begin researching, otherwise it will cost you in the end even if he says you will get full credit as long as you do everything.",1
"We never had an essay assignment and there were extra credit opportunities. The tests were tough but as long as you payed attention during class you did fine. The textbook was used a lot, we had weekly readings but it wasn't ""mandatory"" even though she told we should read it. Overall I liked the class a lot, and definitely would  recommend it. ",1
He is by all means an easy A. He loves to joke around during class and not gonna lie I don't remember anything pertaining to Poli. econ. but I do remember that he was funny. Attendance is not mandatory. If this class doesn't directly relate to your major it can be a little boring. There's only a few assignments and the essays are finnesable.,1
he is worst teacher..,1
"Kathy is a wonderful professor, I would say one of the best here at CMU. All you need to do is attend class, which isn't a difficult thing to do as the lectures are really fun, interactive, and easy to sit through. She's really kind and will listen to student's opinions with no judgment. I would recommend her to anyone.",1
"(Part 1) Pros(1): He gives a sample exam to study and 90% of the questions on the actual exam comes from the sample exam   Cons(1): At least 20-30% of the answers you need to find for the questions in the sample exam are not easily obtainable. Pros(2): Rouhly speaking, 65-70% of the sample question answers can be found in the handouts he gives you",1
"This is not a regular history class. You will be acting like people from history so you must be prepared. Cool teacher, the class is unpredictable.",1
"Coming from a larger university, his teaching style was kind of a step back; not as challenging as university level math classes. He presented the material as it was straight out of the book and was always in his office to try to help you. tests were easy if you do the HW The final was HW probs and he even said what ones! Do the HW and you'll pass.",1
"He seems kind of funny when he makes jokes in class, but he's terrifying. He calls on you in class so pray he doesn't know your name. He doesn't give clear information about what is going to be on tests/quizzes. He expects you to know the lab manual by heart and doesn't go over the theory in them. He will grill you during lab presentations. BEWARE!",0
"New, but willing to learn.  Enthusiastic, and approachable.",1
This class is very difficult.The work never ends. We never get out of class early.Think twice about taking this.,0
"I had Mrs. Langille for API & loved her! She is a great teacher and very passionate about the subject. Enjoyed her labs and the guest speaker. AP is a tough subject so you have to be diligent, but I think she did a great job with the material and I've never been one to really excel at Science so hats off to her! I made an A in her class.",1
"Very sweet. Easy class, she makes it straight to the point and easy. Just review before test, you'll do good.",1
"Doesn't reply emails, doesn't want to help students, doesn't respect international students",0
Great teacher all around. Really enjoys teaching and helping others succeed.,1
He is a overall good lecturer. Take his class! You won't regret.,1
"Dr. DuBois is an excellent professor who goes to great lengths for her students to understand. She is patient and understanding when it comes to questions or doubts. However, her exams are difficult as they cover most of what she explained in her lectures as well as additional meticulous details that the book clarifies.Pay attention and take notes!",1
"I've taken several classes with Katey and liked every one. She connects material to life and clearly wants us to understand and do well. I think her lectures are interesting most of the time and she's pretty funny. Her tests can be tough sometimes, but if you go to class, pay attention, and study a bit, you'll be ok.",1
Very nice person but not the best professor. She goes way too fast and makes you feel dumb if you don't know an answer. She is willing to help but has an attitude which makes you not wanna ask at all!! Wouldn't recommend unless you're good in math!,1
"He has no tact. When questioning him, he gets very defensive and is ready to attack you left and right. Very unprofessional. Very obscure grader and mediocre at best.",0
"So I took Prof Garrisi about a year ago. She worked so hard on helping me do a semester abroad and wrote a great rec. for me. I just got back and can't wait to take her next level class. About half the class got an ""A"" except for the whiners and babies. She's so passionate about what she teaches. Crazy and funny.If you like Japanese, take her!",1
"Esposito is an awesome professor. He makes greek history engaging and even though it's expected that you read all the material, he breaks it down so well that if you miss a few days of reading you won't have trouble knowing what's going on. Highly recommend",1
I really liked her class . I could tell she likes to teach. She sends out weekly announcements. The course is straightforward with about 12 quizzes and 1 tests online and 4 discussion papers. There is only one project to do which a lot of work,1
"I dreaded going to her classes every week. She is very intimidating and demanding. The only good thing is attendance isn't being marked, but she will know if you skip class and calls you out on it. Readings were just long and boring academic articles. She seems to think she's better than she really is.",0
"3 short papers (2 pages) and 1 final paper (6 pages). Tries to relate Basque culture to our own culture, really makes it clear that he wants to have a reciprocative discussion where we are not just taking in information. Understands flaws in the education system, really sweet and kind.",1
"Matt Anderson is by far one of the most caring professors at NAU, he is so sweet. If you have him for a lab instructor, you are very lucky. He makes sure all of his students are understanding the material and gives out inspirational tips throughout the whole semester. Keep in mind since it is a lab, you have to go to class to get a good grade.",1
"1 Laura Ridenour a Quality of Teaching ai The worst teacher you will experience aii No quality in her teaching b Organization Skills i Nonexistent (she is supposed to be expert at organization?) c Communication Skills i. none, she is the worst",0
Overall a fantastic teacher and a fantastic guy. Would highly recommend.,1
"Absoultely hated this teacher. She does nothing for her students, all she talks about is her dog. She does not care if you pass or fail her class. She does not give any points for anything besides quizzes and tests. DO NOT take this teacher if you want to succeed.",0
Lots of work but you can revise and you actually learn to write! Good professor -he rocks1,1
A great class and friendly teacher. Attendance to both the yoga sessions and lectures are a must. You won't have to do the reading if you attend lectures.,1
"BEST PROFESSOR EVER PERIOD. His exams can be a little bit challenging but if you take good notes, ask him questions (which btw he is extremely patient and easy to talk to), and do the assigned hw you are going to do find in his class. He's kinda funny and a professional and fair educator. Take his class you wont regret it.",1
A great teacher that I would take for every class if I could,1
"Dr. Simms will make Geology very exciting. You will enjoy his lab projects, especially if you team up with motivated students, and you must be motivated. He does not follow the text book, and you must take notes when he is lecturing or you will do poorly on the exams. He is humorous and highly intelligent, and you will learn alot about our Earth.",1
"Glenn cares about his students, cares about their grades, cares about the material he teaches, and cares about the class. The class size was roughly 16- interesting daily class discussions and debates and easy quizzes on the reading. Never homework besides reading. Being good at speaking is not necessary to do well Coolest professor I've ever had",1
Mr Leonard is pretty cool. He is very reasonable on his grading scale. The work load in his class is definitely manageable. You have to go to the labs or you probably won't pass the class. He gives you a study guide and the answers so there is no reason to score less than a B on them! Good teacher!,1
"She's a great teacher and wants you to learn, but she does have favorites. We watched alot of movie but they were fairly relevant. Our grades consisted of a 2 4pg think papers, 1 in-class test with 2 take home essays, and 1 take home final. If you prove your points well- you'll get an A. We spent alot of time talking about Barack Obama as well.",1
"Favorite! Goes the extra mile for students. Builds a fun repor. Strict but fair. Tells exactly what he expects. Participation + attendance count. Lots of extra credit (ask about milkshake). Open-book online tests. Hard in-class quizzes. He gets nicer as semester goes on. Not everyone's cup of tea, but if you work hard, you'll appreciate each other.",1
"Dr. deBoyrie, is the best finance instructor you will ever encounter. I don't think it is possible learning from any other finance instructor. She is caring, compassionate, and patient. This instructor works very hard to help students learn and succeed, not only with finance but also in life.",1
"Excellent class.  Shartin is on top of his game, and if you allow yourself to get into the subject matter, you'll find your methods of thought changing.  Philosophy is difficult for some, but the professors at WSC make it much easier.  Shartin is no exception.  Take his classes.",1
easiest A ive ever had with absolutely 0 musical background or knowledge. went to one lecture and ended up with a 100 in the class. there are only 4-5 quizzes or tests which are the only assignments for the semester which come straight from the powerpoints and lectures he posts on canvas. the final was super super easy. TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!,1
Lets you write a cheat sheet and the exams were very similar to the practice exams. Taking this course with her online is a really hard to screw up.,1
"Great professor. As long as you attend his class and do the assignment, which don't take tale long, you'll get an A",1
"Doesn't have patience God would give a cat. Had to teach myself, very incorherent on what is going to be on the test.",0
"Steve is one of the best math professors I've had (and I've had a lot). He gets the difference between teaching/testing a concept and making it unnecessarily rigorous. He also teaches the use of a variety of technology (WolframAlpha, Mathematica, Ti-XX calculators, etc.). He's a funny dude, gives good lectures, and isn't out to fail you.",1
"Very interactive learning. Most classes are dedicated to explanation and demonstration of terms, attendance is mandatory. Very easy going with grades, she's more concerned that you're learning and understanding conflict resolution. She's a kind lady :)",1
Nice woman cares lots but makes no sense and impossible to follow. For a gender studies class she was a very closed minded.,0
"Nicholas Bahr is an excellent professor. My class was pretty small and he truly cared about his students. He let us choose between either exams or extra projects and the projects were very manageable. I had him for Brand Management and I learned a great deal in this class. For this class you could probably get by without the book, but I used it.",1
"Tom is a really caring and responsible professor. If you have a question, you should go to his office and he will be glad and he will help you to get a good grade. His class is not hard, you just need to go to class and take notes cuz he wont post them. Its quite easy to get a good grade if you keep in touch with him.",1
"Dr. Hoffman is hands down the best professor anyone could ever have. He made biochem an enjoyable course. He's sweet, funny, caring, somehow happy all the time, and highly knowledgeable and respected. The things I learned in his class have stuck with me through the semesters (which never happens). The grade earned comes only from an easy 4 exams.",1
"Alison is a force to be reckoned with.  She is the sole reason I am a success today.  Her course is very intense and time-consuming.   The goal of her class is, to make you as a student, ready for the intensity of NCCC's nursing program and I promise you, you'll thank her one day. She cares! So put on your big kid pants, and work for it:)",1
"Dr. Hill was by far the worst professor I had my freshman year. The most bland lecturer you'll ever see, she reads her notes and doesn't keep anyone in the room engaged. After five tests in her class, I still don't know how to prepare for one. If you're thinking about taking Nutrition as an elective -- DON'T. Dr. Hill makes an easy class hard.",0
"One of THE best professors ever! His classes are basically 99% lecture but don't worry, you'll be interested 100% of the time. He knows his stuff, and lectures in a funny and engaging way that makes the time go by quickly. Very few assignments, pay attention and you'll pass.",1
"Serpell is a kind and thoughtful mentor. She welcomes student input to her classes, and she's really responsive and helpful in office hours. I really loved taking classes with her because I feel like she really values our ideas. Would recommend; it's a not an easy A, but totally accessible if you are willing to do the work!",1
He goes over the course too fast. He went over a semester worth of course within 2 months. All he did was review for the last month. so bascially skip class? you will not pass or you can just by hitting the books forever. ,0
Dr. Stovall is one of the MOST understanding prof I've had here. He knows what it was like to be a student and he empathizes with the stress level we have and he makes it clear that the last thing he wants to do is make our lives more stressful. I've learned the most from his class. His experiences teach us just as much as the book does.,1
Your entire grade is based off of 3 exams that he does not prepare you well for at all. He offers homework that can help improve your exam scores but the homework takes between 1-3 hours to complete sometimes longer.,0
"I avoid Misurda at every chance I get, you will not find me willingly taking his class. All his lectures are monotoned, without use of examples or direction. Projects are extremely hard, no structure to the course and lack of examples in class. TA's are more helpful at explaining concepts then the teacher. No piazza even tho class is online.",0
He was a great Prof. he was interesting and a bit of a goofball at times. There were alot of notes but we could use the book for things. I loved his class!,1
Very knowledgeable. Very difficult grader for a first year class. Don't take if you like your GPA.,1
One of best classes I've taken! Makes you work to help you understand. Activities are fun and exams or not bad if you study! Helps in any way he can! TAKE HIM!!!,1
The most sweetest English teacher ever. Gives the best lectures and she's hilarious. If you fail that class it's because you don't want to do anything. She gives snacks every class. I took her for Enc1101 Tuesdays and Thursdays but she only said to come Thursdays. We only did 5 essays which you only turn in 3 and just do Mylabplus .,1
"Great Instructor. Passionate and has a lot of fun stories to teach the material. The Class is an easy A you just need to read and keep up on the material. Take her, she is kind and very interesting",1
She gave good lecture and was easy to ask questions. This class is one of the hardest at Pierce. This semester was tough online and knowing that she still wouldnt round anyones grade who had a 79 or 89. The mental stress from this class is exhausting and having so many assignments doesnt help you study. She only gave us 4 days to study for final,0
Great professor...not the most exciting class due to material. Got an A by going to class and taking notes bc he tests on a lot of what he says/draws. He uses a clicker system but not often. Tests on concepts and not memorization. Drops your lowest test. Textbook is not necessary. Little curve (2%) so don't depend on it. Not a bad class!,1
best class at UNO,1
"Great professor. Very knowledgeable, but sometimes too knowledgeable that his explanation could make you even more confused.",1
Calculus II is a very hard class as it is and he makes it harder when he doesn't completely finishes examples and doesn't go over complicated examples which are seen in the very long hw. Quizes are very short which make it hard to get pts. He's smart but he needs to realize this is our first time taking the course and we need more thorough lectures,0
Very unclear and unorganized. Couldn't understand what he was saying half the time. When you ask for help his explanations were even more confusing than the problem.  He is a smart man but doesn't know how to teach. AVOID at all costs if you need to move to a higher chemistry class. ,0
"Lots of homework. Curves heavily. Didn't finish parts 2a, 2b, 3a, and 3b of the project and bombed the midterm and final leaving me with a 62% but I still snuck in with a C. Would def take again",1
really a very enthusiastic prof. Made class really interesting,1
"Such an easy class!!! Wow, if you take this professor, you definitely won't regret it. No homework, you can find the answers online for the 3 quizzes he gives, and that's pretty much it! No midterm or final, only 1 group assignment which is easy too. You can sign the attendance and just leave later class. Definitely a good pick not gonna lie.",1
"Lectures consist of ""learning"" terms and specific pieces which are just the quiz answers. No in depth understanding or outside example. Koehler rambles incoherently every single lecture as others have noted. Talks for mere minutes at a time about the class subject, elsewhere rants about unrelated and milquetoast conspiracies about society.",0
"She used to teach in Elementary school, and she runs her college class that way. She definitely cares for her student, but more in the ""overbearing mother"" kind of way. You might have to swallow your pride in order to pass.",0
Jon is just a grad student but he teaches some calc classes. He really makes sure you understand everything and does a good job explaining all of the material. He's a cool guy too.,1
She is the most amazing prof. I've had while I've been at North Greenville!!!,1
"She is always on Facebook when I come to ask her a question. She really doesn't spend a bit of time with you trying to explain something, she jumps all over the place. After taking the exam both writing and test don't expect to receive it when she says she will. I recommend taking someone different at the Pensacola campus.",0
"She is the best.  Had her for a few classes, she has the most professional demeanor  while being super supportive at the same time.  She explains things very clearly, and if you still don't understand, she is always willing to work with you to make sure you get an explanation that works for you.  Honestly, could not ask for a better teacher.",1
"Never met a more lazy professor, this guy never taught us a single thing only posted videos and never did anything himself. Lazy, unhelpful and unreachable, I have never hated another person so much in my entire life. This prof is extremely lazy, DO NOT TAKE UNLESS YOU HAVE TO. I would have given him a 0 if it was possible.",0
He is an excellent teacher and a genuinely good person.  I enjoyed his class and learned a lot about writing.  I recommend him to everyone!,1
If he was cutting it short on time in class due to the amount of material needed he would make mistakes but they would be him forgetting a negative sign or something small like that would cause an issue but not have an issue in the formula used.,1
Notes are unclear as well as her lectures are pointless. Avoid.,0
Best Prof Millersville has!  So willing to help with constructive criticism.,1
"If you are looking to get out of your comfort zone and work for your grades, take her class. She sets high standards for her students and will call names out if nobody is participating. Follow her guidelines I would suggest going above and beyond to meet with her. She is never on time with anything, but her classes are genuinely interesting.",0
"She does not teach well. If you can not learn on your own, do not take this class. Also, she is not good at helping when you need it.",0
Her English and grammar very poor and she is hard to understand. She should really take some English classes.,0
One of the best professor in University at Albany,1
Professor Reese is the type of professor that each teacher should strive to be like. He is ultimately the best teacher I have had while being in college. He totally understands the material that needs more attention and focuses on the criteria that is necessary. He is very understanding and always communicates well when there is a problem at hand.,1
"She was always very vague about what she wanted. She expected you to use canvas a lot and from what I could remember would never give you a heads up with something was coming up, I understand that it's our responsibility, but Eng101 is one of the 1st classes you take in college and I didn't know how to use it right away. A heads up would've been n",0
No Comments,1
he is a generous man but is opinionated and has a bit of an attitude at times. gives social work majors a hard time...24/7,1
"Awesome teacher.  She is super nice and sweet and explains everything very thoroughly.  You do not need the textbook because she has a Prezzi made for everything she goes over and they are posted online.  Her tests are hard, but if you actually study important things from that unit you will get a good grade.  A couple pop quizzes but that's it.",1
i highly recommend this professor. she is such a generous teacher in grading. she always motivate to join you the debate team. i love her!,1
"Out of all my classes I have taken overall, this has been the most disappointing. The overall course setup is very unclear and the lack of explanation on assignments leaves you guessing on what needs to be done. Every test period she was absent from, and the syllabus was changed 5 times and still the final two weeks of class were left ""TBD"".",0
Professor Weidner is very informed on the topic and the material presented. The class was excellent to build a good base knowledge with many projects (weekly) as well as discussions. Reading the instructions the project should not be much of an issue but grading is a little slow. A good class and you will learn a lot about an up and coming field.,1
"He is the most boring person on earth. has no clue who's presentation is on what days.. its a bit amusing. can't understand a word he says. it's a ""teach yourself"" class. if you can do that.. then you can get an A. ..i did it.",1
When he teaches he just stands there and reads off the powerpoint. doesnt do many examples to actually teach you the material. No extra credit. Does not care if most of the class if failing and does not do much to help. Would not take again and would not recommend. Tests are majority of grade (75 percent of your grade including final).,0
This rating has been removed as per our site guidelines.,1
Hands down the best professor I have ever had. He is so understanding and easy grader. I love that he talks about his life stories because you are able to relate it to the chapter. Highly reccomend and he is such a role model to so many. Anyone I talk to has never said one negative thing.,1
"BA 340 was very enjoyable with  David. He's very funny and makes marketing interesting. The class is primarily group discussion, but he does not force you to speak in class; so don't let that sway you from taking his class. There are two/three Moodle assignments online every week. No tests, and the final project is a group presentation.",1
"She is great at giving feedback and actually helping you do well in the class. There's not too many assignments, just some larger discussions and goals for finishing parts of the research term paper. The class was interesting, but the book was pretty boring. Overall it was a good class.",1
"He doesn't provide feedback on the quizzes/test, so if you get something wrong, which you most likely will with how strict of a grader he is, it feels extremely bad. All he does for lectures are homework problems and he offers no real guidance for students. If you want an A, it'll be really difficult depending on your own math skills.",0
"He doesn't really teach anything. He likes to give his political opinion as factual information. He's a great guy but he will tell straight up lies and have you write it down as fact. If you genuinely care about preserving History accurately, do not take his class. I regret it.",1
Very very vague assignment instructions. I had no idea what I was doing the entire time in this course. It was mandatory for me but his classes are not mandatory don't take them! He is also really quiet and zones out a lot. He does not explain anything in class or on paper.,0
Dana is a great ASL teacher. Many students are hesitant when they find out they will have a deaf instructor but she is very patient and easy to understand. As long as you do all of your workbook assignments (which take 20 mins typically) you will do very well in the class. Love it!,1
Took the class about 3 years ago and had to take it 3x.  It was very difficult but Mr Crittenden was extremely helpful and I still appreciate it and hold him in very high regards.  He is by far one of the best teachers GCC has to offer.  Anyone would be lucky to have him as a teacher.,1
"Good guy. Very helpful. Moved a bit slow, but made sure everyone understood everything about the material. This class is not as scary as everyone thinks.",1
"Really just an amazing professor and person. You watch a lot of documentaries on music and learn all about music history in a way that's really interesting. There are a few quizzes, a midterm, and a final. HOWEVER, he does all he can to prepare you for these. He's connected in the music world, and can help with internships and advice.. MUST take!",1
"There's a lot of work to do in this class, but you'll be fine if you keep up with the work and the deadlines. The guy talks a lot but overall, chill professor.",1
"bias n unfair are the right words! this guy barely teaches..his class is like watching a bad skit of a comedian that already sucks. all he does is make jokes n doesnt teach class..on the positive side, you always get out of class early so depending on what type of student u r u might like him, but if u wanna learn n wanna have a fair grade, AVOID!",0
"Definitely, do the packets he hands out even though they are ""optional"". Most of the questions are on the tests. Also, no word banks so learn your definitions. STUDY FOR TESTS.",1
"The red flag not to take: he wrote the textbook, refers to himself in it many times This course is doable, just a lot of hoops to go through for a 200-level psych course (if it was listed 400 level - ok). The caucasity really shows when he calls tai chi a ""slow motion exercise"" but Wikipedia lists it as martial arts. Sends pass agg emails.",0
"She is a great professor, but assignments take a lot of time. Lots of writing for each discussion bored and expects citations and APA format for everything! Test arent easy. There is a review for each test but on the test they have short answers that are each difficult. Her signature assignment is even more annoying and hard.",1
"Kind of strange, but a really cool dude once you get used to his Canadianism. Only complaint would be that his notes on the board end up being pretty disorganized which makes it a little difficult to study. Oh also the fact that it was an 8am class sucked. A lot of people didn't show up or do the readings but all of that is important. Dorky cute.",1
So easy loved her,1
"By far the best teacher I've ever had. You won't see her in a bad mood, she is respectful with everyone, and the most important: an awesome teacher!",1
"This class is very interesting but her methods of grading are horrendous. She gives you the questions she will ask on the midterm and goes over the answers in lecture, but even when writing all that out and more from the textbook she says it's ""too vague"". She is very hard to talk to about how to improve, and lectures are VERY disorganized.",0
"Phil is a good teacher. He is funny and has a lot of knowledge about agriculture. He can come off as a little snobby. Overall a good lecturer. Easy class, however, there is a 5-page research paper, but he grades super easy.",1
"Dr. Bates is a great teacher and shows great interest in her job and research area. She is very easy to talk to, entertaining during classes, and gives a fair work load. Attendance is not taking for her intro classes, however as she likes to give pop quizzes it's risky to miss a class. I enjoyed the class and would take another class with her.",1
"His class was fun! Loved drawing different things for his class. However only gives you 2 absences, if you go passed 2, he'll mark you down 10% off your final. So that's where the extra credit comes in to make up for absences",1
wow honestly I thought this professor was the most passionate professor who enjoys what he does! He is SO GOOD with explaining! He loves answering questions! I was so terrified of  this class but he made it so easy. There was not a single time that I was bored in this class. I RECCOMEND!,1
"Dr. Cooper is a new and young professor. He is normally a physics guy so he probably wasn't too happy to have to teach calc. There are two 20 point tests with 6 questions each. 2 easy, 2 medium, 2 hard (usually). If you worked hard in calc in HS you should be fine. I did no work and got a B. Big curve bc of low averages and extra credit at the end.",1
"Because I had him for World Lit 1 there obviously was a lot of reading, but he made it bearable. He gave good information and introductions for the units and selections, helping me understand the material. The reading analysis assignments were time consuming but were essential to gaining insight to the readings. Wish I had him for World Lit II.",1
"Chandra is the worst professor I have ever had at umb. Physics is a difficult subject to begin with and 90% of the class are not physics majors yet his expectations for us are ridiculously high. 2 midterm and a final, midterms consist of 2 questions, so if you get one question wrong you fail. Endless amounts of homework not even related to lecture.",0
Awesome first year class. Hope to have her again in the future.,1
"I've taken 2 online courses with this professor so far, and it feels like a burden has been lifted off my shoulders, and in addition, I learn so much more than what I already know or more. No joke, no BS, just do what he assigns, even if it's alittle late and you'll pass with flying colors.",1
Great at explaining complex ideas one step at a time so they are easy to understand! Also very helpful in labs. Beware the final exam is quite long and difficult but for some reason you only get 2 hours for it.,1
"Ignore the negative posts! This instructor is a MUST ! The class is easy to navigate, offers repeatable homework + tons of bonus points (up to 2.5% onto final grade). She posts all of the questions + answers to the final exam and the average of the midterm + final replaces a low midterm score. If you can't pass this class, you did't try!",1
"Dr. Crawley is one of the first professors I've had here at Marywood. He is kind, understanding and you can tell he really loves his job. He is the head of my department and whenever I have questions or concerns he answers very quickly. His class is tough but he helps you through. I'm disappointed I won't have him again before graduation.",1
good prof,1
Dr. Piland basically makes you read the entire book yourself and then fills in some blanks with his lectures. You will to put a lot of time into studying for this class.,1
"Mary Layoun is a very nice person. Its nice that participation is 30% of grade but lectures are just painful. She will talk about ""trying to get people to talk about difficult topics"", then turn around and make offensive asides in lecture. TA's grade your 3 papers, and they are really strict. If you're not a lit major, then I wouldn't recommend. ",0
"The most condescending prof I've had at Carleton. Does not answer questions well and when you ask for clarification he seems as though he is annoyed with you and does not expand on his previous answer. Pray you have a decent TA for this class. I didn't find the course hard, however that doesn't excuse the profs lack of interest in helping students.",0
First of all i definitely could have gotten an A or B+ in this course but grading criteria is so awful and unclear made me get a C+. This instructor is always unclear about what are we doing in the labs and doesn't explain stuff well. If you got a bad group than you are probably gonna have bad grade in the final project. Lectures are boring.,0
he is a great man he really force you to think. from his teaching style every student could understand what he was  trying to teach. he have  a good communication skills between students. he is the best teacher i ever saw. you must choose him  as your professor. i wish i become his student one more time.,1
Went for one reason and left with a new understanding,1
"A LOT of hw and classwork, test was open note and project was over the course of a couple of months. If you can keep up for the first month the rest of the class will be a breeze. However, Morris is perhaps one of the most vanilla boring lecturers I've had. Bring earbuds to class.",0
"The only one, that understands sustainability as a system.",1
"BEST PSYCH PROF AT PACE- knows his stuff, fair grader. wants you to get an A. goes out of his way to make sure you understand the material.",1
My only complaint is that Kubota works through new grammar points very quickly. Lots of homework and sometimes it is hard to keep up in the M-F class.,1
"Don't expect any of your papers graded and have feedback provided; It takes her about 2 weeks to grade things and by that time you'll of already had another 3 essays due. Its absolutely frustrating, on a regular assignment you'll be waiting to get you're grades back for about 5 other things. Avoid if possible.",0
"Not hard but challenging. likes students to work in teams and make decisions oruselves. likes the students who speak up even if they argue with him. he helps if you ask. even comes in on weekends for students who want to work on projects. good guy, but don't mistake him for easy. he is fair and reasonable, but expects you to try to solve problems.",1
"dr workman is a passionate professor who cares about your understanding and application of theory. when he is at his best, he will give you great feedback on your papers and presentations. listens to you outside of class. a very real dude. also funny",1
"Definitely not a professor that I would recommend. She is not very nice, and is extremely unorganized. Everything is online, even the book. She does not respond to emails often, and when she does she is very passive aggressive. She should not be a professor. I have not learned a thing from her class.",0
"Took MET205 with her a while back, she was always very clear in her lectures and her grading was always fair (she also got grades in pretty fast, which was nice). Sometimes the lectures were a little slow-paced, which made it hard to stay focused in the mornings, but otherwise she was a pretty good professor. :)",1
"love love love Labelle. Amazing professor. Lectures are inspirational and actually teach. Exams are straight forward, and study guides are provided. Will offer feedback on assignments. REALLY understands her subject research. Very smart professor and love attending her class. Definitely will take her in the future. ",1
"very vague lectures, always behind from the syllabus, a lot of not productive group discussions in tables with singular questions that we then have no time left to share thoughts with the class.",0
"Poor professor. Spent the whole semester coming to class and having him ramble for 40 out of the 50 minutes, then try to cram some incomprehensible analysis of whichever book we were currently reading into the last few minutes. Semester project was basically busywork with no guidance, and he refused to give a clear answer, even during office hours.",0
Jane's great. She really loves what she teaches. Lectures are almost exactly like reading the chapter so you could either go to class or read. Her review sessions are very helpful.,1
"Cool, laid back guy. Just lectures from a slideshow, emails you the slides after class. Gives two tests, which are super easy. Def take if you're not the best science.",1
"Lectures are tedious and seem completely unnecessary, yet are the main focus of the class for some reason. The lab is fine, but instructions are often unclear and I found myself coming in outside of class far more often than any other I've had. It is hard to understand him at times and this makes communication a struggle.",0
If you dont want to learn anything but want to get A then take her class.Practice exam samples well.,1
"Don't understand how he can be rated below a 5 for easiness. A 75% is an A, and I got a 95 doing minim work. Just go to class and sleep and hit 2 clicker buttons and you'll get an A",1
Great teacher,1
"Only use one of two textbooks, attendance is mandatory but participation is not; editing days for essays are also mandatory for credit so have the work done; days that are only for working on the essay before it is due are sometimes not mandatory and can be skipped. If the class is going good sometimes food is brought in.",1
The most amazing professor you will ever take. She is the most helpful & nicest professor. Her lectures are clear. She even has online office hours before tests for any last minute questions and offers a lot of extra credit. Tests are half written half multiple choice but during class she hints at what exactly you need to know. DEFINITELY TAKE!!,1
"This professor knows the material, and is average at teaching it. If you are not in class, than you won't do too well. I had to miss a few days because I broke my wrist, which made the class way more difficult, and she still graded me tough. Lots of papers on subjects  I personally didn't enjoy. ",1
Dr. Curtis is extremely enthusiastic about the course material. She is also very willing to work with you IF you show initiative. She is overall a great woman who will change your view on a lot of things. Take her class!,1
He is a really good teacher. He cares about each student and makes sure each student understand what was taught. We were lucky to have him as our teacher.,1
LOVE Dr. Marlow! His personality is definitely out there and made me nervous at first cause he is so hyper and full of energy. 4 major papers. If you go to his office hours he is TREMENDOUS help! Should have done it all year. He is funny and will deff keep you laughing.  I am for sure taking him for any future english class that i can GREAT teacher,1
"I don't know if online isn't his thing, but he really dropped the ball this semester. Everything from lectures to hw resources posted late enough to not be useful, or not at all. On top of that he doesn't let you show work on exams. Makes our lives harder to make his easy. Avoid.",0
Susott is a great professor. You can tell that he is really passionate about history and wants his students to pass. There are three papers assigned in this class but they are not difficult if you put In the effort.  Don't forget to take the online quizzes he assigns every other week. I definitely recommend him for  this class.,1
"Hes pretty funny and a cool guy, but if you are not very well educated on these topics and dont want to allocate a fair amount of time towards this course then I wouldnt recommend this class for you. If you love economics you will be fine, but if it is hard for you, do yourself a favor and take an easier professor",1
"Bill Hassey is the Best professor at WSBE I don't know what kind of weirdo gave him bad rating on here because Bill is the man. Super respectful, interesting, and great teacher. Has realistic expectations and is a VERY VERY fair grader. I can't say enough good things about him, just take his class dammit!!!",1
Very cool and nice person!!! She's very caring and wants you to do well. She's a great math teacher and does not judge when you don't know something you should know. She doesn't care if you are on your phone during class either.,1
Prof. Felber is awesome! Her feedback is really helpful.,1
"Professor Myers is the best math teacher I have ever had in my life. She makes time to help everyone in class individually, and she is personally invested in your success. She doesn't let you give up, she will work on a problem with you until you figure it out, and she gets super excited when you get it. Take her for any math class that you can!",1
"This is a really interesting class if you are interested in the material. Jamie is VERY knowledgeable and wants to help you do well. There is no reason not to do well, extra credit opportunities, etc. If you are interested in how animals learn and training techniques this is an excellent class. All assignments are interesting.",1
"Nice guy and very willing to help you understand but for me, clarity in lectures could be way better. I had to learn everything from the book rather than from him.",1
Nice guy.  Extremely helpful.,1
One of the major reasons I have succeeded at UW is because Dr. Xing took me under her wing after a complicated administration type of issue left me a bit stranded. I approached her early on and she has been straight forward and guiding since the day I got to her class. This class is experimental but a big must for quality theory in practice.,1
"Awesome teacher, awesome guy",1
"Makes class fun, but doesn't really help that much. Overall I liked her.",1
Best class I've taken. She was very kind. I really learned a lot. She really helped you understand the material w/ in-depth and interesting lectures. New grading system was VERY different from standard grading which I think is what scared people. It really was not that hard to understand and she was willing to explain the syllabus like 30 times.,1
"She is one of the most important scholar / thinker alive today, it is an honor to learn from her. She is an amazing teacher and someone who can teach you endlessly about yourself and the world.",1
"Mrs. Fox is tough, but diamonds are the hardest rock, and this one's a real gem. Stick it out and work your ass off and you'll learn so much.",1
WOW HARD HARD HARD CLASS nice instructor though and you'll deffantly laugh in his class love Mr.K but hate the class lol,1
One of the best professors I've had. Quite understanding when it comes to assignment . Have to experience this professor for yourself. Don't listen to other students that spread false rumors about him. Once you enter the classroom you'll realize that those individuals were the problem. He provides additional teaching aids to students.,1
"She didnt teach. No lectures, PowerPoints, & rarely communicated and this is an online class. All the assignments were on Connect & you basically had to teach yourself & read the text to learn. The midterm & final were proctored & you arent able to use any notes, the textbook, or search engines unlike the hw. Avoid her if you can, hard for GenEd.",0
She is a great professor who seems to enjoy what she is teaching and makes online class/ lectures somewhat entertaining.,1
WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!,0
DON'T TAKE ALYCE HUNTER. She has made it clear that she doesn't care about anyone's situation during this pandemic. Shes a tough grader - no one gets full credit she always takes off one point for spelling/grammar but can't even spell check herself. Group work is mandatory in this ONLINE CLASS. ALWAYS emails back late & super vague/condescending,0
"I had him for 3 classes- 135, 136, & 137. As long as you do the work and participate a bit, you'll get a good grade. He gives a lot of leeway because he considers writer to be ""artists."" Inspiring and knows his craft. One of the coolest teachers I had at Palomar.",1
"Professor Stein is a solid choice for ENG110. I don't consider myself a great writer, but if you put the effort in, you'll get the grade you want. She isn't lecture heavy and instead uses class time to peer edit essays. Don't hand in an essay on time, no problem because she understand that this is just one of many classes you take.",1
"He asked us for our opinion and I rarely do evaluations. However, I felt compelled to do one for Professor Hercules-Menjivar. He is by far one of the best professors I've had in my three years at NJIT. The class moves a bit fast, but he never leaves you behind (unless you don't ask questions). He tries to make the best of every lecture.",1
Very nice person. Easy class. The only homework she gives is two short papers. Didn't even need the book. Got an A.,1
she is so nice.  She would meet with me on extra days in the week to help with my papers. she tells you exactly what to do to get a good grade in her class.  I got an A.  :),1
"Professor D is the man! Would definitely take him again. He will make you work for your grade but it's well worth it, I'm Blackfoot Native American on my moms side and I knew a lot about it but he really taught me a lot. Very thankful for that information. So glad I took his class, def take it! You might learn a lot bout your ancestors to.",1
Professor Gray loves what she does but in my opinion she is not the best professor even though a lot of people love her.  She just lectures and has power points that have endless slides.  She often rambles and gets off topic and her tests are extremely hard.  The tests never have anything she taught in class.  Try to avoid her for this class.,0
DON'T TAKE HERE SHE WILL GIVE YOU A F FOR EVERYTHING DON'T HELP YOU AT ALL DON'T TAKE HER RUN NOW,0
The best!,1
"Trzynadlowski is not that bad. He is a cool guy and always help students. He is hard to understand sometimes but if you can't hear him just move to the front. His tests are easy if you study the material. However, his grading is a bit hard.",1
"Professor Stevenson is amazing. She really cares about you and your willingness to succeed. If you want to get a good grade, she will do everything she can to help you succeed. By far one of the best anatomy teachers there is. I had her for 211 lab and plan on taking her for 212 lab too!",1
Wonderful.  Friendly and very brilliant.He explains things well. He CARES about his students!!,1
"He is definitely a geek and really does care for his students. But he can get a little too weird at some points. I would say he is a pretty tough grader, especially for a basic English class. You have four major essays throughout the class so you would want to focus on this. He only allows for three absences before he can kick you from the class.",1
"What I liked about Professor Mayne is that she consistently provided feedback, and applied her knowledge and wisdom to her perspective on the case studies and analysis of basic employment law. It is necessary to read in order to understand the course thoroughly. Her organization and guidance made the course successful.",1
I feel like he would make a better tutor than a teacher. He's really good with one on one help.,1
No Comments,0
"Assignments due every Sunday. The ppts were posted from the beginning to take notes and the textbook had so many resources to help practice. He was quick to respond to emails, sent many reminders, and helped me out a lot esp during covid-19. He's amazing & wants the best for every student and as long as you study you will get the grade you deserve.",1
Mrs . Hayden was a great teacher.. All you have to do is show up do the work and pass. She does games to help students pass their test .She is even nice enough to give you a cellphone number and you can email her. She respond quickly. She is also understanding of any family emergencies. I would definitely recommend this class.,1
"Somewhat easy English 101 class.  Very sweet lady, very flexible, and willing to help you outside of class.  Lots of time to work on papers and not super difficult.  What hurt my grade was participation so make sure you do the correction/review paper WS.  Greet choice and genuinely wants to teach students and help them to become better writers.",1
"Dotts is an okay teacher. I emailed him once and he responded rudely, other than that he was an excellent teacher. I most likely would not take this class again because it is lecture heavy and sometimes could be really boring.",1
"Her lectures are clear with slides on blackboard with fill in the blank, so show up to class everyday. She has detailed study guides and if you can fill them out then you will get A's on her tests. She gives out limited extra credit but with plenty of opportunities to gain those points. I have taken other classes with her and she is very helpful. ",1
"Mr. Morris has forgotten more about Creo than you'll ever learn. He's the perfect instructor for a class like ME359 which isn't really based on theory. The homeworks are graded harshly, so be sure that everything in your drawing is *exactly* how it looks in the example.",1
" The music industry is a dynamic business, and Professor Young accounts for industry news by assigning graded discussion questions throughout the semester. This class is by no means easy, so do not take it looking for an easy A. Professor Young expertly combines inside knowledge with academia to create a comprehensive course.",1
No extra credit,1
"Her and her husband teach this class together, which is a cool perspective because they have a lot of differing opinions so it leads to a lot of debates! My main problem is that the amount of reading expected was insane- easily 100 pages a week, sometimes more. Expected too much work for a 4 credit, intro history class.",1
"Beware she will test you on information that she does not cover, nor say to read in text book. Also you can write what you think is the right answer, but she will mark it wrong. When you ask her for anything she is not approachable, and is arrogant and rude. She puts students down in and out of class, and shouldnt be a professor period.",0
"Offered upwards of 6% Ex Cr. 7 Homeworks 23%. 4 Exams (65%) Most curved. Easy class as far as getting the points, he gives you huge study guides for the tests. The bad part is even if you're interested in Astronomy he's so monotone and non-interactive with the class that most people are falling asleep. Really unfortunate if you like this stuff.",1
"She's a really chill prof, and she leads interesting discussions. The works she picks to read are well-rounded and interesting. Work really hard on the two take-home essays and use her office hours. She really prepares you for the in-class essays, so don't miss class leading up to test days. Readings are due in every class as well as journals.",1
The professor was okayish. He is not a harsh grader or rude. The only problem with this course is how he gives out the projects. The projects are difficult to understand and very hard to accomplish. He talks a long time giving feedback to people who need papers to get signed.,1
Scott is my favourite teacher from Seneca. You can tell he has fun teaching his class and is very respectful of his students. All he wants is for students to attend class and to participate. He ensures that his classes are safe environments and helps students get out of their shells. As long as you show you're making the effort you will pass.,1
"Definitely one of the nicest professors. I had him for FYS so we spent a lot of time discussing the book we read and watching Pixar movies (score!) I would definitely take this class again, it wasn't super difficult and he is a really laid back guy who knows what he is talking about. Class discussions were best. AND he is Canadian :)",1
"She is the worst professor i had in my life the worst in UBC so far. Unorganized the explanations are totally unclear. The grading criteria and feedback on midterms is confuse as hell. The tests are not abou the lecture. My course is Algae, fungi and bryophites the finals were about Corey Bradshaw's presentation that, and about the whole eukaryote",0
"He has three projects that you work on all semester to turn in at the end. He doesn't grade anything until the very end so you don't know how you are doing in the class. I thought it was a pretty straight forward class, but I came out with a much lower grade than expected in the end so don't be hopeful. Getting an A will be nearly impossible.",0
"If you take one of his classes be prepared for class you will be called upon to answer questions.  You will be embarrassed in front of the class. Be prepared to provide supporting data for answers.  There is alot of discussion as part of this course, but I did not find it to be a supportive environment.",0
"Very helpful, and gives out CANDY!",1
Not clear on grading and basically impossible to get an A. You can follow feedback after feedback and never be given higher than a B unless she likes you. For our final project she didn't have any feedback and nobody got more than a low A no matter what. Seems impossible to please.,0
Loved her. Wonderful professor. Easy to get along with.,1
He called the feedback insulting in class but he needs to listen to what we are saying. This format is not working for most people. He needs to change his grading scale & curve. Not a bell curve just a normal curve that all other teachers do. My last chem teacher added 5% to each test but he waited to announce it until the final. He should do that.,0
"He is an amazing Professor, I wish others would be as good as him. He is very thorough and very knowledgeable. He makes sure you understand and are clear on the subject. By far the best professor/teacher I have ever had. You will know math when you complete the class.",1
"Incredible professor. Really helpful for the exams, gives extra review before the test. Really funny. Good at explaining material.",1
"Participation is important. Reading assignments given for in class discussion and lectures. Easy group in class assignments, but you can also complete on your own for credit if class is missed. ",1
"I highly recommend professor Carr , if you want to actually learn and earn your grade.",1
"professor Ferreira is an amazing teacher! She has fantastic enthusiasm and energy. The person below me mentioned she taught us how to write a thesis introduction etc etc. She even goes over with handouts and as part of a lecture how to properly use commas which was great especially if you really payed attention and or kept handout, do rough drafts!",1
"NOTE: I took this class online during COVID-19. You don't need to attend the live class sessions, though you may want to skim them. I wouldn't say that she is a tough grader, but you need to fully answer every question. The textbook is straight-forward, so I skimmed it. The final was okay. I'd recommend having complete answers to the 6 outcomes.",1
"Dr. Clementz is a great professor and each lecture he is engaging and understandable. The grades are 5 exams, including the final, and the material is straight out of the textbook. Make sure you study the textbook chapters thoroughly. My experience may have been easier bc of open-note during COVID. Class undemanding online, maybe harder in person.",1
"Pickiest man on the planet for sure & you'll find out why. Material & tests aren't too difficult but you will have to teach yourself some stuff cause his lectures only help for about 30% of the homework he gives. Lectures feel long and boring. At the end of the day this class is not even that hard, just TIME CONSUMING and PICKY, read the syllabus!!",1
"He knows how to keep it real, doesn't lecture on and on about stuff you'll never need to know. He's experienced but doesn't treat you like a child like some other instructors can. He's funny and will help you do well to the best of his ability.",1
"He is an awesome teacher! I absolutley would recommend him to ANYONE! He keeps you interested, helps you whenever you would like, and over all is a great guy. if you have the oppurtunity to take him, please do.",1
"Everything is very clear and if you participate Dr. Lane is not rude to you. If you are lazy or don't want to think, he will challenge you.",1
"If you take his course, don't stand out.  He will grade you based on your visual appearance, class, etc. He spends most of his time on personal business and cancels class a lot. He thoroughly answers questions, but with a patronizing attitude.  He'd be a great guy if he wasn't so insecure and full of himself. Talks about fellow staff negatively. :(",0
All around nice guy with a clear passion for the material and the willingness to work with you to maximize your educational experience,1
"You definitely need the textbook in this class and also come to class because he talks about everything you read in the book. He's an easy grader. This class is an easy A, as long as you do the online homework which is read a chapter of a textbook and makeup and answer 3 questions. He's very nice but he just very strict on all electronic devices.",1
"Dr. Corrigan is one of the greatest professors I've had at Emory. He's absolutely brilliant and cares about his students. He grades leniently, but the feedback is good. He tells you what you could've improved without taking points off. Lectures are incredible. You don't want to miss them.",1
"Dr. record is a really good prof. He listens to the students concerns and helps a lot. I would love to have him again. Be prepared to do projects without a ton of guidance. You are welcome to ask questions, but also be independent.",1
good teacher. will help,1
"Great Teacher! He is very understandable, Comprehendable, and is always there to listen to any questions you may have or help with any probles. he makes class fun and interesting and clear in his lectures. Not dont think you can go to his class and pass without studing because this is not the case. He is very challanging.Top pick for finance classe",1
She is a fantastic teacher and it is very evident that she cares about students success and loves the field she works in. The group projects are easy A's. There is a review before every exam that earns you extra credit on the exam. Shes provides a study guide for every exam. She also looks like Pam from the Office. Good for non science majors.,1
She is not an easy grader. Her test ask random questions about half in her powerpoints half from the book. The amount of Studying I needed to do to get an A was the most I have ever needed to study. Others will study for hours and only get a C on the exams. She is not the professor just be prepared for the class I guess.,0
"He's a good professor, be ready to learn. If you don't know java, then you didn't pay attention in the 3 other classes, so that your problem. If you don't cheat and put in the effort you will learn a lot in this class. He knows what he's talking about, and can answer any of your questions. +1 for python, but CSULA teaches only java which sucks",1
"i came to improve my speaking skills, I not only found new information, but tricks of the trade to improve my focus, I am always nervous. Matt helped me improve my skill set and that is why i took this class, when you get what you came for the professor gets an A",1
"Excellent professor!  Very helpful especially with such a difficult course on-line.  There should be more professors like him at La Verne!  You can tell that Mr. Nelson puts effort into both his students and his work. Very, very helpful!! And this was an on-line course, can you imagine if he were teaching on-campus!? He'd be excellent!!!",1
"I spent so many HOURS a week on this class and am doing fine in lab but legit am scared that I'm going to fail and have to repeat the course. Tests are crazy hard, lab is hard and hw's are the only thing that can bring your grade up so DO THEM",0
 Gave us the opportunity to focus on experiential learning not testing. Our class ended up with two entries accepted to Greenlight Michigan contest at MSU with one winning $5K.  Barcley (goes by first name in class) is not conventional and seems more focused on the high energy start-ups in San Fran and the Valley than the uptight mid-west.,1
Dr. D is such a caring and funny person. She teaches in a way that you remember the material and is wonderful about helping if you dont understand. Such a smart lady but so down to earth.,1
Typical mathcollege course. NEED to do the work to understand and pass the exams. Ask questions too. Professor Lewis is a great teacher. She was so helpful. Best math teacher Ive had. She committed to helping you learn. Shes not difficult! The math itself is. But it doesnt have to be that way if you put the work/time in that is needed. Simple.,1
He rambles about things in class for 3 hours about things that are not relevant to the course material at all. Tests are entirely based off of memorizing sentences from the textbook. Very poor communication during class and often loses focus which makes him hard to follow.,0
"Professor Sherwood is the consumate professional; always willing to lend a helping hand when needed. Very responsive, and her subject knowledge is very high. I would gladly sit as one of her students in any class she teaches; she's very smart and a caring person with a great smile too! God bless you Ms. Audra! J",1
Professor Burman is hilarious and helpful. She is easy accessible outside of class and always shows that she cares about you and your learning. Show up to class and do your work- attendance is not mandatory but it does reflect on your grade in the class.,1
Super interactive and enjoyable class! She is passionate about the topic and provides very good examples. Doable readings and fair assignments. Just be in class and get a good mark!,1
Amazing professor! Enthusiastic and really makes the course interesting. His courses are great - totally recommend them!,1
"Professor Allen is funny and is super fascinated by earthquakes. There are course captures that allow you to not go to his lectures. Really recommend re-watching his lectures before taking exams. Midterms and Finals are fair, GSIs are really helpful too.",1
"This course was one of the hardest courses I took. I thought it would've been easy, but it's not. I barely passed this course, only because I was emailing him 24/7, worrying and freaking out I wasn't going to pass. It's A LOT of quizzes and your final is an essay that has a lot of requirements",0
I genuinely enjoy showing up to Katey's class. She is an amazing professor who explains everything in depth and makes her lectures interesting.,1
"You need to listen to lecture and take notes, but all of the tests come straight from his lectures. He is pretty laid back and covers the material well, you just need to make sure you do all of book reviews and the service learning project.",1
"Dr Ouyang knew the subject matter very well.  Text Book was a waste.  Current events portion was good in that we had to explore issues with other students.  Online homework app was poor.  Two papers and a final exam were required.  For a non-accting major, it was a lot to absorb in such a short time.  I did learn the topic thoroughly though.",1
Simply: He is a great professor.,1
bring a pillow....ZzZZzZzzzZz....1 group pres./1 individual/midterm/final thats his class...from what i rem. i had good power naps in his class.,0
"Overall, I loved having Jim as a professor and enjoyed listening to his stories and experiences. The class consists of a lot of busy work and assignments. Assignment expectations can be disorganized/unclear which was frustrating at times. Gives study guides which consist of book pages from the textbook that you need to read for the test.",1
"Mr. Riley was a good teacher for the most part, he is nice and approachable and will listen to any questions. Bio 101 was a little hard but it is definitely possible to get an A if you work for it; some people got 95 or 100 on the tests and others got 60s. Overall, he wasnt my fav teacher ever, but hes still a good choice",1
"Pros: passionate about his teaching, funny, helpful, gives extra credit  Cons: gets so excited he can't be understood, goes off on tangents often. Test questions have material that wasn't covered in class.",1
"Buhler is a basic professor who is out to prove a point. If you really want to learn the concepts, take an online Algorithms course, or just read CLRS by yourself.  You'll learn more and get your money's worth. 541T is not worth the tuition cost or time. If you do take it, be sure to cheat on HW. Everyone else does.",0
"Honestly Professor Schap is actually really enjoyable and can be funny in lecture. However, his material is very challenging and he grades tough. Every class will go 5 minutes over so be prepared for that if you have a class after. Additionally reading the text and doing the problem sets are a must to do well in the course.",0
Awful,0
"Interesting guy with lots of great stories. He will tell you up front though that he is a TOUGH grader, which he is. He is unorganized with his lecturing and has very few grades. He will also take like 2 months to grade papers.",0
Great Professor! Explains well and clear grading criteria. No surprises,1
"You do have to work for a good grade, but Mike is generally an especially relatable professor to students. If you are looking to knock out some science credit, a class with Prof. Konen may be a worthwhile option for you.",1
"Being willing to take control of your own academic course is necessary to succeed with Dr. Green. Being invested, curious, and willing to put in the effort to discuss the literature IN CLASS is going to help your class experience. Green will push you as a scholar--and that's a good thing.",1
"She was terrible, annoying to communicate with.",0
"Took him for FALL2020 online, there's a quiz after every chapter (8) and a final concert report. Activities are done through a required online program which is also the book, some writing assignments, nothing is difficult, the book has all the answers you need, just read through. His work is organized and can be found in your canvas calendar.",1
"Miller is the most amazing and genuine professor that I have ever had. He really cares for his students and just wants to interact with everyone. If you need an English class, definitely take him. You won't regret it!!!!",1
"Dr G is by far the best instructor I've ever had! He is extremely knowledgeable (about EVERYTHING) and very passionate about environmental issues. He's also very accessible and willing to help you out. That being said, this is a HARD class - there 's an enormous amount of work between study guides, personal responses and other projects.",1
Toby is a really nice guy. Wants his students to do well. The class is an easy A if you participate and do the papers.,1
"This class is a decent amount of work, very manageable, however the teacher is very rude.",0
"As a professor, Tom really changed my life. His course made me realize my strengths in math and he is very accommodating and encouraging. He cares about his students and that really made me respect him. The course requires some strong writing skills, unlike most math classes, but Tom is always there to help. Thank you, Tom.",1
I re-took Thermo with Rolle and I think I learned more from him than my previous professor. He focuses more on the theory compared to doing problems. He has lots of experience and can give an example for nearly every topic in the class. Home problems are hard but tests aren't too bad if you stay on top of things. Take him.,1
"Prof. Dowding is one of the best professors I've had at BU. He is intimidating at first, especially with his 39-page syllabus (not an exaggeration). He tries to weed out the lazy, and it works. If you're lazy and don't care, don't take the class. He makes you work hard, but it's worth it in the end. He makes the class interesting and fun. ",1
"She cares a great deal about her students who also care. If you are often late or absent, she will drop you from the class. Her lectures can be difficult to follow and her responses are not always clear. I recommend reading the chapter beforehand and taking notes. This helps you follow along with her work. If you try hard to pass, she'll help you.",1
"Very quiet teacher and it seemed like he didn't know what he was talking about half of the time. He just read off of slides. He mentioned class is pointless, but it's just a prerequisite. 60% of the grade is from exams; he gives study guides, but the exams are nothing like the study guides. He curves class average to a 75% on exams and final.",0
"Gives ok notes and examples are mostly from the book. If you can learn by yourself, then you don't need to go to lecture. exams are like homework/in class examples but are still different. did a little below averages for midterms not sure about the final and ended up with a C with the curve.",1
"She yelled at students when asked any questions, and always had mistakes in her quizzes and practice problems she went over in class. She was not clear in lecture, would rarely respond to email. She only let us see some quizzes and because she always made mistakes it left us wondering if our grades were correct. only take if ready to teach yourself",0
"Her lectures tend to be boring, doesn't speak loud enough and has a monotone voice. I didn't learn too much from her, mostly from the SI for the class. She's straightforward about what she wants you to know but sometimes leaves out important info. I wouldn't take her class if you don't like teaching yourself most of the material.",1
"I do not have professor Hartman as a teacher myself but he works with me often in the math lab. He is so helpful and works very hard to be sure that he is tutoring to your personal satisfactory.  If he is this great of a tutor, he must be a fantastic math teacher as well. I would definitely recommend him as a teacher without doubts.",1
"This class wasn't the best, but definitely an easy A if you show up to class and listen to the lecture. There is a quiz once a week, but she tells you exactly what is going to be on it the class before at the end of the lecture, so make sure you come to class. A summary for homework every week on a chapter and a few follow-up activities.",1
"He is an okay professor. He is very quiet. Good thing is he gives homework but not as a grade but instead as bonus and its based off effort. The class was hard to me , but then again I hate math. Lastly if you do all the homework you can raise you're grade by 2 letter grades. I should of had a D., but because I did all the homework I got a B.",0
"Too much reading. Every session, get ready for a quiz (single multiple choice question). I understand that the reading are for our knowledge but she gave too much reading (two books for a one meeting). If you dont know how to manage those, you will fail. Exams are essay type and not so hard. TA are nice and helpful.",0
I can think of few people who can better teach firsthand about ecosystems and the positive impacts of environmental restoration than Lisa Jo. Taking a class with her (especially this one) doesn't feel like work even though you have to put in the hard work to show what you've learned. Don't worry: you'll want to learn with her. She's the best.,1
"Very passionate about her course, was a lawyer for years so she knows what she is talking about. Attendance is 30 percent so if you go to class it helps out your grade a lot. If you don't want to go to class don't take her. The only downside is she is not good with technology so she needs some reminders about that, but she is very fair.",1
Great,1
"Super nice, easy to talk to and reach. Gives video feedback for major assignments, always willing to talk about the subject more. Course theme is print vs. digital: a bit boomer but still fun. Textbook is flawless and fun. Make sure that you have good grammar, or else your grades will feel it! If you can get excited about the topic you'll do great.",1
"Eric is an awesome prof. Even though he is an incredibly strict grader, the assignments were reasonable. You have to be willing to put in the work in order to get good grades.",1
"Dr. Gentry is a kind and casual guy. Each lecture he talks a little about the subject at hand, but then creates a discussion amongst the class. This is an unusual style, but a nice refresher from intense lectures. Random pop quizzes will come, but he drops your lowest quiz grade. Overall, his class isnt hard as long as you show up and participate.",1
She's not even a business teacher!,0
"Dr. Nelson is a great professor, because he was able to teach me chemistry when I have very little aptitude for it.  If you need assistance outside of class, he's more than willing to assist you. If you need to take a physical science course, don't miss out on Dr. Nelson.",1
"Great guy, very helpful. HARD CLASS and HARD TESTS! GPA KILLER!",1
Super super sweet woman! Normally out of class 10-15 minutes early... super long powerpoints that get old but are always posted after class. She cares about her students and loves her job... but her tests are not accurate representations of what is taught in class. In class assignments CAN be made up if you present her with an excuse.,1
"I am an English learner and thought that I was gonna fail this class. However, he helped me a lot, and I ended up with a good grade. Just let him know you need help with writing, he is gonna find a way to help. Also, there is no quiz or test in his class.",1
"Funny professor makes class interesting.  If you attend and do the online hw, theres no reason not to get a A.  Recommend taking the class",1
"I find it hilarious how a professor can take the longest time to grade a paper yet can send multiple emails saying that any work turned in late will not be graded unless you are in a ""dying situation."" We are currently in a pandemic and she has missed a lot of classes yet can't forgive her students for doing work tardy. Also doesn't check her email",0
"Nice guy, but the class needs to be planned out a bit more carefully. Doesn't grade with a rubric, so a lot of the points he docks you off seems completely arbitrary. Gives very contradictory critiques. Overall not too bad.",1
Professor Huerta is one of the nicest most caring professors that I have ever had. She is really passionate about what she teaches and really understand that being a student is hard. Sometimes her lectures can be a little slow but other than the class is pretty easy as long as you actually follow along.,1
Best professor I have had!,1
I love Dave Dusseau and would take this class over again with him a million times. Take it. He's an incredible prof.,1
"Positives: She is a great professor, she gives good feedback on work and requires you to put some effortdetail in your work. Provides an opportunity to speak to students from other countries.  Negatives: The assignments may become to repetitive or extensive at times.  Definetly need the book. ",1
Very knowledgable. Went through essays with the professor but failed them each time. Have to give yourself a few days to do the quizzes with them being very long and difficult. Would suggest meeting with her very often to go over your essays over and over till she's very happy with it. Would suggest to show up to every class.,0
"Dr. Hines makes classes entertaining and fun compared to a solid lecture. Also, he helps whenever help is needed. Definitely recommend taking him for any course. Homework is every now and then and really helps highlight the material.",1
"I'v never struggled so much in a class. This guy is impossible to get ahold of through email. He grades so harshly and provides no feedback. His tests are 50% memorizing phylogenetic trees. Seems like a nice guy, but just not the best professor.",0
"she's the sweetest lady but gives way too much hw, up to 13 assignments each class (2 classes/week). translate and read stories before class. no textbook, she gives you pdfs. only a few quizzes but they're very detailed (sometimes things she never taught) and tricky. she's super nice tho, tries to make class fun so we're not bored. i learned a lot.",1
Professor Boyles is the best professor you can take for ENG105 or ENG101! He has a grading contract that states that as long as you do all the work (effort shown) you get an A. You can get an A+ by going to three ASU events that he puts on a calendar. This was the least stressful english class I have ever taken and everything was super interesting!,1
Why is she still teaching?????!!!,0
do not recommend if you care about your GPA. the tests were all hard and he also had many assignments.,0
It is not difficult to do well in his classes if you go to class and listen to what he has to say ON TOP of what he has in his Powerpoint slides. He is a very nice person and  quite cheeky when he wants to be (he has perfected the stink-eye)! He is a incredibly knowledgeable and can be lenient with conflicting midtermassignment dates. Not so bad ,0
"A great teacher to learn economics from. Good lectures with a few good jokes thrown in to help you remember the topic. Simple coursework that, while weekly, never is too hard, and you always have Flannery to talk to if you need help. He will walk you through it and make sure you can understand even some of the crazier topics.",1
Dr. Riffe is the professor you want. She breaks the class material down and sets clear expectations for homework and exams. She is easily the most caring professor I have ever had. Take Dr. Riffe if you want to learn and have fun while learning.,1
Great guy but lectures were long. He honestly tried to make class more interesting by showing us different songs but a lot is music history which can get boring. Go to class because he takes attendance through in-class quizzes. Very clear about assignments/due dates. The textbook is useful for the Materials of Music and Inquisitive assignments.,1
Great Teacher!  He is fair and expect the best out of each student.  Slackers be awarded!,0
"Horrible professor. I would say in my 5 years at WestConn that she is the second worst professor I've ever had. Her lectures give NO information, her exams are not even based on her power points. Out of the entire class, on our exams, the highest exam grade was a 73. Also, she is very rude and judgmental. No information learned. Horrible.",0
"Super hard for a CORE class, cool guy but VERY high expectations.",1
"Though there's a lot of homework in this class it's all very easy. Since it was an online class, the homework was done through a program called Inquizitve and it basically lets you answer questions till you got 100%. There're a few writing assignments and unit tests but those are pretty easy. If you do the work you'll definitely get an A!",1
"I would definitely recommend this professor.  Just go to class,  and make sure you understand how to do the sample tests he gives. Memorize how to do those, and you'll be fine on the test. There is a lot of homework, but you have all semester to do it. You actually learn a lot.",1
"Prof V. is a really nice guy & he knows a TON about geology, but isn't always the best at presenting it. For an intro class it was assumed that we already knew more than we did. He talks fast & crams lots of slides into a lecture, you have to write fast. Tests are HARD but if you study you can do well. Nice guy, gets along with students. Lots of EC",1
Great course that empowers women to keep moving forward and offers all the resources and support PCC has to offer. Really recommend this free class sponsored by PCC,1
Great instructor! Will review a problem until you get it. Has an accent but not difficult to understand.,1
Je l'ai détesté... il se prend pour un dieu! Moi je trouve que c'est un trou de cul... Il n'est pas professionnel pour deux cents.... Je ne comprends pas pourquoi on le laisse enseigner...,1
"This class was one of the most challenging classes that I've had to take so far. However, it was also extremely rewarding. She expects you to be passionate about this course and put in the effort for the quizzes . I'd recommend taking extensive notes in her class. She IS picky about answers in exams, but also specifies what she expects in class",1
Tries to throw you off on exams. Didn't round up my grade when it was within 0.4%,0
No Comments,1
"He is a respectable professor, and his lectures are very meticulous. If you have any questions, he will answer them patiently. In short, he is a great professor.",1
"Never gave assignments back on time. Never gave assignment rubrics when she said she would. All her class is is busy work and her talking about herself. She never answers emails so don't expect to get any advice from her about grades, projects or clarificiation on anything. AVOID AT ALL COSTS",0
"Dr. Arevalo is one of my favorite professors at providence college. Her rating on here is very questionable, she is a super nice lady and I adore her. You must attend her lectures to do well, and she tells you what to expect on the exams. To gain a better understanding I would suggest reading the book as it definitely helped me on her tests.",1
She is so sweet and she explains what she wants done really well and is always available to help,1
"I have never been very good in mathematics, so when I entered this class I was very uneasy. But, Professor WIldman made this class easy to understand and was extremely helpful. All you have to do is ask and he will bend over backwards to help you.",1
"Dr. Brown was awesome. He really is passionate about what he teaches, and he makes his class easy to understand. Heavy work load but a lot of it is very interesting and he goes over everything in class. He really cares about his students and is a really great professor. I would definitely take him again.",1
"Kelsey is a new instructor in the Comm Department. She's a graduate of the undergrad & grad program at ECU, so she understands & knows what it's like being a student. All is clearly stated in the syllabus  no surprises. She genuinely cares about students & makes class fun to come to. She's a younger instructor but doesn't take any mess. Recommend!",1
She is very caring and always willing to help you out if you need help. Her lectures are also very interesting and engaging. I would highly recommend!!,1
"I love every second of our lessons, Morales Sensei makes the class super interesting and he is ALWAYS willing to help you in ANYTHING you could ever need. He makes it all very easy, interesting and FUNNY... WIsh every other professor was like him... Really easy tests and FUN PROJECTS! ",1
I Loved this class. The professor was so helpful. I like that he is specific in what he wants. Easy A if you follow directions and read the materials.,1
"In my opinion, Alana gave difficult tests. Other than that, the course was fairly easy as long as you went to class and took notes. Alana is really passionate about music, so it makes it easier to pay attention. She makes even the most boring topics sound ten times more interesting, and she really likes to demonstrate by singing in class.",1
Mr. Michael is extremely fun and caring. He works with you on any concerns you would have and offers good advice. The only downside is you have to be prepared to reschedule often and make sure you stay on track with your lessons.,1
"I took this class my freshman year and still rather frequently think of St. Augustine. 1/3 of the class would show up and most would not do the readings(a book from 1600 years ago). Nonetheless, I thoroughly enjoyed this class and still wish I had taken more humanities courses. Avoid if your main worry is grades and tests. Curiosity/thinking req.",1
"Dave is THE BEST! He is so hilarious and really cares about what he teaches. He's already retired but decided to come back because ""This is what I do for FUN!"". He always had the whole class laughing and kept us engaged. There is a ""quiz"" every class using the iClicker, but half the time he helps with the answer. He's the best.",1
AP is one of the best professors I have ever had at reynolds. She continually strives to better herself for the sake of her classes. I have had her for three semester and wish I could have continued to have her in my fourth semester. If your willing to learn and try something a little unorthodox I promise she will not disappoint.,1
"Mr. November gave awesome feedback (but was more vague on the major assignment gradings.) Group workshops were helpful bc you get feedback from other people. HW instructions were sometimes confusing, but for the most part, the class was easy. It's creative writing, so you can't be graded on your art/creativity. Textbook needed, not many e.c..",1
"He's the sweetest prof ever but i never knew it'd be possible to be this disorganized. Don't be surprised if he does lose or misplace students' marks and documents frequently. Took his class because people say that its an easy A if you put in the work and do his practices problems. However, over half of my class is failing his course.",0
"Good teacher, always smiling and happy.",1
"Took her class this summer. In class assignments, notes from powerpoints, easy tests straight from notes, easy hw. Boring class only because the info is boring. She trys to make it fun. Very nice women. Willing to help. Easy A if you go to class. I never studied but I went to class everyday and made an A+ in the class. Take her if you want an A.",1
Best teacher ever!!,1
"Make sure you get a good group for your research project! She is VERY unclear on assignments regarding the project but lets you turn things in late and resubmit things, I was stressed out and worried about this class all semester, but if you are staying on top of stuff you're good. Create a relationship with Olga she is very nice and understanding.",0
You will do a majority of your work through MyLabMath with almost no communication with the teacher herself and when you do talk to her she is always aggressive and hardheaded. Your entire semester grade is essentially just the two exams and that's it since she weighs their grade so heavily.,0
The best professor I have ever had so far. Motivated me to work harder.,1
"Very sweet and caring professor! My first semester of college and she gave me a great learning experience/atmosphere!I recommend her to everyone, pretty simple grading scale. You go mrs. p!",1
"Good professor if you do all your work. You do have to put effort on presentations because he is a tough grader. Easy A, I would take him again",1
Excellent instructor! Very clear in his presentation and very organized in his class structure. Regarding the subject matter - thoroughly covers all the bases. You will leave learning so much. Nice guy too.,1
"Suggs rocks as a person, although it was hard to stay awake in his class sometimes. Easy to get an A, assignments are easy/fun.",1
"horrible class. DONT take it.  dan doesn't talk about anything real during class, just rambles on about his opinion on stuff and then will give you random facts to write down so you can write the essays well. paper due every week, do all of them. and id write all the essays so that you can get a good grade. go to class because of random quizzes.",0
We were suppose to have mini quizzes about each reading. Right before the final she decided to cut them out of her grading criteria. I needed help with an essay and scheduled a meeting with her. She cancelled last minute and when I emailed her my question she didn't respond until the day before it was due. She was also late daily and unorganized,0
"Dennis can make u laugh, but is a very good teacher. After having numberous classes w/ he was very helpful",1
Coolness,1
He will work with you should you run into problems. He called me when he did't see my midterm in webtycho. I had sent the test questions by accident but not the completed assignment.,1
One of the best professors!! She's extremely nice and helpful and the class isn't that hard. If you have the chance to get her then do it! :),1
"Mr Debbage was the coolest teacher I have had so far. He was so helpful in office hours, and he added 4 extra credit questions on the final. If you just go to class, and put in a little time to study, you can make a good grade. It was an interesting class, and he got better at teaching it throughout the year as this was his first class he taught.",1
"Dr. H is a great professor and super easy going! This class is very lecture-heavy and a lot of reading but she makes it pretty interesting. Be aware that if you take Anth 360 you'll have to do 15 hours of applied projects, but these weren't bad.",1
Your grade is mainly decided by your tests. HW also counts but she adds it in at the end so you won't know how much it helps you until the end. t's really easy to get in contact with her and she answers really quickly. I've taken Calc 1 before so this was really easy for me but she explains everything with a lot of detail so if you'll be fine,1
"The best you will not regret taking him. He is so passionate about what he teaches and gets the material through to the students. He is the type of person that will get you interested in things you never thought you would ever be in. Just take him the workload is okay, even with more difficult classes",1
"Physics background is important, but I banked on my high school honors physics and did just fine. The book is a must--READ it. This is a COLLEGE course--do independent study. Dr. Longworth is nice, just needs to practice being more confident when teaching. She'll get better, the class has the potential to be really pleasant. Have faith, no fear.",1
"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!! Worst experience. She is so disrespectful towards her students, disorganized, yells at people who are trying hard, blames others for her own mistakes, and insults on a personal level. An overall really terrible experience.",0
"I had Dr. Bartl for GVT this spring. semester and he is absolutely amazing!!! He goes out of his way to help students, and he is super thoughtful. If he calls on you to answer a question, just do your best because he will always redirect your answer on the right path even if you are completely wrong. Dr. Bartl is passionate and SO HOTTTT! 10/10",1
"Very enthusiastic professor who knows his material, but he flies thru information very quickly. The best things u can do for urself in this class is take notes via computer &RECORD THE LECTURES so u can go back to them if u can't keep up with notetaking. + he gives hints on what's on tests AND explains what he wants to see. Don't wanna miss that.",1
I was worried that this class will be strict with style and content like the CSE classes but this wasn't too bad. Mike does a good job at lecturing but I felt rushed with some of the topics (probably because the snow canceled a couple of classes). I didn't like the group project though because my group didn't do work but overall the class is good,1
"His lectures are mind-numbingly boring. Sit in front of the class because he mumbles. The mumbling plus his thick accent makes it really difficult to understand. He only goes over things one time and he does it quickly, like if he's reading from a list and he needs to check off everything. Don't take it if you don't have to.",0
"He's an interesting guy during lectures and easygoing when it came to attendance (class was supposed to be MWF but he made it so we only had lectures on M&W). His tests were nearly impossible to study for. He would say to study class notes and readings, but come test time I had no idea what he wanted. His test curve was what saved my grade.",1
"When I took this course with him in my first year, I so wanted to take a higher level course with the prof again. Got a chance when taking BUS 2440. Amazing prof for both courses",1
she makes differential equations harder than it needs to be. her grading is very strict with not a ton of partial credit. the tests are very difficult to finish in the 50 minutes she gives. when you ask her questions that arent in her notes she gets confused so it seems she doesnt fully understand the material,0
This goofy dude will make you fall asleep. Homeworks are easy and tests can easily be passed if you do the study guide. If you want some good rest I recommend you take this class because his lectures will have you shlumped in no time.,1
"Honestly she is very confusing on what she wants you to do for speeches, assignments and exams are not very clear. Many students in the class were confused some even dropped in the last weeks of class.  I have taken so many communication classes loved all except this one. If you truly want to learn about comm and want a passing grade don't take her",0
"Also, the lectures are very boring. He thinks we are dumb and we don't know anything. He makes us feel like we are uneducated students. I have never felt so low in my life, I have always gotten A's in college except for his class. I recommend to him, respect your students because without students you are not a teacher.",0
Dr. Thrasher was very helpful. I enjoyed the class.,1
Matt Anderson is one of the few professors that actually cares about his students as people.,1
He doesn't give you a review for any test or the final. If you ask questions he makes you feel silly for asking them. He uses the old book and not the one the you are told to buy. Even if you take good notes from the book you could be studying something not on the quizzes/test. and still fail them. He is a nice guy and can be funny at times.,1
"Great teacher. Easy going and extremely approachable. Accounting is a boring topic, so do not expect flamethrowers and circus freaks to make the class more enjoyable. However, she makes the class interesting by inspiring us with her personal experiences (she is an accountant and business owner). Learned a lot from her.",1
She really is great! Helps you understand and relates the course to the real world.,1
He is a very good teacher. His lectures are clearly to understand.,1
"Ms Audra is a very good professor. She talks a lot so we never finish our modules on time. Very helpful and willing to help you in person. She relates stuffs with her personal experience so it was quite interesting. Aplia assignment is the worst because they grade you with average. No matter how good your grade is, if you screwed up once, ur doomed",1
"Make sure you start the projects early, and do the homework review before each quiz/test! The projects were all fairly difficult, designed for a senior level class (which this is), and cannot be done the night before, no matter how many people try. Also, doing the homework review will guarantee you do better on the quiz/test",1
"The lectures were all very long, which could get boring at times but Jansten taught the material well as he truly has a passion for it. Homework and tests were all done online outside of the classroom. Attendance is taken through daily in class quizzes. Very clear about due dates for assignments and offered extra credit opportunity. Good GPA boost.",1
"Mr. Valliere takes his attitude from Comp 1 and puts it directly into Comp 2. There are 3-4 papers to do over the course. Each one he gives plenty of time to start, ask questions about it and gives clear grading criteria about what he wants and how to do it. He is funny, understanding, and makes the class super easy. If you want an easy A, take him",1
frequently gave pointless/unhelpful explanations of ideas. preparation of presentations extremely time-consuming and ultimately pointless. spent large amounts of time on things that seemed straightforward/obvious/unimportant. didn't cover much material. very liberal late policy.,1
"I loved Mrs. Jimmerson! As long as you study the notes that you took in class, the tests will be easy!  She tells random stories in the middle of her lectures, but they are entertaining.  She gives daily quizzes over assigned reading material.  Read everything adn you'll fo great!Overall best English teacher I've had in a very long time!",1
"Definitely does assign A LOT of reading (20+ pages per class) however, i read maybe twice and got an A. The only major grades are the midterm, final, and research paper. She gives you a list of all the terms you have to remember as well as the possible essays and its a lot to memorize but it can be done. She offers a lot of extra credit.",0
"Potential students,Please take your preq.; know it well. has a power control issue. He will tell U up front, he always win. What ever you do do not challenge his authority, He will target U through out the course and make it very difficult for U.",0
"If you like getting good grades this is not the class for you. Don't get me wrong Scott is a nice and helpful guy, but he will make sure you lose points on every assignment. He is a personal guy, but when it comes to your school work have fun trying not to fail.",1
"Do not take this course if you are not extremely, wholeheartedly, 100% passionate about this subject. Dr. Boden pushes his passion on the subject too much, causing for way too much information, homework assignments, and overall workload. All of his assignments can pile up easily if you're not caught up with the class. Watch the lectures and read!!!",0
"He tries his best to teach complex topics. He is not good at breaking down difficult topics, but he is good at working with you through tough problems. It's a difficult class and you need to put work in, and he is very willing to help.",1
goog,1
"One of the worst profs Ive had. She rushes through her slides, and does not give nearly enough time for students to write down what shes saying - let alone understand it. Took two five minute breaks during the lecture, which seems nice at first, but then has to cram material in at the end of the lecture. Her exam questions were very difficult.",0
"By far one of the best teachers I have ever had.  She is tough, but if you do what she asks you will be just fine.  Its English your going to write.  She explains everything very clearly, and if you put in the work she will 100% support you.  She is unconventional in the way she teaches,  but is the 1st teacher that I was able to actually GET IT!",1
Oh Steve.. Steve is that dude. He is one of the boys and was a great professor. Tests is based on 4 tests and he gives very good reviews. Also we has quizzes but were told about them in advance. Much love Steve.,1
He is an excellent human being and professor. Inspired me to continue onto the graduate program. Great mentor and really wants the students to learn and succeed. The class discussions were indepth and often made you forget about the time. I looked forward to his classes and would highly recommend his class to anyone.,1
Hes cool,1
Matt makes stats enjoyable for sure. He's a nice guy willing to help whenever you need it,1
"Very helpful, clearly explains and won't proceed unless you understand. Allows corrections for half credit and he is very patient. This was my 2nd time taking one of his classes. I was really dreading Trig until I saw him in the class offerings. Totally recommend him for anyone who isn't math friendly.",1
"Northrup not only is dedicated to helping students understand the material, but he also cares about his student's wellbeing. He gives great lectures and makes all the lecture material available online for review. Although at times he can be forgetful, he knows this and takes reminders about things graciously. Overall, the best prof I've ever had",1
The worst structure ever! she can't even speak in English fluently... she can't teach and she is awful for master level! Unfortunately she is teaching the most important course in Econ!!!!,0
She was the easiest professor I have ever had. She made everything so much better in my life. I was like Luke Skywalker and she was my Yoda. She taught me a lot. If I didn't have her in my semester it would have been terrible. I would of been a ball of sadness.,1
"WORST class I have ever taken. The discussion class is misnamed, the tests are impossible to study completely for and the paper outlines are apparently written with the expressed purpose of tricking students. Needs to learn to control the volume of her voice- BADLY.",0
She is very nice and caring. She will always remind you of the due dates for her assignment. It is a fairly easy class.,1
This course is a tough one. Sister Derby takes a very long time to grade the projects which makes it difficult to improve the next project. She's not very helpful until after the projects are turned in. Again this is frustrating when you are not aware of the many resources available to research until after the project is turned in.,1
"There are no curves in this class, but you can bump up a grade letter by doing online discussions and one-page essays.  I recommend that you study hard on the midterm or you'll end up with a grade you don't want at the end of the quarter.  There are a few attendance questions that will be on the test.  Lectures and audios are also uploaded online.",1
"I recently had this professor and the class was a hybrid class. It was very disorganized and he changed his mind very often. He would also teach one way, then do it a complete different way saying the first way was wrong. He wasnt very understanding of the class and didnt help anyone who asked for it. He seemed careless and didnt show support.",0
"He is one of the best English teachers I have had. He is the only professor I can stand right now, and he is so funny and optimistic about everything! He is a great guy! And he helps you to write your best. :)",1
"If you took calculus in High School, Don't listen to him because he makes you confused. He is a very smart guy, but he doesn't know how to teach.",0
"A great teacher. If you show up, participate because he gets frustrated if the class is silent. If you are really interested in film, don't assume you'll be watching great feature films because that didn't happen. His use of syllabus is great and extremely helpful.",1
"easiest teacher youll have, but dont let that fool you!  she is super easy but you learn everything she teaches in class! her method is amazing props to her.  she will even tell the class the answers for every quiz and test(even the final) before taking it she is such a good teacher",1

"You have to take this class twice, I took it the second time with Scoville. Expect to put more effort in this class but the payoff is better Arabic. My only complaint is the lack of clear grading criteria; although, that isn't really important in a language class.",1
cool teacher. a lot of what he taught was repeat from my 101 class from my other school but it was a refresher. pass the test he gives you and you will be fine. kind of wishe he would give us grades on our assignments but other than that you watch a lot of viedos for class so make sure you sleep enough or you will fall asleep in there,1
"Overall, I really disliked the class. He talks extremely fast, and is very hard to follow. ",0
"In short - extremely easy class, do the online homework, go to lecture, and do the EASY extra credit he gives you and you should have no problem getting an A.  Love this Professor and would definitely recommend!!",1
The course goals outlined in the syllabus weren't achieved. He went on an unprofessional rant against his colleagues and can be rude to students. I wouldn't have taken this class if it weren't required for my degree. I'd avoid his classes at all costs. Required to buy a textbook that wasn't even used.,0
Micro eco is an easy class overall. But Baruch likes to take an easy class and inject it full of algebra and equations. How many times do I have to calculate the area of a triangle? They shouldn't even teach the concepts just do the math. I feel like I got no applicable knowledge from this class. Idk how students avg 55 on exams.,1
"I never wanted to ditch class because she was so amazing! She's so sweet and nice in office hours! Gives super clear, and easy to follow lectures on very difficult subject matter. Always insightful, fun, chose some amazing books, and always incorporated other critic's thoughts aside from her own. She is one of the best professors I've ever had.",1
"You're mostly on your own b/c his lectures vaguely reflect what's on his lengthy exams. He's extremely condenscending and won't even tell you how to prepare for his very tough exams. Harsh, unfair grader and moody. Avoid!",0
Alex is the type of teacher that is missing in modern academia. He is innovative and passionate.,1
Probably my favorite professor at Clarion. He knows what he is talking about and motivates you to be creative. I loved going to his class even though it was early in the morning. He helps you revise your papers; he was very nice and very helpful. TAKE HIM!,1
"The bad first: Harsh, not very approachable. Waited till the night before a quiz to post slides though hes been saying he's post them for weeks before. Takes forever to grade (didn't get most of the lecture submissions/quizzes back before the final). The good: Hilarious, engages us in class, tests easy, hand writes notes, emphasis on understanding",1
3 things: Physio- study a day before test. anatomy study- 2/3 days before. Physio-use powerpoints/ and chp. summaries. make sure to understand everything on study guide. Easy class idk y ppl dont do well.,1
"Not sure why so many students here love this professor. I find her teaching style to be entirely unhelpful. Lots of outside work because class itself is useless. Little guidance on what she expects on assignments, and then she grades soooo hard. Bad prof. Bad class. Hang on for dear life.",0
"Where do I even start? Perez is AWESOME! He made writing my tech paper so easy by utilizing ""Perez's 12 Step Process"". Classes are really fun & you do most of the work in class. He will work with you extensively if you need the extra help. I really enjoyed writing my paper, learned a ton of skills & highly RECCOMEND him to everyone! ",1
"By far the best prof I've had, a nice and caring person. He understands what hes teaching. Easy grader and his tests are reasonable. He genuinely cares about his students and wants them to do good. He goes out of his way to offer help. He puts more time into his course than any other prof I've seen. Hes doing excellent for a prof just starting out!",1
Really sweet and easy going,1
Professor Niu is a really nice person and her intentions are to help you but her teaching style is bad. She does not explain in a way you'll understand and may be unclear to comprehend. Do not take her if your math skills are not sharp.,0
Iker is great! He cares about students and tries his best to make lecture interesting. No midterm or final just 3 papers.,1
She's a great teacher. Very passionate about Public Relations and knows what she's talking about. If you pay attention to her lectures you will pass no problem without even studying. She wants everyone to pass and makes it very easy to do so!,1
"We took several quizzes rather than large exams, and that helped me to perform better, as we knew the quiz dates in advance and what chapters to know. Attendance was not required, but is totally beneficial. She also gives a day where class is a twitter discussion, (best part of the year). Awesome professor & super funny!",1
"He's interesting in lecture sometimes, and I'm sure he's a cool person. He's just not a great professor. He rambles on, doesn't stick to the plan he has for his own class, and your grade is very much weighted on tests, which aren't even well written. Questions are worded weirdly and most of each test is based off the last night's reading.",1
Lots of work but you can get a good grade if you work for it,1
No Comments,1
"She's a good teacher. However, sometimes she will tell you to change something on your paper and then take off points when grading because that part didn't fit. Also, not very clear grading criteria.",0
"This is not a class to take unless you actually have an interest in local Philly politics. Street tangents a lot when he talks, he has no interest in connecting at all with his students and doesn't grade any of the papers himself. I learned a lot from the guest speakers that came in, if you don't know a lot about politics, i wouldn't recommend.",1
"very bad at explaining the material that he presents in the slides and on the board.  Very monotone, and even sitting in the front row, you can almost fall asleep and the class seems like eternity.  If you can do the homeworks 100% then you will do very well on the exam.",0
"Professor Hill isn't the best teacher, her class is pretty boring, but her tests are almost all of the clicker questions from class and the online quizzes. If you study and come to class, you will do fine in the course.",0
"Honestly, I picked this teacher based on the reviews on this website. I was not impressed at all. I had a difficult time getting in contact with her, calculating my class grade was literally impossible until the end of the semester, and she definitely graded quite harshly for a freshman level class. I would not take another of her classes again.",0
"The reviews people are giving him on here is so inaccurate its sad. He is such a nice professor, yes he has an accent, but just sit in class & listen. Honestly, his lectures don't matter just bring your laptop and keep busy. His 3 exams are STRAIGHT from the textbook, just review the proper chapters and you will literally get an A. Its an easy A",1
Dr. Brown is a great professor. He made sure everyone understood everything. I am extremely lucky to have had him as a teacher because I suck at math.,1
"Very difficult. She grades according to how she views things and does not have any room for error. Grading is very harsh, somewhat unfair. I studied for a whole month ahead of the ECO 103 final and still got a C! If you are not ready to spend 2+ hours a night on Econ just to pass, I would not recommend taking her class.",0
TAKE HIM ONLY IF ur taking this class online. I took him couple years ago and failed the class then retook him online this summer and got an A! He posts all lectures on canvas and they help a ton during quizzes and exams- which he gives 24 hrs for. Very tough grader so just triple check ur work before submitting it. A lot of HW but its 10% EC!,1
"WORST TEACHER EVER. He is a horrible teacher. My friend did better than me and he never went to a single class. Not only that, he's a prick. My friend and I both tried e-mailing him for our grade breakdown, I didn't get one, and his grade was changed for the worse. He even admitted to making the test differently than he teaches. Just awful.",0
"Jon is a fantastic TA, so helpful, and in a short 50 minute discussion he always cleared up any confusion i had.  He's also very personable and chill during class.  Definitely recommend him.",1
Very rough professor. Not very understanding to personal issues that may impact class. Do not take,0
"Professor Jaja was always available after class when I had questions that needed to be answered. You need to pay attention in class and study a lot. Its not an easy A , but if you work for it and asked questions you will do fine. She is very kind and approachable if you are respectful to her as usually expected by any professor.",1
"Jan is fabulous. She is very helpful and understanding. I would definitely recommend taking a class with her. She expects certain things out of her students but its not too much to ask. Her tests are just as she says they are, she does not put something on the test if she didnt tell you it was going to be on there. She is terrific. A+!",1
"If you were a musician in like high school, take this course. This course covers basic music concepts and explores musical periods. Make sure writing assignments get done as well as those exams. There is a quite bit of homework, but with planning and maybe an all nighter it's not impossible to do. DOn't be afraid! Sign up!!",1
"This guys knows what he's talking about but doesn't take himself too seriously. He goes into tangents now and then, which can get a little much. But he helps understand class material using relevant examples. I recommend going to his SI sessions if you need to learn a concept better. Don't bother going for just the worksheets.",1
"She is an fantastic professor! She makes you laugh, she wants you to pass (only if you do the work). There is no midterm or final exam, no quizzes, but you have to do a research paper about a controversial topic of your choice and you have to do weekly assignments about it. The class is really easy if you choose a topic you are interested in. ",1
"Professor Birch is a lovely professor. She is always on time and prepared for lectures, very knowledgeable about international business, and she is always willing to clarify issues and take opinions from the class. The class was rather easy, only three exams but the third one is optional, no homework, and assignments are few but very fun. Awesome!",1
"Dr. Hollis is a super tough grader but his lectures are clear and interesting if you like biology. He is definitely a challenge but if you really want to learn, hes a solid choice. Super nice guy in and out of class, and makes an effort to help anyone who needs it.",1
"Even though he bashes lecture heavy classes his classes are lecture heavy. The lectures were really boring and no one ever really talked in class because Professor Dotts appears very judgemental of viewpoints outside his own. Class is graded on a few things, but they were easy. If looking for an easy, boring A then take this class.",0
"Senora Sanchez truly is a nice lady. She really wants all her students to do well in the course and to learn something new. She's extremely passionate but can sometimes go off on tangents because of it. If you don't like having homework, don't take the class, she gives a lot of it but it's more so tedious than hard work.",1
"This class was definitely enjoyable. Lectures end up being pretty pointless because lecture exams are based off the practice test that he provides the answers for. Labs are fairly easy, but you must attend all of them if you want to pass the lab exams. No homework ever. The presentation is easy and easily graded. Overall great professor. ",1
Dave is my favorite teacher I have had here. His class relates to the real world as well as the book. I reccommend any class he teachers.,1
Do not take this class Find another teacher. Id rather take an 8 am then taking an 11 am with her. She is one of the worst graders I ever had. She is so tough on students and will give an F if you are a few sentences away from the page requirements. Find another teacher because she is very annoying and unhelpful. No good feedback and no 2nd chances,0

"I would definitely recommend taking this class if you're passionate about music. Professor Guzzone is awesome and involved in the music industry so he's extremely knowledgeable. The lectures are 3 hours long, but they don't feel that long when you're listening to the Beatles and watching videos of Bob Dylan in between lecture slides. ",1
"Very good professor, makes everything clear, and goes out of his way to ensure you understand the material.  Says class attendance is mandatory but not enforced but you'll miss critical material 3 tests, 3 HW assignments, no quizzes, possible to cram in the last week w/out reading, only if you attend all in all, best Econ professor, take this class",1
"Heavy on homework load, but clear on expectations and approachable. Start on homework assignments ahead of time if possible. This is an easy to manage class if you stay on top of the homework assignments. Make sure you make time to read!",1
"Is obsessed with the ""chi square"".  It is funny when she gets upset for no reason.  A strange woman.  Yelling ""MRS. WILSON"" for a lab exam to begin was like begging for candy.  Interesting person.....",0
Dr. Parker was really flexible this summer. He provided extensions and was always willing to help us.,1
"Professor Calkins was one of my favorite English teachers I've ever had. Her homework is really easy and tolerable. Once it gets into writing the research paper, she assigns more writing assignments which is where time management is key. She wants to see her students succeed and will always be there to help. Gives great extra credit opportunities!",1
Great professor. Incredible analytical skills. Cares about her student's success.  Her expectations are clearly communicated. Her assignments are fair. Participate in the discussions in her course and do your readings you'll do great. Must admit that the readings are challenging so take notes when you're reading them.  ,1
"Professor Dominguez is a fair grader. If you make a mistake that was not covered, you will not be marked down. There are 4 papers, a multiple choice final, and extra credit -- Go to the extra credit! The hardest part is he forgets we are all not writers; You will only have one week to write each paper. This is what makes the class truly difficult.",1
"I enjoyed coming to class each day. The stuff you learn you can actually put to good use. We had 3 tests (lowestdropped) and a final (got review guides for each exam). He was very on top of current events. Did give 10 attendance assignments, but very hilarious so just come to class and you'll be fine. Responds quickly to emails. Take this class!",1
"Dr. Veve is a good professor, he truly wants all his students to succeed in his class. Reading the textbook does help, but I made an A without ever reading. The powerpoints and homework are a huge help and a lot of his test questions are pulled from the two. He only grades you on 3 exams, homework/attendance, and the final.",1
Great class! Great professor!  Very helpful and very nice!,1
Amazing person and teacher. Don't think twice just take her,1
"She lectures RIGHT off of her slides, but includes photos/maps that she refuses to put on D2L so they're inaccessible. Her lectures are the driest I've been to, even though the material is interesting. I had to be 3+ cups of coffee in to not fall asleep during this class.. Save your money and time; avoid this prof like the plague.",0
"! If you ask him a question most times he wont answer and will say well if you read your notes you would know. He also graded extremely hard, gave very difficult exams with over 70 multiple choice questions and short answers. No laptops or talking in class. If you disturb class in any way he will absolutely lose it.",0
The class was eye opening and should be offered in high school. Readings and discussions helped me to gain a lot of knowledge about inequalities and how to deal with them in my future career as social worker. She made it interesting.,1
SAVE YOURSELF AND YOUR GPA!,0
"Ms. Gordon is THE BEST math teacher I have ever had..and that's saying something. She explains everything, does not skip steps when working problems-extra points for attendance; totally MyMathLab, no book. Take her! I made an A and understood everything.",1
"I was interested in this language but the professor herself always had useful tips to help you improve your speaking and writing. The class wes a bit easy for me; and that could be because i was already learning before her class. There are no quizzes, only homework and short readings/exercises. Exams were sometimes over activities. Received a A-",1
the easiest course ever,1
"Rachael is hard working and amazing, and her classes are enjoyable! She will do anything to help you out, and taking higher level classes with her was a lucky deal.",1
"She is a fun teacher.  Can get off track and ramble at times.  Knows her stuff, but you have to be proactive with her to learn skills.  That is just the ""way she rolls.""",1
"The physics in this course is really not that difficult contrary to what an average student might say. This course's use of mathematics, however, is too difficult for the student to properly understand without prior training. On that note, I vehemently recommend spending 2 to 3 weeks before the course starts learning the required vector calculus.",1
"I love her! You can tell how much she cares about her students and how much she loves what she does. She's the grandma that you wish you had. Her class was easy, not many tough projects, and she was very understanding if you had an issue understanding the material. Class isn't memorization based, she wants you to learn how to think critically.",1
Excellent professor. He goes to great lengths to help his students. Definitely take him if you are an EE.,1
Great teacher. She is super helpful and really cares about her students. It is a flipped classroom so you learn at home and do exercises in class.,1
"Dr. Porfleet is amazing.  She is a wonderful woman who really wants her students to connect what they are doing in class with their lives.  Her classes are fun and make you learn a lot about yourself.  If you have the chance, take one of her classes!",1
"Took her for both anatomy 1 lecture and lab. Her lectures are interesting, she makes analogys to help her students remember material. Makes an effort to know her students names. Her tests are fair, if you study and attend the test review you will do just fine. I am scheduled to take her anatomy 2 course in the spring.",1
Grades are due in 5 days... she hasn't graded anything in over 3 months. You'll be expected to write huge summaries on topics that are barely a paragraph long (usually 3 huge summaries per chapter). She doesn't answer her emails either. She allows rewrites if you want a better grade... too bad she hasn't graded the original paper yet. 4/10,0
"Shes pretty nice teacher, theres a lot of hw, but its easy, just dont wait till the last day its due to do it all. its all due a certain day so you have time to do. She goes over it so if you have questions shell help you out. Its a lot of to remember so don't miss any class! I work around 45 hours a week and still passed.",1
"Professor Egan is the man. For Eating Ethics, he's a great professor. The lectures are interesting, and he basically gives you an A for attending class. You have to try harder to not get the A in this class. Plus its 4 credits, requires some writing work in recitation, but other than that the class is soooooo easy. Def. a GPA booster, take it!!!!!!",1
"Took his class for 131 & barely passed. Idk why I decided to take him for college Algebra ,its useless because he teaches you his way and expects you to know all the formulas already. He makes fun of the students and rants in class instead of doing lectures. He gives very few test thats why I took his class but he doesnt curve grades. Hes awful!",0
Rosenburg is hilarious. Easily the funniest professor I've ever had. Lots of home quizzes but they're all easy. Speeches are graded kindly.,1
"There is no grace period for lateness. Once you miss your name when he calls attendance, you're late, end of discussion. Relies heavily on the text. Readings must be done. Tests can be easy if you study. Pop quizzes.",0
"These German classes have been structured better than any other foreign language classes I've taken. Each night after class you have homework, but it's easy and really helps you grow your knowledge of the language. The grades for all of the assignments are fairly divided, the in person lectures are great, and the textbook is easy to understand.",1
"He's a nice guy, but he's not an effective teacher. He is very excited about his subject & is fun to listen to, but his lectures don't reflect his tests well. I think he has way too much info to teach in a short span of time. His tests are way too long. He said he does this on purpose b/c in an emergency you won't have time to think about answers.",0
"Thrasher was always late. ALWAYS late. When my grandfather died, she was very understanding and allowed me to retake a test, but other than that, when I had questions I received no help at all. Also, her tests are ridiculously long.",1
Offered help when needed during office hours.,1
"The professor is knowledgeable and brilliant in his field, he is kind, fun, and wants the student to succeed. I will seek out another class that he teaches just to be around this teacher again. He is positive and is a pleasure to be around!",1
"Am a poor student in math but Mr. Rohan made it possible for me to get good grade with his amazing lectures. Lots of bonus points, good reviews and clear gradings. He is also accessible outside class. Great teacher take him if you want an A in precalculus and trigonometry",1
"Dr. Bates is extremely helpful and interesting, but you need to go to her for the greatest amount of help. If you are struggling, she will do everything to make sure you get a good grade in her class. DON'T SLACK OFF, because she does expect a lot, and rightfully so.",1
"Walker was one of the best professors that I've encountered, not only in the Kinesiology department but LSU overall. I would definitely take his class again if given the opportunity.",1
Best Prof i will ever have especially for Linear which most kids fail. Got an A+ and studied the 2weeks prior to the exam. His exam was an exact copy of the review. His explanations are perfect. Makes sense. Does many examples. Rather than just easy,1
"Dr. Jones is the best professor I have ever had! If you are willing to do the work (which is worth it) she will help you in any way she can. She has an endless knowledge base in the subject area of English Education. She makes every topic interesting and gives great resources for future teachers! Love, Love, Love her!",1
She is by far my favorite teacher here at STAC. She's so passionate about English and seeing her students do well. She is such an amazing professor that I am taking her again next semester. She makes hard topics more bearable. YOU MUST USE THE TEXTBOOK FOR THIS CLASS!!,1
"Nicola's use of the Canvas website had a lot of difficulties. she has pop quizzes and would take pictures of the board but then forget to post. I emailed her once asking how to turn in an assignment because it was unclear on Canvas, and she never got back to me. Overall, Nicola and her TA's taught this class with little regard for her students.",0
"Ben is absolutely one of the best professors I've had! If you are a history buff like myself, this course is right up your alley. Everything he says has meaning-- so listen! He is able to convey exactly what information you must know for any quizzes or tests in a comprehensive manner. I look forward to Ben's lectures! He is also pretty hilarious!",1
I feel this is the hardest and most awkward class I have ever taken. He's a cool teacher and all but just AWFUL methods. I highly suggest taking any other teacher you possibly could!!,1
"I took this course online.  As long as you read the assigned work & participate in the discussion board, you shouldn't have any problems.  Grading was done every few weeks, so it wasn't always up-to-date, but you'll know your test score upon completion each week.  Personally, I would recommend this course & teacher. You will learn some great stuff!",1
"Very cool guy, a little odd but in a good way! Like's to start class with some music. Very funny and honest. He will make you do some work, but not to much. Great professor all around.",1
Very dry boring class. Harsh grader when it comes to papers. Pay attention to her nitpicky grammar suggestions. I had to work my butt off to get a good grade on her papers.,1
Unclear with expectations. Expect to teach yourself most of the subject matter if it's important to your education or career. Double check HIS work...,0
"Professor Kim ""doesn't believe in giving 5/5."" Lectures were live and recordings not provided unless requested. We read 3 books + 300 pages of historical sources. Sections counted for 45% of our grade. Very interesting and important materials, but I found lectures oddly mundane in discussing the lived experiences we read about. An insightful class.",1
"Professor Kubota has a great sense of humor and is always great fun in the classroom. However, she does get right to work and makes sure that the class learns what they need to during the lesson. Towards the end of this course it does get really fast-paced and difficult. But that has more to do with the material not really professor Kubota's fault.",1
"""More and more people, less and less land"". That's his motto throughout the semester. I absolutely love Mr. Pierce as a professor, take his class if you want to opt out of bio or chem. Also be prepared for a lot of stories, and to ""be behind"" in class. Best professor i had all semester, 10/10 would definitely recommend.",1
Such an easy A!! I didn't go to one lecture and I have a 95 in the class. I think I had like 5 assignments the whole semester and they would take at most 10 min. He's a very sweet guy and definitely knows his stuff if you're actually interested in music. I would definitely recommend it for your first semester and it's a GPA booster!!,1
"You can tell Tchaprazov wants you to succeed and he's an interesting guy to listen to. You have quizzes after a few topics based partially on lecture, but mostly on the reading, which he goes over in detail in class, and the readings are all stories or poems so it's not bad. You have a paper on the end, but he's a really fair grader!",1
"Barcley isn't your average professor, and I say that in the most positive way I can. Traditional classroom is traded for a chance at a hands-on experience with entrepreneurship. If you have a great idea for a startup, Barcley has the means, the drive and the connections to take you far.",1
Professor Beck was an incredibly kind and genuine professor. She is caring and extremely accommodating. I think her class is an easy A if you put in the work. I would recommend going to her lectures and taking notes on what she says and really paying attention. The content is actually pretty interesting as well. Would recommend this class for GenEd,1
"Amazing teacher, captivating lectures and very interesting topics. Take any class with him and you won't be disappointed.",1
Nice guy,1
He cares about his students and is helpful in every sense.,1
"Dr. Hammer is the best of the best. She changed my life by teaching me to write, to think, and to be better.",1
"Professor Nuneville is very experienced in the law community, and she brings in several great guest speakers. Shes funny, smart and eager to help with anything you need. She also gives out free answers to the exams. A+.",1
"Dr. B is the best professor I've had yet. He makes class lively and enjoyable. If you listen in class and do the homework, it's a simple A+ too. I would highly recommend him!",1
"Come to class prepared. I took it in the summer so it was 5 weeks. We read through 4 THICK books before the 5 weeks ended. You MUST come to class prepared (have read) otherwise you will fall behind very quickly. This class is not for you if you think you can breeze through undetected. Good professor, is willing to help you if you help yourself.",1
"He will never reply your email. Whatever you do, he will give you a B.",0
"She interrupts students and is very harsh when she doesn't hear the answer she wants right  away. Her quizzes are filled with answers that are extremely similar, or mean almost the same thing which makes it hard to get a good grade on them. She is very picky when it comes to papers and gives a rubric which seems completely arbitrary.",0
"She was very helpful. The class also isn't a lot of work; there is just a small homework assignment after every lesson, 4 quizzes and exams, and the final exam. Overall, it isn't a hard class as long as you ask for help if you need it. She is very clear on what she wants and will help you with anything. ",1
"This was the most disorganized course I have taken. Prof Lai did not teach the material well. He often talked about topics but did not explain the theory or solve any problems. The textbook chosen was also terrible, and did a poor job of explaining topics. He tries to make the course easy by giving lots of hints, but you end learning nothing.",0
"She is very nice and tried to provide as many examples as possible for better understanding the material, reading before the lecture are encouraged since her accents it's a bit strong therefore you may not understand all her lecturer. Also, she is a good marker too, willing to give you extra credit if you can show her that you are participate",1
"He is extremely passionate about what he is teaching, which makes you more excited to be there. Sometimes hard to follow, due to amount of material covered in each class. Assigns LOTS of readings each night, but do the readings! Things will make more sense in class and he gives pop quizzes.",1
"Very disorganized, late to class and not the best person to explain a course to students who aren't good with math in general. I would not recondmend taking her but I would recommend Michael green.",0
Study hard for these tests. The lectures are all power-point but Dr. Hill does a great job interacting with the class even though there are over 200 people. The clickers really help involve the class as well. Dr. Hill certainly knows her material in the class so do not hesitate to ask a question and she'll gladly help you out.,1
Wonderful professor and advisor Attendance matters,1
Lectures are extremely boring and her accent makes it kinda funny,1
You're going to watch a lot of videos. Some of them will be irrelevant and some will be tied into the lecture at the end and be really interesting. Overall an easy class to pull an A in and David is a really great guy to interact with both in and out of class. Study your notes (as sparse as they are) and the quizzes and exams will be a breeze.,1
"I absolutely love Professoressa Miller. She's very open about students asking questions and really makes everyone interact/participate. It did feel somewhat intimidating to try speaking Italian with others or aloud, but she knows how to make you feel at ease. You do need to put in some effort but overall, very easy.",1
"Ok so here's the thing about Arevalo:She can't speak English well but the class is so easy you can teach yourself. Show up for class because she knows when you're not there. She is a relatively nice person, and funny on some occasions. She will NOT repeat herself so you're better off getting the information from someone else. Overall she's not bad",0
The class is relatively easy. The only issue is that every grade comes from tests and is focused on auditory memory. The Professor is an easy going and nice guy.,1
"Very good lecturer. Has a very expansive understanding of the real world application of the lecture material which made lectures more entertaining. Class was difficult by nature, but he gave tons of optional resources and very clear solutions/lecture notes, so even if you didn't understand everything from lecture there were other methods to learn.",1
"Two papers, pretty much graded on how much you write. I have my doubts that he even reads them. Very easy",1
"Wonderful teacher!!  Helpful, understanding of various students situations.  Works well with young students as well as older returning students.  Overall good hearted person who cares about her students.  Teaches how to succeed in college and as a returning student, she helped me very, very much.  I'm still using the skills she taught me.",1
"The professor is very compassionate and resourceful. If you're stuck on an assignment, he provides a lot of good feedback and is willing to devote his time to assist his students. There are 5 quizzes, a midterm, and a final exam.",1
She is a wonderful Professor! She is also comical. Joe Buttons.. :),1
"super easy, but if you are struggling or are gonna miss class just let her know and she will help out however she can",1
"I don't like thw fact that he uses a website through a website for the class just stick to one. The subscription for the second website is not free and students must pay for it on their own. I have not struggled to figure out what was going on using the canvas website until this class, every other class was clear and straight forward.",0
"Professor Cupani is so sweet and I had her for the Chemistry lab and it was a breeze! She broke it down step by step,Had a video for us to watch if we didnt understand her so how could you not pass! But if you skip lab you will not pass! All you have to do is show up ,do your labs,put the labs in your lab manual and turn it in at the end",1
"Easy professor, and interesting course. I recommend attending class often. She shows a lot of videos that are helpful for essays. There was only one in-class exam for the midterm. All other grades were essays of about 3 pages submitted online. The final  was even an essay. Fun professor, and very interesting material. Take course with her!",1
"This man is the love of my life. Awesome professor. His stories and his jokes make the class what it is. His lectures are pretty lengthy, however, so show up every week. Tests aren't too hard, they're you're typical psychology tests. Cherish any class you have with him, not all psych professors are this good.",1
Take Professor May! you will not be disappointed! if you're looking for a class where learning and fun are integrated-this is the professor to take! such an amazing and caring professor who will work with you to succeed. Ive never laughed so much in class I wish i could take all my classes with him! hands down my favorite professor of all time!,1
wonderful teacher,1
"10/10. Smart, motherly and casual. Always felt calm and relaxed during her lectures and was didn't regret once for taking her class. Course divided into: 3 tests, 10 weekly quizzes, and one essay with clear criteria on marking. If you want a chill, laid back professor who makes you luv Biology, it's Dr. Gonzalez.",1
"He's really energetic and tries to get you to participate as much as he can. He only tells you the main points from the slides but some of the side info he doesn't teach can also be on the test so beware. He doesn't let you pick your group which kinda sucks but you have to put up with it. TL;DR energetic, goofy, professional, not that bad.",1
"BLESS MARK BERKSON. Seriously, what a sweetheart. His lectures are always fun to listen to. He's clearly very passionate and makes learning the material enjoyable. TAKE DETAILED NOTES! That's all you really need. Also, his dad sweaters are something to look forward to.",1
"I took his graduate digital communication systems course. He's a hard professor without a doubt, but he tosses in little jokes, which i enjoyed. you MUST do homework to understand the class. he's very friendly and approachable. he does give BIG curves as well for final grades.",1
Excellent teacher.  Knows everything and can explain everything to you in like... 5 minutes.,1
"Dont waste your time with this professor. Nice person, but terrible teacher. If youre not a strong test taker, you will not survive. Also have fun purchasing a brand new text book, Lab Manual, Lab Guide AND online software (which you wont even use) no opportunity to earn any points other than the 3 100 point exams and quizzes every Mon/Wed.",0
"Professor Krutz is an extremely cool guy. He introduces the most basic concepts of SE in Freshman Seminar and he does it well. Even though I am interested to see how he teaches a more in-depth SE class (because Freshman Seminar will be one of the easiest courses you will take), I have no doubt that he isn't good at teaching more advanced classes.",1
The pace and organization of this course is appreciated. The professor has taken into consideration that most people taking this course need it as a prerequisite for a health care related degree. Many of us do not have experience in advanced psychology and the class was organized in a way that made it interesting and easy to understand.,1
"So when I had him I thought he was a good guy, but whenever i asked serious questions, he would come back with really smart ass answers that were unnecessary. He is a fair grader but he likes to keep people between A- and B+... participation he rarely gives over a 90% and rarely over an 18/20... just to warn you, its not hard, but not so fun either",0
"She's very unclear, her lectures are beyond boring, helpful I'm sure but also at times I'm questioning relevancy. The entire class is one long group project which she can be very unclear about, she lets you know when things are due the day before and then when no one turns it she questions why. Pretty easy and fast grader,that is the only plus side",0
"If you ask, he lets you take filled out study guide into exam (some people don't know this). Lectures are dry but informative. He definitively knows what he is talking about. Great Scholar. Sometimes a little high minded. He is teaching you - he does not want your opinion, he wants you to learn.",1
"He is a story-teller, he always talks about his experiences. Attendance is mandatory but you get 1 excused absence. He enjoys what he teaches also all of the slides are online. His test are tough and you need to study.",1
"One of the best professors I had at ASU!  Responds to student participation If you don't care about your grade, don't expect a good one. Common sense. The workload is very light-read, blog, show up to class, discuss, open book exams. He's a down-to-earth guy, very helpful, and treats you the same way you treat him.  Highly recommended!",1
I was horrible in math and with this class I made an easy A. Gives one extra credit opportunity. Dr. Brown is very sweet and willing to help. He always makes sure everyone understands before moving on. Best math teacher at AUM!,1
Prof. Wood is an amazing and smart woman. She gives lots of assignments and two papers. Keep up with the assignments and reading and you will do fine. I could of done better but my grade is my fault so dont let that discourage you. She is also very understanding if you speak to her and let her know what is going on.,1
Awesome professor. Uses lots of real life examples so lectures are entertaining and enjoyable. Tests aren't too bad and lowest score is dropped. Easy online discussions and weekly quizzes. All info needed for tests are on lecture slides and chapter summaries are posted on Moodle so no need to even buy the book. Highly recommend!,1
This class was definitely not what I thought it would be. Heavily reading based. If you read the articles you'll be fine and he gives you opportunities to miss some of the reaction papers he assigns. The book essay is a big part of your grade: START IT EARLY! Overall he's an okay teacher but kind of boring and the class is not based on medications.,1
"Had review sessions for every quiz and test. Lots of work, but every genetics class is. If you have to take genetics, take him!",1
I took her course this past semester and her study guide saved my life! They are so helpful and she is so caring and willing to discuss any issues or concerns.,1
"I was doing okay in his class and then I unexpectedly had to miss a week 7 after a friend died and Dave was incredibly supportive and helpful. He gave me extra notes, supplemental assignments, extensions and exemptions to ensure that I could do well in his class as well as checking in with me after every lecture. Amazing educator and person.",1
"I signed up for an in person class, but everything is on MyMathLab. I was sceptical at first, but it was actually pretty easy. Only needed to go to class for exam days and the final. Very few people show up on any given day so if you need one on one tutoring with him, he is able to do that and is good at it.",1
Mrs.Schultz is very hard core about making sure you do what she assigned you. Hard to understand at times. But overall good teacher.,0
"One of the best professors at CRC. He only teaches at night and his lectures get a bit boring but show up & you'll get an A! Quizzes are online for Geo300 and geo301 labs and hw are due the next class but he is lenient on late work. Tests don't have anything you've never seen. Rent his E-books on chegg, way cheaper",1
"Easy to take notes with the way he teaches, hes very clear. Just graded on homework, (and you can easily get 100% on each homework assignment) we only had 4 tests, and multiple opportunities for extra credit! The only thing I wish I could change is being able to use notes for the tests but otherwise overall good experience with this professor!",1
"Mr. Narin is cool...I enjoyed his class, textbook used was easy to follow and exercises were many to learn from...If you are structured and committed take this class!  If you want to be spoon fed take another class.....",1
"URGH! If you are taking this course as a pre-req for nursing, DO NOT BOTHER WITH HIM! He is a mess. His teaching skills are all over the place, he's' very unorganized and HE IS RUDE AS HELL! He makes you buy the book & connect and doesn't even use either! I unfortunately had to drop the class because honestly I just couldn't stomach him anymore.",0
"Fermin is a great prof in my opinion. Overall, lecture do get quite boring sometimes, but Fermin is very passionate and knowledgeable in his specialty. It was only boring to me because the course content itself did not interest me very much. Tutorials are mandatory attendance and quite useful. Reading is assigned from books instead of textbooks.",1
"Kathleen is a super nice women. She's talkative and clearly passionate about writing. She's very helpful with any assignments she assigns and clear about the assignment criteria. Resume, cover letter, LinkedIn, thank you emails, and job related documents are created and revised in this class. I would personally recommend.",1
Pretty easy A. There's about 5 tests you take at the testing center. They are super easy if you study the practice test he gives you beforehand. Online homework is time-consuming but gives you many chances to complete it. I didn't use the textbook as much as I had originally expected. He provides PPs for each lesson. I would definitely recommend!,1
"Had Prof Triplett for both MGF 1106 and 1107. Hands down one of the best professors I've had. He wants you to learn the material but also understands that formulas and processes can be awkward to memorize and will let you use notes. Be prepared for a lot of homework, especially if you take a condensed summer class. Great Prof all around.",1
Judson is a great professor. She knows the material very well and she is always extremely kind and willing to help if you have questions. Skipping class is a bad idea because she gives attendance quizzes most days. The tests aren't hard but for some reason I struggled on the final hardcore! There's also one group project and 3 papers. Not too bad.,1
"Goldiner was an absolutely inspirational and intellegent professor who has a unique, raw and real view of society. I took his Gender studies class and came out with a whole different perspective on society and my place in it. The course was very informational heavy, but if you just show up to class and study a little you'll be fine.",1
"A very funny professor who wants the best for his students. If you do not understand what he said in lectures, you could always go to his office hours, and his practice tests are almost exactly like the real ones.",1
ten out of ten would never take a class with her again. she prides herself on failing pretty much every student on their first essay and takes forever to hand back the essays. she can be very rude and tough on students by calling them out and then humiliating them. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS UNLESS IT IS REQUIRED FOR YOUR MAJOR.,0
"Just a few notes: On ""Five and Apply"" papers, follow his example EXACTLY, as if it's a template. Seriously. Even if he says it's an ""anonymous"" discussion, use your name. He won't give you credit for the assignment if your name is not attached. Follow his directions EXACTLY and you should get a good grade. No late work!",1
"Professor Draper is a brilliant instructor; lectures are straightforward and enlightening. Shes also a very warm person; she is willing to work individually with students to help them achieve their goals. Clear communication of expectations and transparent grading. Environmental law, policy, and society course was awesome! Definitely recommended.",1
"He's (more than) a little crazy, but definitely knows what he is talking about. If you put in any effort, the class is pretty straightforward. Midterms pulled straight from the homeworks with different numbers.",1
If you peek through his office blinds you can see that he wears a ten gallon hat when nobody else is around. Loves to talk about arduinos and arduino accessories,1
"Gives very detailed and insightful lectures that really allow you to grasp the content as well as the texts. Midterm required you to recall smaller details, but it was open book and quite easy if you took good notes. Tutorials had regular pop quizzes but they are not difficult if you have read the texts.",1
Dr. Kennedy was by far the best professor I've had. I was never a fan of chemistry but he honestly made learning organic chemistry very easy and fun. His knowledge and enthusiasm for the subject was astonishing. He's an awesome guy and will help you at all costs. HIGHLY recommend taking organic with him hes amazing and so helpful.,1
Literally the worst class I've taken at WCSU. Her grading system is a bust. She is a hard grader & makes you redo your work over & over again. Even meeting with her over Webex is a bust as she just tells you if you don't understand the work then settle for a lower grade. Would never recommend her. This class will end up giving you endless stress.,0
Her summer online course was a lot of work. Multiple quizzes a week and a ton to read but if you get it done you will be ok. Definitely will make you work for a good grade but the course over all wasnt too hard.,1
"He is an opinionated professor yet very educated sometimes goes on tangents during lectures, and lectures are long sometimes hard to follow since so much information is thrown at you. Do not miss the dinner study sessions with him he goes over the whole study guide step by step until you understand right before the exam so it is fresh in your mind.",1
Not only does he not curve but a 90% is a B+; how messed up is that? His grading scale actually makes it harder to get an A.  All of the other science classes I have taken have either the normal grading scale or they make an A 87% and above then scale off of that. He is not interested in seeing his students do well.,0
"Super awesome teacher! If you struggle with math, I'd highly recommend her. She's on top of everything, very organized. She gives super detailed notes and will always answer any questions. Just make sure you're able to print the worksheets and lecture notes. Homework is due day of the test, participation credit.",1
"The best professor I have ever had. Cares for her students and wants to see them succeed. Easy homework and classwork, even has option for extra credit. She is so funny and caring and such a real person. Makes the class feel like more of a discussion than lecture.",1
"Ortiz is amazing. He really teaches the course in a way that works best for the class. He's very laid back and teaches you how to say what you mean and mean what you say. He seems grouchy at first, but at the end of the day, he really cares for his students. He's a ""tough love"" kind of guy.",1
He is an awesome professor! Nice and extremely fair!,1
"He is very good professor, and he helps the students, it was a DL class he replies the emails and answers the questions, the exams are not easy buy not very hard",1
"Dr. Mark was an interesting professor but she cares about her students. Class was so easy. She gives a review for each test/final that help A LOT! I ended up with a 99 in the class because she has so many participation grades, quiz grades (rly easy), yellowdig grades, and then the group deliverables (not hard but takes long). Lots of extra credit!",1
"If you are looking for an intro to sociology professor, she is the one. She is very relatable and is willing to help you succeed. She is very caring and is good at teaching this class. No question best professor for the sociology department.",1
"Dr. Topsakal motivates students to expand their education with tailored class projects and project based home works. The time and dedication he devotes to the students is unparalleled. His classes are by far the best experience you're going to get at VCU Engineering. If you haven't had a course with this professor yet, I encourage you to look.",1
"I had Prof. Zeman for A&P 1. I was so nervous to take this class since I heard how hard it is. BEST PROFESSOR!! She breaks everything down so you really understand the topics. She gives you slides and study that and listen in class, you'll be good. If only she was teaching A&P 2... I'd without a doubt take her again. You actually learn too!",1
"You must go to class and listen to his lengthy lectures to pass. You will have 1-2 quizzes every single class, no doubt. Seems easy at first if you do well on the quizzes, then you take the all written test and realize he is the hardest grader ever. He expects the work of a level 400 class. TESTS and FINAL ARE EXTREMELY HARD.",1
"If you can handle being totally on your own with minimal feedback and minimal directions, this course is for you. Professor was fair in grading and she does respond to emails to clarify brief directions on big assignments. Follow her templates as instructed and you will not go wrong.",1
"Not helpful, only class I have ever failed, I got migraines because of this class! Awful! ",0
"Prof. Krutz is fantastic. He's able to communicate very well to the other students - with a nice mix of humor - and knows not only what he's teaching, but how to convey it to the students. It's a shame my only experience with him thus far is Freshman Seminar - I'd imagine having a more robust class with him would be much more fulfilling overall.",1
"For crime mapping, it starts off slow then gets better. Then when you come in, he hand feeds you steps and instructions on how to do the computer assignments",1
"The quizzes give you 90 seconds to complete each question and if you start a discussion she will grade it right away. Discussions are graded as soon as you submit your post, I lost most of my points when she graded the assignment 5 days before the due date and hadn't responded to other people yet and she refused to change it on the due date",0
"This man has his head in perfect alignment of what needs to happen. If you do your work and actually try, you will pass. You will not get sympathy for your lack of work. He's a catch though!",1
"This class reminds me of high school. It's so straight forward and required the minimum amount of work and effort. Professor Suggs is a cool guy and is really passionate about the topic, but I couldn't help but zone out anyway. 100% recommend taking for a gen-ed. Easy A.",1
"Nicasio is a great professor but has high expectations. There is a long reading assignment to do for each class, and a pop quiz can be given at any time. If you miss a class for any reason, five points are deducted from your attendance and participation grade. That said, he's approachable and isn't a tough grader if you put in the required effort.",1
"Dr. Parker was always available to read through our drafts, gave consistent feedback, and was not terribly difficult to please (all you have to do is follow the directions and ask questions).",1
Dr. Knox is AMAZING! So fun to listen to and has great stories. The tests are difficult but can be taken online and he gives you two weeks to complete them. The attendance is mandatory which is what hurt my grade. The TA takes attendance even though its a class of 250... so stupid. I am taking Dr. Knox again next semester for Human Sexuality.,1
"She is a good and incredible teacher, she is very weird but cool and good person at the same time. You would love her.",1
"Professor Linda, is such a great professor. I really enjoy having her class. If you do not understand something, she will definitely take the time out to help you, and she is very understanding. I just love her, the best prfessor at Community College of Philadelphia.",1
"Brilliant to be sure, but very set in his own opinions.  Rough grader--never quite sure what he was looking for.  Will give you a unique outlook on literature though.  Tries to be really intimidating.",1
"Professor Nelson is seriously the best chemistry teacher I have EVER had! He is just amazing! He is very organized,very helpful, and does anything he can for his students. He actually cares! I am so lucky to have had him as a professor. I learned and actually retained the information! I would recommend him to everyone!Take his Lab as well very fun!",1
"Professor Bronie's course definitely kept me on my toes. She's a tough a grader but only because she wants you to succeed in math. All of her exams are cumulative. I missed a few days here and there and it definitely set me back. I would take this class if you want to strengthen our math skills. Overall, she's a great professor.",1
She's okay. She tries her best but doesn't really do a good job overall in her teaching.,1
"Professor Niu is a very nice teacher.  She cares students feelings.  She is very patient and friendly.  When you have any dont understand math questions you can ask her any time,  she will answer you.  For me, this class is very easy.  Homework, you can hand it in any time, but at less before the final.   May this information can help you.",1
"His class was one of the most difficult I've taken. He's pretty strict about cellphone usage and even going to the bathroom. He will literally stop class to ask you where you're going if you get up to use the restroom. I really just was not into his class, but it might be easier if you enjoy political topics or history.",1
"Quizzes/test straight from the powerpoints. Didn't need them, though. However... case studies suck, are different from text problems, and don't expect her nor the TA to help, either. She never helped in discussions or private email. I guess she expects the online students to automatically understand the studies, which are 18 points of final grade.",0
Overall the class was easy. Professor Acosta goes over each problem step by step and goes over any formulas (if needed). She also makes sure that everyone is understanding the work and goes over the homework at the end of class; which is online. She allows an index card on the final and midterm which was really helpful! We didn't use the textbook.,1
Dr. Peruyera is by far one of the best professors I've had in Miami-Dade. He is very clear when teaching and gives a lot of life examples that help you with your tests. He truly cares about his students and will go out of his way to help his students succeed in his class. I truly recommend him.,1
This class is a lot of writing which is expected since it's a writing course. My experience wasn't very good. Class was pretty boring and she will lecture for the entire 2 1/2 hours of we're not watching a film. Memorization of poems and stories. Goes over a lot of material each class so comes to class!! Quizzes almost ever class. Grades harshly!  ,1
"I love marketing but he made me not like it. everything is from the text book, and his classes are NOT engaging what so ever. I've attended to this other Mark lee's class, and his classes are much more engaging, and he makes sure you fully understand each concept learned that day. DEF Take  LEE over CLEVELAND! LEE made me like MKT again.",1
"The class is largely based on a group project (interviews). Tests are very easy! He does not assign any homework outside of the group project material. Really nice guy, tries his best to help everyone to pass!",1
Great professor if you are good at test taking. Lecture heavy. No HW or projects. We were solely graded on attendance and 3 exams. If you dont do well on tests try a professor that has more graded materials here its just 3 exams &showing up.,1
Dr. Battisti is a devoted professor with passion for teaching and for her students.  Be prepared to read in order to participate in class discussions but it is worth is as the topics are engaging.  Feedback on papers is fair and honest which I enjoyed.  If you have a chance to take a course with her do so!,1
Excellent professor! Take her class. You will be very happy.,1
"David is great!! He makes the class very interesting by allowing you to write about what you are interested in. He uses a grading contract, so essentially if you turn in all assignments and put effort into them you will get an A. The class focuses on current issues and his perspective is more liberal, so decide whether that's for you.",1
"THIS PROFESSOR CHANGED MY LIFE!! He is amazing. That class was so interesting- i actually looked forward to going to class. I did not do any of the assigned readings, rather i paid attention during lecture and I have an A+ in the class. it is not an easy class unless you pay attention(luckily, he's intriguing). I will miss this class.",1
"Dr. Strait is a good professor. The class itself bored me to death, but it's an easy A. He is really passionate about what he does and is really understanding if something comes up and you need more time for the tests & quizzes. All of them are online, and he drops 3 of the 6 quizzes and 1 of the 3 tests, which makes it nearly impossible to fail.",1
"Dr. K is always there for her students. She is tough and makes you work, but you won't regret it. ",1
An easy A. I did learn a lot and he is sometimes hard to understand. Overall a great class to take,1
The class was boring if you dont like the course. He is boring. Class is mandatory. Gives you a week to turn everything in. Not that bad. Just boring. I passed with an A.,0
I took this prof for a second time because I thought he was so good.  He does seem more committed to the class this time.  It seems like he is getting harder for the specialization HR classes.,1
"Nice guy, replies to emails, and is pretty lenient with assignments. He practically gives you the answers for the midterm and final, and if you do the assignments it's an easy A. However the lectures are incredibly boring. He reads his PowerPoint slides word for word and it's obvious he doesn't know how to teach, result: didn't actually learn much.",0
"I had Tokunaga-sensei for both 110 and 120. The class isn't that hard, there's no reason you shouldn't be able to keep up. She's nice. Never in a bad mood. It was a pleasure to be in her class this year. arigatou gozaimasu!",1
"Sanchez is really nice and teaches alot of interesting material but in the end, you'll feel as if you've learned nothing. This course doesn't help at all with speaking of the language. Tests are a joke. They're online and basically a google scavenger hunt with a time limit. Grades pretty fairly but takes forever in doing so.",0
Crazy and energetic. Loves what he does. Explains everything out. Study guide has most of the test questions.,1
She is one of my favorite professors that I have ever had the joy of taking a class from.,1
"English 201 is a literature survey course, so it's no surprise that there is an exceptional amount of reading. Overall, this professor was fair if you made effort in the classroom. This was not an easy A, but I found that this class was very enjoyable and worth it! Very interetsing professor and no lectures really-lots of class discussions.",1
"His notes are lack of examples, even some of them are not completed. Most of the content are definition and hard to understand. the assignments are so tough without a clear definition list or a lot of examples. he is not a good choice for math classes.",0
Dr. Dorsett is an extremely funny person and her class is never boring! Her work is no where near easy so you really have to study and pay attention but overall I enjoyed her and her class!,1
0310 2012. I will not sit here and say she is a terrible teacher but I will say her are methods are unreasonable she goes over two chapters a day and will not repeat them also the math labs that are required to have lab for we never go but are expected to have them completed along with home work on test day also if she wont give review for tests,1
"I do appreciate how he has great experience in international business, and it shows, but that's all he talks about. Himself. The stories are real world applications and that's great, but when it comes to midterm and final time, you have to teach yourself everything he did not have time to cover as he talked about himself all class.",0
Awesome class! Very interesting. Enjoyed every minute. Must take class.,1
This class was okay. I really enjoyed it . The only thing is that there are lots of assignments if taken online. But overall is an easy course.,1
"Awesome guy.  Interesting, funny, and of course, very knowledgable.",1
"Dr. Kostopoulos is a great instructor. Participate in the conference activities and submit your papers on time ( he is flexible if you are not on time but communicate with him), you will get a good grade. Make sure you post useful entries in the conference.",1
"The class was OK.  He was super easy and always seemed to be thinking of other things, super preoccupied. Overall I recommend his class if you want a super easy A.",0
"She expected you to know everything, but taught you nothing. Lovely lady, but terrible professor. Avoid her at all costs unless you want your GPA to drop!",0
"You learn more in your sleep than you do in this class. This man doesn't know what is on his homework, and can barely do it. Expect to correct him at least three times a class on how to do middle school algebra. Spends most the lecture telling you how the equation originated and not how to do the homework.",0
"Dr. Bona was one of the best chemistry professors I've ever had. During my semester we were able to use a periodic table with notes written on it for all of our exams, including the final. Our final exam grade could replace our worst score (if it was higher than exams). She explains topics well, and makes chemistry somewhat fun. 10/10 recommend.",1
"This is literally the hardest class I have ever taken in my life (seriously beware), but Paul Young is such a fantastic person and professor. He cares so deeply about his students and is so accommodating. GO TO HIS OFFICE HOURS! He will sit with you and work through every issue you have with papers/tests/concepts for hours. Take a class with him.",1
He goes very quickly in lecture but will stop to address any questions or problem areas. He is kind of awkward but has good math jokes. All test questions come from the review questions he gives you from the textbook so there is no reason you shouldnt know something thats on the test. He gives a nice curve that benefits the people at the top.,1
"I am not sure why there are negative reviews, I absolutely adore this professor. Of all my classes she gives the smallest amount of reading, goes over everything in class, provides slides, very clear of her expectations. Tests are on what she says they are on. There are no surprises. Would take her again!",1
Love his extra credit questions this mans hilarious. Always on time and knows answers that you ask him.,1
"The most understanding teacher at PSC. Although, there was no lectures for this class, he would help in anyway he could. I would recommend him to anyone.",1
"Peter is a nice guy, but his class taught me nothing. Very focused on sewing and design, but did not really teach us how to sew. Taught us the bare minimum to code, still didn't understand. The way he explained things was very confusing and never answered his email. If you asked me to code now I couldn't do anything basic. Nice grader tho.",0
Mr. Ross is an amazing professor. He is very accesible during office hours and at answering emails. He explains content very well and cares about his students. Extra credit on exams. Homework can be long and tedious but that is just the nature of the course. If effort is given you will get an A or B.,1
Professor Kolluru is SO KIND and HELPFUL! She WILL work with you if you speak up and express that you are having difficulty with the material. She is sometimes late with her email responses but just remind her in person that you sent her something. She WILL make time to meet with you during her office hours and will stay until the last hour!,1
Do NOT take his class unless you are looking to be stressed and fail. I am a hardworking student and complete all my assignments yet that doesn't seem to matter. He yells at you or makes a sarcastic remark if you ask a question even when you go to his office hours he makes you feel dumb too. Just do yourself a favor and don't take him!!,0
"Best art teacher I have ever had. She's not a pushover when it comes to grading and she makes you work for results. Christina's goal is to teach each student how they can become a more effective artist, while staying true to the individual's style. She's cool as a cucumber and knows her stuff. If you're not careful you might learn a thing or two.",1
Jacki is an awesome professor. She wants her students to be successful and take something away from her class. History of Economic Doctrine was extremely interesting and she helps you understand its importance in overall economic theory and practice.,1
Absolutely love her! I have never enjoyed an English class until now. Be ready to participate in lecture but Dr. Bland is the best prof I have EVER had. 10/10 a queen I am genuinely sad that I wont have her anymore. If you ever get the opportunity to take her class DO IT!,1
"ce prof la est malade je vous le conseille vraiment, tres exigeant avec ses eleves mais c'est pour votre bien passe sa vie à aider les etudiants par courriel si vous avez besoin! il est marier haha:P",1
Do not take this professor unless you want to teach yourself everything. He yells during a four hour lecture and is honestly not very nice,0
"I would highly recommend this class if you enjoy putting in quality work and do not mind getting a grade that reflects otherwise. She is a nice professor/person, but her grading is subjective. Her guidelines for essays/homework assignments are arbitrary. It is ashame that she grades in this manner because I liked the class, but became discouraged.",1
"Honors class, must have book. lots of reading in class, very engaging. energetic! love her. Only take if you are willing to learn. I see her a lot in the halls, she will say hello to you, even 2 years later. Very friendly. Recommend her!",1
"Great professor, he is a chilled guy and very nice and caring to students! I like the way he lectures. If you are not focused you still can understand what he is talking about! There is a book about critical thinking and a novel which is not bad to read! Essays aren't bad just keep it at the minimum. Overall take him",1
Lectures are really dry but you're forced to sit through them bc of the daily quiz. And there's no room for partial credit on the quizzes or tests so it's an all or nothing situation. Expect to put in a lot of hours if you're not good at probability concepts. Don't skimp on the hws and actually learn from them since they're super helpful for tests.,0
She gave good feedback and connected with her students. I hate english but she helped push me forward,1
Professor Hargett wants her students to succeed. She provides so much feedback to our discussions and assignments. I will definitely search for her in the future to guarantee a spot in her class. She goes beyond in my mind what is normal for a professor to engage with students,1
In comparison to other nursing schools they show ya how to do the skill one on one till ya get it right and ya know exactly what they want. If ya don't have prior exp then yer behind the 8 ball to perform those psycho-motor skills. That's one factor that makes it harder at COC. BTW this prof has been nicer recently.,1
"Great class to take. Not difficult b/c you get all the help you need. Office hours are helpful, presentations  are sent to email, forums, exams are straight forward from HW and class. He explains things very clearly. only downside is he will often answer important Qs before class start time and will many times finish after end time of class.",1
"I am going to school to become an actor and this woman is the best instructor I have ever had. She is full of life and passion. She is always there for us, she pushes us, and encourages us to give 100% at all times. Not to mention, she is one of the most inspiring people I've ever met as well. Honestly, one couldn't ask for a better teacher!",1
"Really nice guy, funny, but frustrating if youre accustomed to more organized & punctual teachers. No HW but that does mean your grade is basically based on tests. Feels weird spending hrs on labs you dont even turn in for credit. Stalls on getting graded work back due to being busy w day job, but its a night class, most of us work FT too.",1
Professor List was amazing. I wish he could teach all of my classes. He is very patient and super funny.,1
"Jamie is unlike most professors at UVM, she is very cut-and-dry, to the point and will cut you off if the questioncomment does not have to do with the in-class discussion. She does this for a reason because there's so much material to cover in only 15 classes. I liked the way she lectured and she's very fair with grading. overall, A-",1
do not recommend,0
Dr. G's entomology class was the most enjoyable class I ever took at Centre. He is super passionate and is very caring and fun to work with. His classes are very lecture-heavy but he posts the power points on Moodle and hosts review sessions before exams. Highly recommend him as a professor and HIGHLY recommend his entomology class!,1
"Worst professor I've ever taken ever in my history of math professors. She is an introvert, which I did take into factor, but she cannot teach the subject whatsoever. Skims through the guided notes, if she doesn't like a part of the notes she skips it and her tests are worded so you cant understand them. Don't take unless you want to teach urself.",0
Take him! His class is easy and understanding. While it's easy you still learn and he doesn't give unbearable work at all. He is understanding when it comes to situations and he understands that people have a life outside of school. He's an easy grader and he wants you to pass. Take him and you won't regret him! It's my first semester too @ SPS!,1
An absolute waste of time.  Do yourself a huge favor and drop whatever class you're taking with him and wait until someone else teaches it.,0
Professor Gibbons was great for intro IR! Readings were long and dense but she made everything simple in lecture. Very interesting and handled the big class size well. Easy grader- the 2 exams and 2 papers were both straightforward. Helpful with papers in office hours. Very sweet and smart woman.,1
"I had Dr. Longworth for her 2nd semester teaching and it really showed. She seemed unsure of herself a lot throughout the lectures, but she got better as the semester wore on. The exams are heavily curved (the top 50% of the class gets at least a B). You must read if you want an A and you need to understand the concepts along w/ the physics.",1
what the other guy said,1
Hes so hot its a pleasure being in his class for that only. Butt;) he is also the only teacher in the HRM course. The other are a waste of time and a shame to the profession. This guy is a true teacher. Thanks!!!,1
"I took Activism, Participation, and Protest with Professor Alvarez and I have to say that I am not impressed. I think she lets her personal political opinions get in the way. Her ""lectures"" are confusing and there are way too many group collaborations on the readings. (There are SO many readings). She's a smart person, though, which is nice to see.",0
"One of the hardest professors I've taken for bio, he doesn't respond to emails, he doesn't help when you ask questions, he shows a lot of attitude if you ask him something, he's a harsh grader, picks on certain students and he gives pop quizzes, he gets mad when you struggle to pronounce a certain word instead of helping you.",0
"LOVE HIM! Is passionate about the material, and the weekly quizzes were a great way to boost marks. His lectures are easy to understand and he is very accessible if you have questions and concerns. I would recommend this class to anyone even if you are just taking it to fulfil a core.",1
"Lacking of  example, the assignment is nothing about the notes. He talked a lot about the definition. the definition is useless. He thought he is a good teacher, you know....",0
This class was kind of boring at times and all notes. Tara is very nice though. There is one paper and a few projects but nothing too bad. If you do the work you'll probably get an A. The tests are on the notes so if you study you'll pass. I would recommend her.,1
"Decent class for those with little to know experience in web development. Briefly covers all aspects of web like HTML/CSS, basic JavaScript, databases, and deployment techniques. If you already have a decent knowledge in web, you will find yourself extremely bored however. Krutz makes the class very fun, however his grading can be a little vague.",1
Hes mean makes you feel dumb if you answer questions wrong or if you ask a question. Do nit take his class,0
She was really nice. She would go over problems a few times if that is what it took. ,1
"Mary is extremely passionate about archaeology, why else would she still be lecturing? She doesn't post the figures from her lecture slides, so go to class and take pics! If you do that and just listen to her, take decent notes and ask questions, you'll do well on the exams. She's unfairly maligned by students who underperform, I've seen it.",1
"She is way too harsh a grader. She gives assignments for projects and papers, but does not give you any structure for them, just ""do this"". Then she tells you that you did the assignment wrong. I would not recommend her.",0
Easily the worst professor I've had at UK. Don't bother asking him a question in class because it's a guarantee he will miss it and a student will have to correct him. And he does very little explaining how he gets his answers. Would not recommend,0
No Comments,1
"Great teacher and nice person. Readings can be a bit existential and hard to understand, but grading is not too hard.",1
"Had Dr.K as a lab professor, and he's great. You can tell he really enjoys what he does. Explains everything thoroughly and is very patient. His tests are not difficult if you show up and go over the PowerPoint slides he posts on blackboard. Highly recommended if you need to take microbiology.",1
"Ms. Mahon is amazing, super genuine and sweet. She is insanely helpful and wants you to not only pass her class but actually get a good grade. She gives multiple practice quizzes and tests before the real thing and gives study guides that she makes the tests from. would absolutely recommend taking a class with her!",1
"You will learn more about colonization from reading Bartolome de las Casas' ""Brief Account of the Devastation of the Indies,"" than you will from this entire class. He spends about 90% of the time justifying the European colonizers and how it wasn't that bad. Only refers to native/aboriginal/indigenous people as ""Indians."" Calls slaves ""workers.""",0
She is amazing,1
"If you ever get a chance to take academic success with Caitlyn, do it. She's extremely caring, inspirational, and funny. She truly wants you to succeed in academia and in life. She's extremely approachable and walks you through everything. Small groups were fun. Definitely an instructor who has impacted my UofM experience. Highly recommend!!",1
I really liked Professor Marks. Homework and basically everything comes from the packet he assigns. He returns grades quickly and encourages you to come talk to him about any problems you have. Excellent teacher.,1
"This class is very interesting but dont sign up unless you are ready to go to every single class. You get 10 points off your attendance grade every time you miss a class, which counts as a test grade. and 10 points off if youre caught on your phone. the lectures are very interesting though and always have guest speakers. tests you can find online",1
Kevin is a great professor and I would recomend him if you are looking for easy credits!,1
"Jerry grades promptly, tests were not overly difficult.  I would highly recommend taking him for Business Law I. ",1
"Jeri is amazing. This is her first year back teaching after being head of he department, and I am SO glad I got her!! Class is easy, she knows how to grade art (very fairly) and projects are pretty wide open. Oh, and she loves (LOVES) her sheep :-) I would most definitely take her again!!!",1
"She grades hard but allows you to change your work after she comments, so it is kinda easy to get a good grade if you work at it. Lots of reading!!!!",1
"Super easy class but boringggg. We watched a video and took a reading quiz every other week, but they were all really easy. He tends to talk about the same thing forever, but for the most part he's a fine professor.",1
Actually said maybe statistics just isnt your thing after i went to his office hours to question the amount of points he took off for small math errors.,0
She really teaches you to design and pushed your natural creativity. It is a shame many students try and take advantage of her supportive and kind nature. She doesn't let them get away with it thought! A gem to MU.,1
"Amazing professor. I had her for Clinical Anatomy in the school's DPT program. Her knowledge is extensive and even at this level, she is able to relay the information in a manner for all to understand. Very dedicated to her students' learning.",1
I had Dr. Sam for lab and he is a decent teacher. He has a heavy accent and his lectures are boring but he he knows his stuff and lets you know what is important for the practical. If you study the textbook and the photos online attendance isn't really mandatory.,1
Conta was an amazing professor when I attended class with him back in 2011-2013. Great to see an actual police officer become a professor and have such vast work knowledge/experience but also incorporate it into a lecture format and be able to teach students. I took pretty much all the courses he offered and left LACC with an AA in Criminal Justice,1
"He's a nice guy but his lectures are just not interesting. He doesn't make much of an effort as a teacher to keep the class interested. He gives online quizzes spontaneously and they're sometimes assigned at the last minute when they do take a bit of time to do because they are difficult. He does give a little bit of extra credit, nothing too big.",0
He is a fast teacher and can be difficult to follow in class. He can make simple concepts more complicated than they seem. I had a tutor I met with three times a week and still got consistent Cs and Ds on tests. The quizzes are helpful but his class does not prepare you for his difficult exams.,0
"I've had JPow for three classes. If you attend his class & do the homework, you will learn & do fine in the course. In terms of class structure, you have to turn in completed problem sets every Friday, and the class is lectured-based. There tend to be two mid-term exams and a final exam. Exams hold a heavy-weight so be sure to do well on them!",1
"Prof Birkett is an awesome professor! While I was shy and didn't speak with her, she makes psy255 very enjoyable and easy to learn. I hope to take other classes with her at NAU.",1
GREAT PROF! One Sapling Learning assignment due every week. You had plenty of time to take the tests. One 5 page essay paper. Must attend a couple (3? 4?) SI sessions.,1
"Good professor- very fair. Took a condensed A&P class with him and found his tests and practicals to be on point with what he teaches. If you study, you'll do well. No surprises.",1
The test was irrelevant to both lectures and labs. Try to avoid.,0
Oh Michelle... when you catch her in a good mood she's amazing and totally helpful. Otherwise beware. She is really tough but you do end up learning a lot.,1
"good teacher, she is pretty easy if you just do the work and do all your response papers. She lets you make up essays if you get a C or lower so that's cool. The objective finals are easy, only hard part is the final essay. good luck!",1
"During the online covid semester, Laura was my most accommodating professor towards students. She was pretty lenient and understanding with deadlines. This was truly an interesting course and there were many areas to earn easy points in.",1
I took Prof. Zeman for A&P I and Microbiology she is a wonderful professor. She is very nice and extremely helpful. She makes everything clear. Her test are not that difficult as long as you study you will get a good grade. Her exams also have extra credit available. I definitely recommend her!,1
Dr. K is a great insructor.I wish all of my other professors would utilize his teaching techniques. Dr. K got you to think about the class and responded to all classmates postings.,1
Dr. Z is very knowledgeable and her lectures are a lot of fun. She tries to engage students with dialogues and jokes to make anatomy less tedious.,1
Kathy was a great prof. She gives lots of extra credit opportunities and is such a kind woman. JRN 101 was super easy and interesting. She does do pop quizzes every now and then so make sure you're prepared for those. I absolutely loved this class.,1
"If you want to learn how to write a research paper for upper-level courses, I suggest you take her course. It was tough for me to say on top of my work because it was mostly online but there were clear rubrics so I got an A in the class and learned how to write a research paper. Don't slack and speak up if you're confused and you'll be fine!",1
"I registered for this class to be taken on campus but COVID hit and turned it into an online class. I was VERY nervous, but she is a great caring teacher. She provides all the tools needed to learn and actually grasp the work. I definitely recommend her!",1
"He's as good a choice as any. The guy knows his stuff but students think otherwise because he's disorganized in class. He drops one test (or your quiz total), and all his exams are well within the homework territory. As long as you do your homework yourself you should be fine.",1
Good Professor.,1
"Omgg I love my professor soo much, She is the best teacher for math, she explain so well. I just to hate math, but now I enjoy so much math thanks to her.",1
"His lectures are long, maybe because of his monotone voice? But honestly do the homework, follow along, and he's very helpful during office hours. He also curves grades and gives extra credit for the final.",1
"Hellmann is a wonderful and caring teacher. She is also Deaf! You may think it would be challenging, but working with someone who is patient like her, there is no language barrier between her and students. Her patience is greatly appreciated. Make sure you also practice signing out of class. If you show the effort it will be noticed!",1
"Extremely boring class and the way he lectures makes it even more boring, the guy can never stay on topic and talks about research half of the time. Tests were ridiculous cuz theyre on stuff he says and very boring to listen to. Im changing my major. they need a guy who can stay on topic and make the class more bareable. Did i mention its boring?",0
I love Ms Lupton she is an awesome music teacher,1
"Professor Fierle is a great professor. She teaches Therapeutic Recreation for people with Disabilities. During the Winter semester, we learned a lot from the elderly to children at risk. This class is a continuation of RPE 3100",1
She's so nice and extremely helpful. She likes conversation and is very engaging as well. She also brings food every class. Assignments are essays which are not hard topics and at the end you can pick which three you like the best and turn it in. Only thing that I hated was MyLabsPlus. She's pretty lenient with it though.,1
"Very caring and understanding professor. She always urges students to come in outside of class for help. Overall, a really good professor.",1
I've had her for several classes now and if you put in effort she'll help you in any way possible. If you care then she will and you'll more than likely make an A,1
very easy... you can read the other comments... i did most of the work and study guides myself to make it harder... easy easy A,1
"100 level course, yet we were asked to write 3 page papers weekly.  Course load is heavy, but then the midterm and final are the only time the text book was actually used in the class.  Graded strictly on grammar, and marked down for things that were direct quotes from citations.  I'm now in a 200 level writing course that requires less.",0
"She's not the best lecturer but if you take this class with Physics 1 background, you'll be fine. Make sure to do the homework and any book questions. Reading doesn't help, the book is only useful for additional problems. Conceptual stuff will come from lectures, so make sure to attend them all.",1
I LOVE LOVE LOVE HUG! She is hilarious and very passionate about what she teaches. She relates everything to everyday life which helps with understanding the material. Offers so many extra credit. Participation is good in her class also because  you may get extra credit from it. Total of 4 exams that's it. I totally recommend her! :) ,1
"Nice old guy, really smart. Unfortunately, he can't teach. At all.  He is very helpful on his projects. If you go to him for help don't be surprised if he basically finished it for you. He also might not help you at all (rarity, but happens). If you want a grade, take this guy. If you want to learn, avoid at all costs.",1
He is so easy!!!!!!!!!!!! He cancels class majority of the time. You are guaranteed an A.,1
Lectures heavy but 80% of the exams are the study guide word for word multiple choice. Book was never used so do not buy. Lab manual is needed no matter what. Labs are super easy just long. Leonard is one of the professors who is relatable af. Take him if you need the GE and get to know him. Drops both lowest lab/lecture exams. AVOID LANG 4 LABPROF,1
Riley was nice. He gave a few extra credit for students who missed a test but anyone could turn in the extra credit. He always gave the questions for short answers weeks before the test. If you ask questions he's always willing to answer. I would take him for every bio class if i could !,1
I took two sessions of her class and they were both two of the most exciting classes I have ever taken in my life!!  Linda Besemer is a Genius and extremely generous with her time and patience.,1
"She's a sweet lady - well described by someone earlier as resembling Ms. Honey from Matilda...she posts printable lecture notes that breaks down book material very well. She wants her students to do well.Clicker questions make class mandatory, but help on tests. Do the online hw, come to class, and do the study guide before exams and you're golden.",1
"The online quizzes should have been true/false & multiple choice only; if typed answers are going to be required then just give us the quizzes in class or as a midterm. Make sure you do the readings, even though the textbook is optional, and go over all the notes before every quiz. Be as clear as possible on the take home, easy to lose marks there.",1
Cares about students and funny stories,1
"I thought that the class was okay. Not super interesting, but not super hard either. Dave Barker is very helpful and he is willing to give personal help to his students when they need it.",1
"You'll pass if you can stand being berated in front of the class, can self teach or at least read his mind since he'll never be clear. I cried so many times because of this class & not cause I don't work hard, but cause he expected award winning films w/out teaching anything. Had his ""caring"" days but mostly made sure to crap on us for something.",0
"Dr yang puts a lot of work into instruction. That being said she also makes you fill in the gaps. No dry memorizartion, you must control your learning with lectures as a guide. Tests are straightforward and lectures are dry",1
BEST PROF. easy marker. gives easy extra marks. hilarious. explain everything thoroughly. engages with the class and makes it fun,1
"Worst Professor at NJIT.  I am looking to get him booted.  He never changes his slides, his accent is heavy, he is confused himself when he talks, his exams are confusing and do not correlate to what he teaches, he responds 2 days later too questions, the structure of his class sucks, bad textbook selection, overall he needs a major makeover.",0
He is so nice and easy to talk to if i had any problems. the best english teacher i ever had,1
"Take her and take her online!!!! Easy A! Don't think because it is math and online it will be hard. It was not a hard course and I enjoyed it a lot. Discussion board post are 4 a week, and homework involves 5-10 questions each week, and 3 tests. She exempts the final if you have an 88%",1
"Do not take his class. It is literally the worst. You can try as hard as you can to make your work look good, and he will still find something completely wrong with it.",0
Great professor!!,1
"I wrote down most things that woman said, and typed them up and saved them to disk...as her insight, experience and honesty will be tools to use not only in my professional life, but in my personal, emotional and spiritual. Three cheers for Judith!",1
Hes alright but his quizzes and projects do little to no boost to your grade and small assignments affect most of the whole grade. The dates for assignments are confusing. Expects you to know when things are due when there was little to no mention to them in class.,0
"Hes the best! I would totally take him again! He talks a lot, so make sure you get everything down. His test arent hard but they are long. But he gives a lot of extra credit.",1
I took Eng 1b online and I had a good experience. You definitely need to put in the work to earn your grade but if youre willing to do so and attend office hours for extra help I would recommend the class. Lots of essays and readings but final project was fun.,1
Mean,0
"He gives 300 question study guides for a 50 question test and you basically have to memorize every single question. Three exams and one final note test. The class is structured very weird, lectures and then go home and teach yourself the material from the textbook. I should have dropped this class when I had a chance.",0
"The best teacher ever, a genius in the subject. totally grateful for his classes. my phd will benefit immensely from the high ethical and academic standards set by Professor Berkson.",1
"I enjoyed having Professor fields because she was approachable, but she didnt get back to me on a few emails (or took 3 days). The class was kind of difficult, honestly. Reading the chapters was a breeze and the information wasnt hard to grasp, but the homework assignments and tests were pretty difficult. I barely got an A and had to work HARD.",1
Ok.. He is a nice guy..good musician..easy class..funny and younger so its easy to get along with him.. BUT he totally favors his type of music over anything else And gives more opportunities and chances and is more helpful to bands who play his kind of music which i dont think is fair. He also apparantly has something against people who just sing.,1
"Quite a bit of reading outside of class, but she does a really good job of picking readings that will spark your interest. She is also a tough grader when it comes to papers, but is super willing to work with you on them if you go visit her office hours. One of my favorite classes I have taken at GU!",1
"Bush is interesting. His lectures at first are captivating but then he gets boring over the semester. He does not cold call. Stopped reading halfway through the semester because its all about practicing his crazy questions. Must learn to write in ""short form."" Final is open notes. Get a good outline.",1
Boring but good professor. He sends you the notes over everything on your email.,1
Simply the best nursing instructer I've ever had! Professor waller cares about her students and wants them to succeed. She's so good at explaining things that we thought the material was much easier than it really was! It was an absolute pleasure to be in her class. You'd be really lucky to have her. She made nursing school enjoyable!,1
I suggest switching out of his class ASAP if you're not a quick learner. Mr. Bannow will expect you to know things he vaguely goes over (like the math portions of chapters). Be ready to teach yourself or hire a semester long tutor or you WILL be lost. He will get angry/frustrated if you have any questions. Most impatient teacher I've ever met.,0
She is very a harsh grader and rarely gives A's. However she is very nice.,0
He is an old school prof - his lectures are all talk with minimal overhead slides. He talks at a reasonable pace and tends to say the same thing a few different ways so you have time to write down the important stuff. There isn't a topic in econ that this guy doesn't know about. One of the smartest people I've met at U of G.,1
"Awesome Teacher! We got actual time in the studio so we could get our hands on the actual equipment. By the end of the class I knew how to use all the cameras, audio, VTR, etc! It is hard to get an A on your productions but he gives great feedback so you can improve.",1
Very enjoyable class! She does a really great job of making the class interesting while still giving you the tools you need to be successful in the class.,1
I've had this prof twice. the second time for Adolescent lit. She is awesome. you have to write a blurb (1-2 pages) after everything u read but its easy and it makes up most of your grade. she allows you to have your own opinion and is really cool all around. She has great stories too.,1
Professor Webb was an amazing teacher. He makes sure you under the problems before moving on to the next. He relates the problems to real life situations. He gives homework but its only so it prepare you for the quiz.,1
Really enjoyed this class and Ms. V as a professor. Really makes you think outside the box and allows your opinion to be heard and considered.,1
"Great teacher and a fairly fun class. A lot of listening to music and learning a liitle about it. Unlikely to be anything you recognize or would listen to on a daily basis. Over all though, super easy class.",1
"The yoga sessions are great, but she pretty much just reads straight from the readings during lecture.",1
"Learned a great deal.  Applicable to job.  Semester long, difficult group simulation, but did enjoy.  Fantastic Professor.",1
"Classes were kind of boring, but she is a good teacher. Liberal.",1
"Great teacher, class was very interesting and enjoyable. He's laid back and funny, but don't let that fool you, he knows his stuff and grades a little harder than you'd expect.",1
The weekly quizzes are unfair and nothing like the homework. You spend an average of 4 hours on homework a week. She is not a good teacher and doesn't explain the material well. Just a bad teacher. Avoid her unless you can teach yourself accounting and have a lot of free time in your schedule. ,0
"Le cours de Mme Promtep est très intéressant, j'avais toujours envie d'en apprendre plus. Elle m'a fortement inspirée à m'inscrire à la maîtrise en commerce électronique. De plus, elle est toujours disponible pour répondre à nos questions. Le projet final de son cours est pertinent, car il nous permet d'aider une entreprise de façon concrète.",1
Prof. Zeman is one of the best professors I have ever had. If you study her power points you will get 100 on every test. I did and I just followed the power points. She explains everything and if you did not understand it she will explain it again. She is sweet and funny. Do yourself a favor and take her!!!!,1
"Brian is awesome. He is very knowledgeable and really helpful. You have to see 4 plays which can be pricey depending on the ones you choose, but other than that I have no complaints! I highly recommend taking his class. He's a great guy.",1
"Wolverton provides the proper materials to succeed, but only vocally, so attendance is a must, as well as quick note-taking skills. She was condescending when approached during office hours and the tests are very specific. Reading the textbook is necessary, but the Buddha book's a waste. Success is viable, but only if you're willing to work for it.",1
"Annoying, arrogant, and generally not fun to be around.",0
"By a wide margin, the least enthused professor I've ever had. It is difficult to pay attention in this class even though I love biology. No involvement from the class or anything to keep you on your toes. Just do your homework, read the chapters, show up, you'll get an A.",0
"Dr. Pittman is the best English professor I've had at Hagerstown Community College, she's passionate about teaching and passionate about English topics. She really cares about success of her students and respects and cares for you as an individual. I'd recommend anyone take her for ENG-101!",1
"She is such a delightful professor. This was my first class in college after being out of school for almost 8 years. I did not feel overwhelmed and she taught me what skills I need to take with me for future classes. She is friendly, sweet, and knowledgeable.",1
Tavss is an awesome professor. He puts a lot of time and effort into his lectures study guides. Do ALL the practice exam problems he puts online. The study guides practice exams are very helpful and essential to get a good grade. You can skip the book problems (not helpful) and skim the readings but COMPLETE ALL PRACTICE EXAMS ONLINE!,1
"There is no question that Dr. G is the best professor at the University. If you can't handle a heavy workload then simply dont take his classes. If you love the environment like I do, then the workload is no problem. I loved every second of the class, & I look for more classes to take with him every semester. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! (any class by him)",1
"Attendance isn't mandatory, he grades the homework for completeness, he gives credit on exams as long as you put an answer, no extra credit given unless you are borderline with your grade, for example, A/B",1
"Sara's class is one that should be taken with caution. Don't let her humorous attitude fool you into thinking you're going to get an A with ease. She will push you to be your best but at the same time will expect you to have a professional (and ""perfect"" ) approach to everything. Utilize your time wisely and be prepared for a rigorous work load.",0
1 Job search assignment easy and a job search presentation. 3 Test and the 4th one is the final . attendance is for extra credit. course evaluation is for extra credit. He also gives us a question sometimes and we would get extra credit. easy class as long as you take clear notes. everything he discusses in his lectures is important to get an A.,1
"He was very all over the place and hard to follow. However, he is very compassionate and willing to help students pass.",1
She can be very difficult if you do not study. She is a great help outside of class too. She pushes you hard but is an awesome teacher. If you take her class be sure to take lab with her to if you can.,1
"Mrs. Poole is a wonderful teacher. I was skeptical about taking a counseling class, but once I entered Mrs. Poole's class it was so much fun! She is an outstanding teacher and very patient with all types of students. Mrs. Poole is a teacher that actually cares about the students succeeding in college. I would recommend her class to anyone.",1
Very very very unorganized Online Course. I have taken a lot of online classes and this one has to be the worst. way to much homework and not enough time to finish it. I found out early that you'll need to find a Saturday or Sunday before the assignments are do and just do 2 or 3 just in case he decides to change his mind when they are due.,1
"Pretty easy grader. Took her for econ 211. No exams in the class. Grading criteria: weekly discussions posts: 30%, aplia weekly problems: 50%, and research term paper: 20%. She is a excellent and easy teacher. She also teaches econ 210. Take her for both courses.",1
"Based on my experience with Dr. Ayadi this semester, I do not understand the negative reviews. She is very knowledgeable and overall a great professor. Her class is organized and she tries her best to breakdown the  material. There are a few writing assignments but nothing over a page long. I recommend taking her.",1
"Unlike lecture, Professor Thompson is far better in the Lab setting - he appears more comfortable and is more approachable. He makes his own lab book (only $16!) - lab consists of 4 10 question quizzes, 8 labs, 1 practical, and 1 final. Limited point total (only 260) small margin for error as practical and exam are worth 100 pts total.",1
Professor Tavss is the sweetest professor I've ever met. He knows his stuff and gives practice problems that will help you succeed at Chemistry.  He is very approachable and helpful. I highly recommend taking him because  he wants you to do well and you will do well with Tavss.,1
"Prof Zietz is excellent! She really engages students in class and isn't too aggressive on the homework. She is understanding and caring, but also has high expectations for her students. She is fun and keeps the material relatable and interesting! Definitely recommend her!",1
"Funny dude, but thats where the list of positives end as far as his ability as a teacher.  Showing up to class was about as useful as watching bill nye the science guy re-runs. Useless teacher so enjoy learning everything yourself.  Hard tests but he does curve. ",0
I really enjoyed Ms. Thompson's class.  She's a little tough but a great motivator and I had a lot of fun in her aerobics class!,1
"Prof. Uzcategui is passionate about nutrition and health, for sure. Attendance is graded and an app is used to track it, so you have to show up. Her lectures do get really boring at times and I actually fell asleep twice in her class despite never falling asleep in any other classes before. Still, her class is more than fair and I would recommend.",1
"Everything she said during this class was something to take to heart. She's a wonderful teacher and this was my favorite class, the best I think I've ever taken. It's incredibly personal though so if you're not open to sharing some secrets then it might not be for you. Class was understanding as a whole though and felt like a safe place",1
"Super great professor. Class is tough, he expects a lot from you, but it's doable. He makes lectures fun and exciting and really draws you in whether you're a history person or not. I loved his class and plan on taking another with him.",1
Professor Beck was a very good professor and you could tell she really loves what she teaches. She was very nice and helpful during office hours. Exams are can be very difficult and lectures can sometimes be hard to follow but overall she is very sweet and very caring. Just go in and ask questions and get things clarified.,1
"Sign language is a great language, but this Professor makes me question if I should continue with studying it. She has temper tantrums, extremely impatient, and will put down students when they have a genuine inquiry to further their learning. It is taxing having to come to each class and have to feel like you are not good enough for sign language.",0
"He doesn't understand that this is class meant for non-science majors! He teaches it as if you need physics to succed in the world, every class there's a quiz and you have to read the textbook to do well on them but even then the textbook is hard to understand. Goes on tangents a lot and he will always keeps you until class has ended.",0
"If your looking for a great CIS 150 professor this is the one! She is very helpful and answers your questions as soon as she can. She knows a lot about computers and is very knowledgable in about the CIS field. Most of the grader projects she did in lab with us as a class. Homework is easy, lots of extra credit. Overall a great professor & class.",1
"If monotones and boring lectures aren't your cup of tea I wouldn't recommend this professor. He is nice and his classes are interesting but the 3 hours of lecture are hard to stay awake in. Attendance is a must, and there are 2 roll sheets so you can't skip, homework is easy otherwise just be prepared to feel like you're in high school again.",1
"He is a great lecturer who believes on hard work before success. you work for what you you get. I believe you, if you wanna know math, take this lecturer.",1
"I had him for USI, I am taking him again for USII.
 He is a nice guy, very knowledgeable. Two tests, goves a very good review before them so it's easy to study. Current events are good, I wish he did them more. If you study hard and do the small amount of homework you will get a good grade. Only problem was his lectures are boring.",1
"This is the most interesting class I have taken in this program.  A nice blend of health economics and health care policy. Economics is not easy, and requires a lot of studying, but its worth the effort",1
"She was definitely helpful and was not necessarily an easy A, but made it easy to get an A. This class definitely requires studying, but other than that, just do your work. She provides amazing study guides and is very helpful. Also, she offers extra credit that can really save your grade. Highly recommend her.",1
Very clear and easy to follow.,1
"Amazing professor. He really cares about his students. He makes sure everyone is prepared before a speech with clear directions and templates and before test with study guides. Show up to class & participate , you will pass.",1
"He's a very good professor, and there was a lot of useful information in the class.  There is one big group project at the end of the semester, and several individual assignments throughout.   He will help you, but you have to do some work first.  Very accomodating with schedules.",1
"Love this man. Go to class and you will be rewarded. He's not very friendly, but if you do your work you will do well :) .. ps don't be a ""parrot.""",1
What an awesome prof ! Yes she is strict and yes she expects a lot of participation and hard work but her number one goal really seems to help you improve. She gives constructive feedback. She is passionated about the language and will make you feel more self-confident about your sign language abilities :),1
"Dan is the worst professor I've ever dealt with. He told my class that if we died, it wouldn't matter and people would get over it easily. Really disrespectful guy. That said, it was an easy A.",0
"Celia is kind of scary, at first? High expectations, dry humour, and can be intimidating. She grew on me over the term though. I would recommend going to her office hours regularly if you want to do well, and really focusing on ASL structure. Don't overpractice for tests or she'll nail you! When all was signed and done, I came out a better signer.",1
Dr. Hauck is one of the best biology professors. He is super kind and he is very efficient with his lectures. He is very transparent and will let you know what you need to know. Just be a decent student who works hard and he will be awesome,1
"One of the worst professors at PCC. Teaching style is terrible and his notes dont correlate to the homework, quizzes, or tests. From using the equations he has taught us I have figured out that he is a poo poo teacher and that is the only equation I was able to figure out while taking his class. Dont take this class/professor if you want a future",0
"Great professor, easy to work with an a pleasure to be in her class. She is dedicated, responsible and very knowledgeable in her field.",1
"Sara is AMAZING!!  Her Intro to Social Work Class is extremely interesting and she asks review out of the exam, itself!  Brought us breakfast a couple of times, too.  She is a sweetheart.  You have to TRY to fail the course or get a bad grade.  I got an A+.  Make sure you get your volunteer hours in, though.",1
I would recommend Jana. She cares about her students and is very helpful. Always has a smile on her face and an attitude that matches.,1
"Super easy class. I am really bad at math but this prof really helps you out. She curves everything. There are a lot of homeworks and a few quizzes and tests, but she goes over almost exactly the qs that are gonna be on them during review. Do have to buy a code for Pearson which is $$$",1
"I made a huge mistake taking Prf. Smith. She is nasty, sarcastic, doesn't give good feedback on papers, and is very unorganized. I should've stuck with my professor from last semester. Prf. Smith runs her class in an ""my way or no way"" kind of fashion. Do not take her, ever.",0
"She is a hard grader, I wouldnt recommend. Lots of reading",0
"If calc is the highest math youre required to take, he makes it easy by replicating the practice tests. And if math is your focus, he creates lesson plans that are logical and easy to study later if you miss the info in class.",1
Be prepared to stress but good thing is that open book besides on midterm and final.,0
"Dr. Hinton is super sweet and witty. For lectures, it's really boring; she reads off the powerpoint and they're on her moodle too. Her exams questions are often on quizlet and she reviews the class day before the exam day, I recommend recording her with your phone and searching the questions.",1
Dr. Boden is passionate about his work but is terribly inconsistent    comes grading. there are grey ares in geology but he still  grades strictly for  100 level course.  to  this   a community college!   not recommend taking this class. it   gpa  killer! hw is  and long. way too much time   a good grade  an elective class.,0
Useless... inconsistent...unmotivated...ineffective.,0
"Most people don't like Dr. Jones because her class is ridiculously hard. In reality, it's only hard in comparison with Troy's other biology classes. This class weeds out the people who simply don't have what it takes to be a doctor or scientist, and I respect Dr. Jones for having the guts to be the ""bad guy"" in order to prepare us for reality.",1
"Dr. Piland is energetic and interesting to listen to; however, he is sarcastic and doesn't seem to care much for his students.  His tests and quizzes are NOT on what he tells you they will be on, and you will need to memorize all muscle origins, insertions, and actions for his tests.",1
"He starts off as a great prof because of his sense of humor, but his lectures mostly consist of him reading off his power point slides, which is also posted online. He also posts the test questions as a ""review"" and they can be found on quizlet. Honestly, an easy A. He's a super nice and cool dude with an accent.",1
Most awful degrading teacher. Fails students at all opportunities. extremely unclear grading criteria. often does not show up to her own lectures. picks on students for incorrect answers. if you don't participate in class discussions she will call you out on it. clicks her teeth constantly.,0
This man clearly does not use a learning plan to prepare for his lectures. Time and time again he will awkwardly asks questions that have nothing to do with the material and google things for the whole 2 hour period. Sobie is also very unclear about what will be on the exams or quizzes and when they will be. Dont take him!,0
a,0
Mrs. Gray is very knowledgeable and makes the subject easier to understand.,1
Simply put: one of the best professors you will ever have. Take her class !,1
"Love Dr. Record! Really easy class, just show up and participate a couple of times. The group projects can be a pain but if you complete them with effort this class is an easy 4.0",1
"Shauna was a brilliant teacher, but she made you work for it. If you put in the time and the effort, you would do good. But if you skipped and didn't put in the work, your mark reflected that. Oh and she would call you out on it too. ",1
"Yes she's a good teacher and Yes she's very welled prepared, but for some reason her teaching method didn't work with me or other class mates in my class. She teaches the longer way of a problem. And in one calss period she goes through 2 chapters of the book and never repeats it. I had trouble understanding her concept.",1
Don't take orgo II with him if you actually want to learn anything. He forces you to memorize things and his exams don't test your understanding of the material. Also he is so useless at office hours and makes you feel stupid when you go there to get help. Your textbook WILL BE your best friend so be prepared if you plan to take this dude!,0
"really tough grader, extra credit is only worth one point. She is not helpful when you have concerns about your grade and has a very smart way to respond, always. since her english isn't so good, her lectures are not understandable. Do not recommend her.",0
"He's an awesome professor, he's just kinda, the chem professor version of a football coach. He does post his lectures online, but I would suggest being there since sometimes stuff doesn't make it to the online version.",1
"Not as good as people say. I had him this semester, and he was alright. The curve will not help you much, and while he is a good professor, he still has his flaws like everyone else. He comes off as smug/arrogant when you go to ask him questions. His exams are fair, but the averages are always high (as most of the students in his course are honors)",1
This professor was absolutely horrible. All she did during lecture was read her power point slides word for word. As if I can't read them myself. When test time came the answers to the questions could not be found anywhere in the slides or book. She expected you to have a deep understanding of the subject material without teaching it to you.,0
"Worst Professor I have ever had.  I got an A- in his class but had to study every single day.  After taking final, I couldn't sleep for 4 days until I received my grade because the final was so incredibly hard.  Everyone came out of the final traumatized.  Unfortunately, CCNY makes this course very hard to pass no matter which professor you take.",0
"One of the worst decisions you could make in your life to take this prof. Unintelligible, lacks knowledge, and his lectures are all over the place. He shows us useless videos and you literally cannot understand what he is saying most of the time. Project/labs are difficult and asks for more than what he teaches. Literally regret taking him so much.",0
"At first I hated this class with every fibre of my being. But honestly, once you begin to speak up more and understand her teaching method, she's one of the best professors you can have. She is more than willing to help with anything she can, and gives extensive and useful feedback. Always answers emails quickly. Does everything she can.",1
"While Jeff Marks clearly has a love for Spanish, I had a difficult time learning from him. Nobody asks questions in class because he is intimidating. The way he grades and comments on assignments and papers is somewhat degrading. His tests are extremely hard even after staying up until 5am studying I found myself failing. I wouldn't recommend him.",0
"This teacher, though strict about due dates and attendance, was also understanding. She talks about things that happen to her only to show examples of what she is teaching. She explains what you need to know and clearly states that if you study your quizzes then you will be fine on tests. I would def recommend her, and I would take her again.",1
terrific professor,1
Professor Broome is quite funny.,1
she is one of the best teachers from suffolk.She is really helpfull.whatever she reviews and tell is always on tests. if u study and pay attention in class you will earn the best grade. she is always willing to help her students.I took her for spring 2012 smester and i got an A. I highly recomend taking her. good luck,1
"FSE100 is an easy class on its own, as there are no tests, but Muhlian sure does make it quite unenjoyable. He is very bad at explaining what happens during lab, and oftentimes the whole class (including the TAs) are confused about what we're supposed to be doing. During lecture, he's also confusing and not very engaging .",0
I really enjoyed this class! If you read you will get a good grade!,0
"Professor Wood was one of many teachers I was truly honored to have. She's very endearing and cares about her student's success and well-being. This class is very informative and very helpful with improving public speaking and confidence, and Professor Wood's expertise and knowledge really helps add to your communication skills. Would take again!",1
Murtuza is a bro! Always willing to help. Sometimes his handwriting is hard to read on the board and he talks kindof quietly. All you have to do is ASK HIM TO REPEAT and he always will because he genuinely cares. Ask for help during or outside of class and he'll even schedule extra office hours. He had Sat & Sun hours during finals week for us.,1
He is a great professor! I would take him for every class if I could. He is very clear on what he expects from you. He is a super nice guy and has lots of experience with business and management. It is an easy course but you also learn a lot from him. Highly suggest taking him for any class. His study guides are the test and there's one project.,1
Awesome professor!,1
"By far the absolute greatest advisor, program director and professor I could have ever asked for. She is so kind, caring and down to earth. You can talk to Dr. M about absolutely anything and never feel criticized or looked down upon. Her course content is applicable in the world and she has a wonderful, memorable way of instruction in all courses!",1
"Dr. Bonaccorsci is very clear in her expectations, and is a good lecturer. Her lectures were very reflective of what was going to be on the homework/tests.",1
"Overall a good guy.  He has some really good real world experience and it shows.  He tells you to always ""google"" it first and hates when you ask him something he already answered.  I guess that's how it works after college though.  I'd recommend his class.",1
"History has always been my worst subject but Wells makes me love it!! He is super cool and laid back. He repeats what he says so you have enough time to write things down. He cares about your grades. He will work with you. He is so kind. I would take him over and over again if I could. The test comes from the notes, no tricks.",1
Cares more then any teacher I've ever met.,1
This lady is awesome!!  She totally knows what she is talking about,1
Professor Allen is super enthusiastic and knowledgeable about what he teaches! He works hard to engage with all of his students and the lectures are always well-structured and never dull. A great class to take!,1
"Jacki seriously knows her stuff and she's super informative in class but the serious/casual balance is perfect. All of her reading assignments were fairly intensive but she chose really cool material from great writers. Anytime I needed to reach her, she was accessible & she gives tons of feedback. I knew she knew me. All together, she kills it.",1
Very sweet and nice. Fluent in Italian.  Relates to the students very well.  But doesn't stick to a timeline plan of work (jumps around from assignment to assignment). Easy grader on tests. You'll learn a lot about Italian grammar with her. Speaks in Italian althrough out the class. She's very caring to her students. I recommend her.,1
I took her online course and everything was easy except her papers. I had to work hard on my papers to get a good grade on them. Just make sure you follow her grading rubric. Most of my error came from grammatical errors. I did learn a lot from her class. She does take a bit to grade her stuff usually its the papers. Overall its a good class.,1
"UGHHHH! she thinks she is funny. she is not. she goes on tangents, and doesn't teach! the class goes super slow. it's like a middle-school level class. overall it's very annoying and I feel my brain is dying from lack of use when i sit in her class.",0
"Great modern dance class! Have to show up and try, but a lot of fun! Looked forward to every class.",1
"First time here at SCC and I am taking all Online courses. This teacher was absolutely amazing and she truly cares and wants you to succeed. I feel like her motto is she won't allow you to fail, her course is that organized and very easy to follow and understand. Her feedback is respectful and doesn't discourage you at all. Highly recommend!",1
"The assignments given were very confusing, and not much information is given to complete the assignments. I would not take this class if you are looking for a GPA booster as you put in a lot more work than expected for a first-year course. Would not recommend.",0
"Mr. Buck is a great calculus teacher. He explains everything very well and is always ready to answer any question you might have. If you can find a mistake while he is lecturing, he will give you an extra point on your next test. A lot of homework but it prepares you for the tests.",1
"If you take Ms Fox and manage to come out of the class with a grade other than an A and try to say that you put forth effort, then you're lying. If you go into that class with the mindset that you're going to put forth effort, she will do everything she can to get you an A.",1
"Professor Gentille is amazing and so knowledgeable about child life. She really helps you learn and you truly are able to find interest in what she teaches you. I honestly wish she taught more classes/taught classes in person because I would 100% take them, no matter what they were.",1
Professor Russell is amazing! She is so super nice and is so willing to help. The only thing graded are papers. The papers are typically super easy and the instructions are clear. She gives everyone the opportunity to do well as she does paper draft checks and helps steer our paper the right way!,1
this class is very easy and fun,1
Professor Squire is an awesome guy and very knowledgeable. His classes are never the most rigorous but he's often teaching electives so they don't have to be. Exams are multiple choice and coding projects are very manageable. If you're swamped with classes and need to fit in a CS elective any Squire class will be a joy to take.,1
"Overcomplicates all of the topics, going to class hurts more than it helps. He burns through the material, and the review sessions and practice midterms had nothing to do with the actual test. Gives lots of notes and examples in class, but uses totally different ones on the homework. Would not recommend",0
"100% the best professor I've had at UK so far, he's very passionate and knowledgeable about what he's teaching. There's just a few quizzes, a project, and a few participation points. He's always approachable and willing to help with anything. I wasn't even interested in the subject but he made me love this class. Highly suggest any class with him!",1
"Taking this course with him in the fall is the best decision. Thompson is truly the most caring and articulate professors I have had, especially in chemistry. He explains the material so well and in a simple format. He answers questions well in class and his problem sets are great practice for the exam, which are straightforward & don't trick you",1
"First time to comment, Professor Camaj is terrific, take him if you can. He is very caring and helpful. He wants you to succeed, and he wants to help you. I like him a lot, and I will retake him if I can. Tests and quizzes are not hard, pay attention to lectures and review; you will be fine.",1
"""GOOD MORNING"" ""HAVE I LOST ANYONE"" *random music plays in the background* ""IT HELPS ME GET IN THE ZONE"" Okay Shawn, okay, we get it.",0
"Great teacher, VERY aware, can't get anything by her, a little out there when she was lecturing would rush through content and expected you to know everything. AWESOME clinical instructor and you can learn a lot from her. enjoy and just know your stuff!",1
Frank gives students a handout with all the assignments due so if you want to work ahead you can. Frank has special material he provides himself on the subject. A real treasure for his students. Frank has a passion for your success. You will enjoy all of his classes. He makes learning fun and offers to help students in class with their resumes.,1
She's awesome! I truly feel like she has helped me become a better writer as well as speaker. She went above and beyond to help me every time I asked and even when I did not ask she came to me and made sure I understood everything in class. She makes me laugh in every class and I will be taking her for every english class I ever have to take.,1
"This woman is the devil.she gives no help. If u ask her what u did wrong her reply will be something ""like u don't listen or NO"".. All she dose is talk about herself. And expect you to know ever line of ever poem or story. I wrote a 8 page paper for her and she gave me a 58 on it and told me that was being generous. I asked what I do wrong her reply ""what didn't you do wrong now get out of my office"".. The lady is hart less.. Take her if you want a F-.",0
If you have to take a composition class PLEASE choose Dr. Zbeida! She is very kind and gives great feedback! I am awful at writing and I passed the class with an A. Although she is forgiving you still need to do your work.,1
Ms. Magdaleno is not only an amazing artist but she is a wonderful teacher.,1
Grades more grammer and writing than content. would not recommend this particular professor.,0
"Very good professor. He's helpful if you have any questions. Most of the discussions have no right or wrong answer. They are purely your thoughts on a subject.Do the required reading and assignments, you'll receive a decent grade. He's fair on the assignment grading and will let you know exactly what's expected.",1
"He makes it difficult for a general ed course. He gives random pop quizzes a midterm and 4 to 5 speeches I believe. If you want to major in Coms take his course, if you just need the class as a requirement or transfer, look else where. Im doing fantastic in Organic Chemistry and was struggling in his class if that provides any sort of refrence",1
"Best class at GMU! Very interesting material, inspiring book and lessons. Professor Gentille is super helpful and caring to all her students. There are only a few big assignments, but if you follow along with the class then they aren't hard.",1
"she is giving us a test on thursday and a final on tuesday. pshh. what the crap is that. ha, i guyess it doesn't matter but i will cry anyways.",0
Ms Gray  is a wonderful teacher.  She makes class interesting and fun.  I looked forward to each class I attended and was very depressed when it came to an end.    As a returning student  my experience was so positive I plan to continue taking courses at U.S. I.  I hope that I am fortunate enough to get another teacher with her knowledge & caliber.,1
A wonderful professor who really gives his all when teaching his students. His style of teaching is really personal and gives you great insight into the communications sector. The exercises used in class were great for developing who I am as a storyteller and individual.,1
"At times, his lectures can be hard to follow, but if you go to office hours he will do his best to help you understand it. or just raise your hand and ask your question during class, he has no problem helping you through the material while he is teaching it. Overall, he is a good professor, but it might take you a week to get used to his accent.",1
Rob is one of the best professors I have had. He is very helpful and understanding. ,1
"He is an amazing teacher! I took this class as a hybrid and it worked really well with my schedule. His work isn't hard if you take the time to do them. If you listen and follow his instruction you should easily get an A. I will take more classes from him. I would highly recommend, we didn't take any test, we just did the 2 major papers quizzes, hw",1
Terrible!! He doesn't give you near enough time on his quizzes or exams. If you don't know the information as he does you will run out of time. His study guides are ridiculously long and you have to write essays along with your 80 questions on exams. He does give extra credit was the only bonus but you have tons of other work too.,0
"As a teacher myself, this guy could use some pedagogy classes. Sure, he knows the material, but can he teach? No. I had to practically teach myself. If you asked him a question he would belittle you in front of the whole class. I think he means well, perhaps he should be working with more advanced students, not amateurs. Avoid this class if possibl",0
"Dudley is an amazing professor who cares about students and is naturally funny. She's very enthusiastic and passionate about marine biology! Be sure to show up to lectures because those notes will be important. The labs she assigns are incredibly fun and informational, especially the field labs. Not much effort beyond notes and occasional reading.",1
She is an easy teacher but argues points that are no longer truse since she hasn't been in a classroom for years.,0
"Mrs. McGee is an amazing instructor. She is fun, silly, hilarious, really cute, and a great at teaching the material. Her class is not easy, so don't be mistaken, you just need to put in the effort by studying. I had one of the highest averages in the class and still felt stressed at times. Its all about studying! I highly recommend her.",1
Profesor Nesvig was such a great teacher. It was such an amazing experience to go to his class. He always explained his subjects with details and you can tell that he put many years and time into perfecting his lesson plan. It was not a hard class at all; the quizzes were super easy just a few short-answer questions. Awesome class.,1
"I want to hear the professor lecture to get a better understanding of these older texts. I don't understand why she insists on listening to other students opinions the majority of the class time. I get it, participation matters however we do not pay to hear fellow students' tedious musings. Enjoyed the material, not the professor.",0
Very nice professor! He definately knows his stuff! Pay attention in class and do all assignments and you should be fine.,1
"This class is difficult if youre lazy and/or unmotivated. Wouldnt recommend to someone who graduated alted or by the bare minimum. If youre focused and have a passion for writing or poetry, take Dominguez. Hes a tough grader but taking and passing his class will make you an amazing writer.",1
"Awesome professor that pushes his students to do well in the class. Lots of different things are weighted to determine your grade, so doing poorly on a quiz or two is not a huge deal. Group projects are very fun and engaging. Professor McKnight is the man.",1
He was my absolute favorite professor. He gives you readings before every class but they are not that long and most are enjoyable. Sometimes he gives pop quizzes on them but they are not difficult. The final is a two minute speech on any topic! One of the nicest guys I have met. He even threw a BBQ for his students at the end of the semester.,1
"It was a huge pain to take his class but was worth the effort. Every week, we had to read 2 long chapters and write summary/response for each chapter as we had to take quizzes on the same chapter during class. He does roll call and if you missed your name by 30 sec, you are marked late. Overall, he teaches interesting stuff & Ur Effort  Ur grade.",1
"Very funny and tries to make history interesting for those who aren't interested at all.  Only 2 exams, midterm and final.  Pretty easy grader.  Loves when you participate.",1
This class was taken during covid. He has 3 tests and a final which replaces your lowest test grade. During tests you only have 1 chance to choose your answer and his questions are super specific. You need to memorize over 200 power point slides to even get a 70 in a test. He says to only know the purple words on PowerPoints but that' not enough.,0
"Super fun and engaging class. Discussions and participation count toward the grade, but they are casual chats/thoughts. Funny, caring, and engaging teacher, but specific when it comes to listening and participating. Take notes based on the material he talks about because it is needed for the two-three tests given. Easy A kind of class.",1
She is a great professor and the class was very straight forward with just 5 essays pretty much being the entirety of what the class is. The only issue I had was that it felt pointless to go to class and this class seems to be meant for online.,1
"He wasn't very thorough on how to actually solve most of the equations he'd talk about. Also, his examples on how to solve the problems were less than mediocre. He doesn't really put that much effort into his lectures.",0
"She is an amazing instructor. You can never be bored in class because she lectures in a way that grabs your attention. She also does group discussions a lot which was a great way to get the students engaged. Assignments are only responses of guest lectures we see and the occasional extra readings assigned. I had the textbook, but didn't need/use it",1
"Overall this class was very fair and very easy, you will enjoy the professors teachings as well as the topics you learn in class. There are 12 worksheets quite a few in class participation papers, 2 essays and presentations. For the 3 exams she allows you to use notecards on them and as long as you know the general information you should be fine.",1
I ddin't learn much.,0
"So, any good comments must have been writtenby this prof; clarity is absent; speaks in phrases, not sentences. There is no cohesion. Should be a libray science instructor or a scheduler for author appearances at bookstores. All her classes are EXACTLY THE SAME! DOesn't anybody check what goes on at ECSU?",0
"Paul is one of the best professors I've had at SC. His lectures can be long, but he does his best to make each one lively and always takes some jabs at the industry. The 2 midterms are a piece of cake. Just take notes, do the study guide and you should get an A in the class. Go to his office hours, too. He's always got something interesting to say.",1
Great person but that's about it. Mostly rambles in class and his study guides are weird in that they consist of questions so I would say I mostly taught myself through articles he assigned and google. There are better USST GEs out there.,1
Had a 79% and she wouldn't give me the B-.She's a critic of everything you write.Very intimidating.One of those type of professors that you wish you never had.Unfriendly.Just plain simple t-e-r-r-i-b-l-e.,0
She's helpful and makes the class fun! Definitely promotes friendships within the class and wants you to pass. She makes sure to answer every question that you might have! She also posts the book (an older version) link for everyone so I never even looked at the book. ,1
"I read the comments before I had taken Dr. Paul and I was a bit discouraged, but he turned out to be a very good professor. He is very clear as to what he expects. I worked in a group that was horrible and I was scared we would not pass. I reached out to Dr. Paul to let him know the many challenges that I had to face. He was very understanding.",1
"this professor is easy going. lecture is from textbook. homework mostly are easy, a few hard. exams are from the easy problems of homework. some exams problems are direct ""repeat"" of homework. ",1
Ms. Bland is a very good teacher. I really enjoyed her class.,1
"Amazing professor. He's what I wish all UW profs were like, genuine, helpful, and understanding. I took this class on a whim as a business major and it turned out to be my favorite class I've ever taken at UW. My group project was something I was very passionate about and the class taught me all to successfully accomplish it.",1
"GREAT GUY! He is very funny, and makes class interesting. There is a ton of reading, but no deadlines for it. He just says ""as long as you read this for the test, you'll be okay."" He makes learning Econ very interesting and brings outside, real-life examples to class. Never boring.",1
He gives a quiz every week. We had a midterm and right after we were done he gave us another quiz. Hes a tough grader and his comments are harsh and not very constructive. He does allow late work and he does drop your lowest quiz grades but hes a very tough teacher,1
"Okay, normally college professors are bland and just assign assignments, grade them, and give help when asked. Professor Reese is completely different. He is outgoing, vibrant, and hilarious. I actually look forward going to his classes, and I never want to skip because of how entertaining he is. He is awesome and take him if you can!",1
Alisa is an amazing teacher. She explains things very clearly and works through problems step-by-step. She is willing to work with students both inside and outside of class and puts a lot of time into her lessons. I would recommnd Alisa's class to everyone!,1
"Really good teacher! If you do your homework, and study, it is really easy!",1
RUDE. Hard to understand she has a heavy Indian accent. AVOID THIS WOMAN.,0
She's late every. single. day. and keeps you late. every. single. day.,0
TAs did all of the work on grading. Class was pretty basic and only discussed problem issues in forensic science. Timed exam (60 mins) on over a thousand plus pages of material and articles. Not a PhD instructor which really takes away from the quality of education at ASU. Did not comment on any assignments but did offer help when needed/asked.,0
"Prof Laucella is the sweetest person I've ever met! She's so caring and wants you to do well. If you show up, you will most likely get an A if you do the assignments. So glad I got her for this class my first semester of college & I highly recommend her.",1
"(part 2) Cons(2): For each questions he gives only TWO answer choices in sample exam (SE) but the problem is many times the answer to a particular question is NOT there, so you have to find it either online or in his Handouts. Cons (3) Roughly 5% of the questions on the exam are completely unfair, which makes it impossible to get a 100 or even a 95",1
If you don't understand math Professor Trower is your man. He can bring down math like science. I would highly recommend him to anyone. He understands math like no one I've ever seen. I would give him an A+,1
"If you show him you care and try, he will help you out with the material and with your grade. His lectures are funny and he usually doesn't bore you or make you stay longer than you need to.",1
She is really strict. but if you hard work you can get a good grade,1
"Absolutely horrible teacher, worst I have ever had in my life I dreaded going to her class every day. She grades the first two pages of an essay and then doesn't read the rest if she doesn't like what she has read. Also on the day any major essay is due no matter the excuse she will mark you down 10 percent on the essay if you are a minute late.",0
Makes learning stress-free. She keeps us up-to-date with emails and is a fair grader. Gives great feedback. She knows her subject and has useful things that she emails us with. A great online course.,1
"Professor Chambers is a dedicated and caring professor.  She helped me on her own time and helped me pass the course.  She made an investment in me and believed in me, which inspired me to work hard.  If you are struggling, all you need to do is ask for help and she will make the same investment in you as she did in me.  If you care, she cares!!",1
The professor is very bad at teaching. She refuses to help and is very rude and mean to all students. She thinks thats shes better than everyone. DO NOT TAKE!!!! Horrible teacher. Never expirced someone as bad as her,0
"The lectures are very informative and easy to listen to. If you complete the assigned reading and listen to the lectures the assignments and tests won't be an issue. She also responds to emails quickly if you need clarification, and does what she can to help you succeed. She is the most helpful professor I've had at NKU.",1
"My course was three hours along during this past summer. The classes are long, and he fully delivers his 3 hours. The homework is easy, and he posts his study guide online for his tests. You need to pay attention because even after studying the guide, tests were still difficult. Attendance is lenient, however he does take row twice. ",1
"I learned SO MUCH in this class from Prof. McKenna. I'm a sophomore and have had 400-level classes where I didn't learn nearly as much. Everything on the exams are from lecture, readings, and discussions so just make sure you show up, take good notes, and read. It's not an easy class, but its not hard either. Take him!",1
I would say that she is one of the best professors in the CDDS department. She provides great insight into her responsibilities as a speech-pathologist and has contagious energy and interest into the subject matter. Tests are half multiple choice and half fill in so be prepared to study  for that. 4 tests in total.,1
"best teacher ever. I had never liked anything related to science until i met this teacher. the class is easy, the exams are easy just need to study the material from class. i would recommend this teacher.",1
Tam is really chill. No midterms No final. Just some class quizzes. I hear she used to be really hard but she has calmed down a lot and I loved the class. It was fun.,1
Very engaging lectures. Gives great feedback. She is willing to go over your assignments with you before you submit them. Gives a little bit of extra credit.,1
What do you do after a political career? Teach at a college! This class will have you staring at the clock. The minutes seem like hours and the hours seem like days. There are opportunities to meet members of the political community and the guest speakers are intriguing. Other than that it's an easy A without much learning. #whygottocollegeagain?,0
Very approachable and friendly prof. Ask lots of questions!,1
"Funny teacher, always willing to help, explains concepts well, work load is average. Really worth taking his class.",1
"He made Trigonometry really easy and I was able to pick it up quickly. Nice guy, he makes it really hard to get a bad grade in this class.",1
"I loved this class, very interesting! Lectures are lengthy but she keeps it fun and is always making jokes. The test were online, as long as you study and keep up with the quizzes you will be good! Highly recommend.",1
"If you learn well from a teacher who sits behind a projector all class, scribbling on paper, she's your lady.  Half the time you could barely see what she was writing when she was going through examples. Horrible class.",0
"This professor provides absolutely no value to his profession. He is not available and fears confrontation so he simply does not answer questions. He teaches a subject that promotes being open-minded; however, he is fiercely close-minded. I would not have taken him had I know his history, which is found by typing his name into a search engine.",0
Lecture is long monotone and straight from the power points. everyone falls asleep everyday. I dread this class. While a very kind and friendly woman I would not recommend her for any subject or class. Everyone failed her tests only one A and 3 B's out of 50+ students in my section. No one knows where her test questions come from,0
He is the best professor I have ever had. He is super caring and will give you extra time to finish an assisment if you cant get it to him on the due date.,1
"This is a pretty easy class to make an A in. His lectures aren't super interesting but if you take decent notes you should be able to make an A or B on the tests (all of which were online.) He randomly takes attendance but I missed a couple and he still gave me a 100. 3 tests, 1 group project, attendance.",1
"Loved Creative Writing with Carlton. Chillest professor on campus. Talks a lot about his book, not that I minded. (It's a great book.) Brings up super interesting and relevant topics and has you read really good short stories. We watched a few movies too. The portfolios are not as scary as they sound if you keep up with the work. Awesome professor.",1
Great professor. I highly recommend him for any class he teaches,1
Dr. Cutler was not ment to teach! She only likes you if you understand and do well in her class otherwise she basically makes the whole class know your dumb. if you ask for help she brushes you off and does not answer your questions. she also rarely does example problems and when she does she does not finish them. Do not take this professor!!!!!!!!,0
Really easy class. He is very laid back and was willing to help. I just wish he was more consistent in his grading. He would mark down little things and dock a ton of points and then would do it on the next assignment and only take off one point. Very strange but overall a great teacher.,1
The way she does her class is nightmarish first she makes the most interesting subjects seem boring she basically allows you to cheat on ur online quizs does not have a midterm but a cumulative final that is guaranteed to screw u over 90 MC 5 T/F 3 SA doesnt do a review class because she believe that you should of been studying all year,0
I had her a little over a year back but she's still one of my favorite instructors and is the kindest person I've met here.,1
"Course wasn't that difficult, but it was really demanding. 5 projects, which are easy, but instructions are kind of indirect. There's rubrics, but they don't help much. Quite a talker, too. By week 3 I was really irritated with the aggressive lecture method. Extremely nice woman, just a bit excessive at times. Course does help in the real world.",1
Your review is graded at the same time as your test so go over your review with a tutor to make sure you have something correct to look at for your test. Tests and reviews are only graded by percentage you will not know what you got wrong unless you specifically talk to teacher.,0
"Did a great job. Take him over any Econ 302 teacher. He can be a little dry and boring, but he's very fair, generous and won't make you feel dumb if you have question.",1
Professor Woodman made lectures enjoyable which made up for the fact that she enforced attendance. She responds to emails quickly and is always very nice and helpful. All homework and quizzes are online and you can work as far ahead as you want; midterm and final were really easy.,1
Assignments are mysterious. Grading is unfair. This professor is one of the worst I have ever had!,0
"one presentation. three small quizzes. the hardest part is executing the lab reports. i thought 3 hours will be enough, it turns out that 3 hours is enough for 50% of the paper. he tried to be funny...fail...but good intention",1
"Dr. Paoline is very caring and always answers emails within the same day. I took this class online and it consisted of 4 tests. The tests were completely based on the lectures with few questions from the two books required. If you write down everything verbatim from the lectures you will do good on the exams, so get ready to write a lot.",1
"Professor Gonzalez is a god! Really cares about the class, very friendly, approachable and accommodating if you need an extension and truly learnt so much in her class. Overall a prof with incredibly positive vibes, a clear marking scheme of 3 tests, 10 weekly quizzes and an easy essay and I wish I could have her for a class again",1
"Brandi is very rude. She does not give clear instructions, she changes due dates and does not feel the need to tell you,  she plays favoritism, and makes the class so much harder than it needs to be.",0
"The guy is a goof ball, but in a good way. He's so interesting, I can't wrap my head around it. It's like he's a child sometimes, but he sure is brilliant too. He does talk a lot, which can be good if you have a taste for that. He's entertaining to listen to, but can be boring. The class is super easy, do homework every week, and show up to class.",1
"Great prof, great class. I don't get what other people are talking about. ",1
"Mr. McEntire is an exceptional teacher of drama. He gives TONS of extra credit by watching videos in class, seeing playsmusicals at TCC or outside of class. He lets you know when a quiz is coming. Several short quizzes, 2 tests, 1 analysis essay over a play of your choice. He makes things very interesting!  Very funny guy, Highly recommended.",1
"Brooke has a reputation on campus for the best Trig teacher out there. She is the best! If you struggle with the math she will help one on one. You must attend all lectures to stay on track. She always wants to help every student succeed. Yes I only got a high B but if you work hard, she admires you and helps you. She inspires you to keep going.",1
"One of the best teachers I've ever had.  For 5 weeks class, there are 4 tests and book report (u don't need to read the book, even he said so). Tests come from lectures. If ur high school student and need to take STAAR, i recommend doing the practice tests. U probably saw this at least 25 times, but his lectures  are stunning and electrifying!! ;D",1
"I think she is a good professor, because she always responds fast to emails; she is polite, not stuck-up; she is always helpful and flexible. To be objective, I think her weak qualities are that she mostly reads most of lecture material from slide shows rather than explaining it in own words; no smile, most of the time she looks too serious.",1
"I took his online class and loved it. He provides all of the reading materials online. We had reading requirements for the week, discussions, and two essays. He gives great feedback, is extremely helpful, and gives plenty of time for everything. This is an honors class so the final was a presentation, but it's fairly easy for a college course.",1
"Mme Anthony is an amazing teacher! Yes, she makes you work for your grade, but with that being said, she genuinely wants her students to learn and to succeed. She is very organized and clear in what she expects from you. Her assignments are interesting and enjoyable; I would take this class again!",1
"Professor Morra is very clear about what it takes to get an A.  All that he assigns are 2 papers for the midterm and final.  I wrote 18 pages each and received a 94.  Don't buy the book, it will be a waste.  It was a 3 hour class and he would keep us for one hour tops.  His lectures are very interesting!",1
"lectures are very helpful as long as you don't skip class you will pass. if you miss a class go to office hours, or if you don't understand something. He will let you know when all your exams will be and which chapters, he might let you use an index card during exams. Also, he makes the class funny sometimes.",1
"Professor GZ is wonderful, her in-class explanations of Calc 2 topics are very relevant and down-to-earth. She has incredible patience for simple questions, and is persistent in working through student struggles.",1
"She's a proud woman and doesn't deal with people who cause trouble, so knowing a little bit about Spain (where she's from) couldn't hurt... Anyway, I liked her. She isn't a hard grader but there's a lot of work involved (book work, online assignments, etc.), none of which is too hard. Overall, she's a good teacher and explains lessons very well.",1
"I want to start with the most pointed out aspect. He is very stern, his grading can be tough, and he can seem rude at times. Now that that's out, that's how most STEM professors will be. Howell knows what he's doing and if you're willing to learn, and you can take how he talks, he's a great asset. He gave me a great wake up call, and would recc him",1
"At first was very interested in the topic at hand, Feminist Anthropology. But my interests quickly dropped due to the lack of direction and off topic rants. Horrible at returning assignments on time! I do not recommend this prof. Gave her two chances and that was more than enough. Not worth the money.",0
"Nice dude, but you dont learn anything in his classes!",0
"Professor never lectured, just posted videos. His exams were nothing like the homework, it was as if the professor was trying to trick the students rather than test their knowledge. Worst professor I've had at OU so far, he just didn't seem to care about his students at all.",0
Dr. Self was a great professor and he actually made this class pretty interesting. He tests more on concepts than memorization so make sure you understand the material. Going to class and taking good notes or recording the lectures will help you succeed in this class. I think he's one of the better professors in the M&M program.,1
hard but great at explaining,1
This class should honestly be taken before any other biology classes because it provides useful information that helps you understand biology. Also no math in a statistics class!,1
"Even though it was online I enjoyed this class a lot! I feel like I actually learned things & she is super sweet & her online lectures were very helpful. She provides helpful feedback and the rubrics are super clear, this was one of the easiest A's I've ever gotten! Def take this class if you can, I adore her!!!",1
"Amazing.  Really helps when a student needs it.  sarcastic at time, but a lot of fun.",1
"Fun, brilliant And provocative. Warn will force you to speak up in class, and you will actually enjoy it. His teaching style is one of confrontation as he directly engages students in class discussion, sometimes at random. Be prepared to change the way you think in class",1
"Tries to maintain a balance between liberal and conservative political interpretations, but is definitely left-leaning. She is open-minded about politics, but the care ethic is very strong in her. There is A LOT of reading for this class and so if you aren't inherently interested in the subject, take a different class. Grading depends on your TA.",1
She's a very nice teacher just do your work and make sure all assignments are on time she doesn't like late work. If you do whats expected which isn't much you will for sure to get an easy A. This class has helped me especially since i'm not big on speaking in front of people but she made it simple and easy.,1
"Nice professor. Always available for help. He talks really fast and doesn't review practice problems unless someone asks when it's something he considers easy. So speak up and rewatch his videos which are posted online. Material is tough IMO. If you are more of a biochem/organic type person, this class may be challenging.",1
"Professor Wood is the best. I'm so happy I took her. I wish all instructors were like her. Seriously, I'm telling the truth. She cares about her students. You do need you book. Take her class if you need or want to take COMSTD 2.",1
"No one stopped any student from getting this experience prior to entering the program, in fact it was recommended to all, for good reason OBVIOUSLY. If a student chooses to do the bare minimum to get into the program, and then expect to be able to continue to do the same and succeed, they didn't belong there to start with.",1
"Pretty solid choice. ECO165 is not an easy class, but he does his best to make it better. There is a lot of in class quizzes, but he tells you in advance. Also, the homework uses Inquizative, and its a very odd homework platform. Very nice guy, and makes the class interesting.",1
"I absolutely loved this class, Steve really worked to make the material interesting and relevant to social issues, when it easily could have been just a ""monster story"" class. Really nice and funny which made it easy to talk to him and discuss essay ideas. With more confidence he will be an outstanding professor.",1
"Dan is an awesome professor, so intelligent.  I was both a student in his class and a TA for him as well.  He's very reasonable.  Although there is heavy reading in the course, they are for the most part very interesting. Make friends with your TA!!...Dan gives total power to his TA's in deciding grades, extensions, etc.",1
SHE DOES ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AT ALL. REFUSES TO HELP STRUGGLING STUDENTS. AVOID AT ALL COSTS,0
"When taking this class, you would have to be prepared to teach the material to yourself. He does not use any power points. You must read the textbook chapters, which are extremely long. His test are impossible to pass, even though they are multiple choice. Additionally, you have to read two long novels outside of class. If you don't, then you fail",0
"I have never experienced a professor so demoralizing, ignorant, and loathsome in my life. Your grade will suffer if you disagree with her. I came into this course excited to learn and came out feeling personally victimized. Gives papers with no guidance and expects you to turn in graduate level work. Take this professor and you will regret it.",0
"Leikind is a really nice guy, just a boring class. The final is worth 30% and it's difficult. Also, he keeps you in class very late. Wouldn't recommend registering for a class immediately after his.",1
"please do not take her course. even if you just want to finish up the English series and she's the only prof with an open seat.... do not do it. there's a reason her classes never fill up. and if they do, trust in 2 weeks half the class will drop. just finish up your other breadth classes or wait until a better TA opens up a seat in their class.",0
"Witelski is an amazing professor. The material isn't easy but he is super accessible and willing to answer questions both in and outside of class. His lectures are extremely clear. Good professor, clear expectations, and a great sense of humor.",1
If you're looking for a laid back professor then def chose Dr. Richmond. She's great for all majors. You definitely learn in depth but also have little to no assignments throughout the semester.,1
Extremely caring professor. He gives out every possible resource prior to the test. If you get anything lower than a B you put no effort in the class. Nice guy and easy grader.,1
"Most amazing professor I've ever had, usually when the professor is a literature fanatic they would get lost in the world of their own thoughts while explaining about the work, Prof P not only introduced awesome works she also guided us through with passion and encouragement. I'm totally not a Lit person, but I've definitely enjoyed her class.",1
Great Professor who clearly has a passion for her subject and teaching!  Truly cares about the students in her class and really easy to talk to if you need help or just wanna chat!,1
"She is super accommodating, available, and helpful. What will get you through this class is reaching out and using your resources. It was a heavy workload but easy material so stay on top of your time management and youre good. Shes an amazing professor if you arent busy being mad about your workload",1
"Meyers cemented my choice to be an English major. She is incredibly insightful and cares to learn about contemporary opinions regarding the aged works we cover. The midterms and papers are straightforward and we are prepared adequately for them. Don't miss any readings, take good notes and you'll get the A. Best professor for the material!!!",1
I question how much he really knows about organic chemistry. He doesn't do a good job of explaining the material and if you ask him for help all he does is tell you to refer to the book or he PP usually neither are helpful. Buy the Chegg homework helper you get more help from that than Luttrell,0
His tests are very difficult. Not because the material is hard but because he does not know how to word the tests. He is very confusing and become defensive when you try to get clarity. I would not recommend taking this class.,0
She is tough. Hard to pass her class. She does not tell you what to expect out of your speeches and expects them to be A+ material. She is mean and unpleasant to talk to.,0
"I highly recommend taking Ms. Jackson's class. This class was live online but half online. Instructions are clear , with about 3 assignments due a week. Group discussions were fun, quizzes on each Chapter but its open book. I learned a lot in class and I hope to take her other classes in the future. An A grade is there if you want it.",1
"One of the best professors i have ever had! Her class is super laid back, funny, and extremely intelligent . Her grading is not hard at all and she is super flexible with due dates. She goes above and beyond her duty to help others. I would definitely take her again.",1
Very easy and straightforward instructor. You can show up and pass. She has a lot of in class writings but if you miss those she has so much extra credit it is impossible not to pass the class. Textbook online. Weekly journals. EASY Final project. Class was boring though. I just needed the WI credit. Recommend her to anyone needing an easy class.,1
"If you need a science class take AST 103 with Daniel Proga! his lectures are very interesting and he makes the class fun and making you want more. He gives you the actual test questions but you have to find the answers on your own from the textbook. My advice, if you want an A in the class read the textbook, study for exams and pay attention!",1
She's a good teacher. She has some good stories and she has a great sense of humor:) recommend,1
"He was very helpful whenvever you need help at office hours. Online quizes were great. If you do bad on one, you can make it up on the next. His tests have more than 50% of the problems from the homework. The final has a lot of problems that were right from the in class test. Buy the solutions manual to do the homework- it is definitly worth it!",1
"Fairly simple class, not a lot of time outside of class besides reading a ton of children's lit which I found to be the most useful assignment that I've had in the college of education. You have a 100% choice of what you read, also! Some busy work, but it's the same in all of the sections.",1
"Dr Costanza gives a fail-proof lecture in World Religion. You have a whole week to complete two short assignments, and some weeks there's only one assignment. A couple easy, short writing pieces, a brief anthropological study, and you're on your way to an A! A passionate teacher, but often unforgiving about missing class or work.",1
Worst class I have ever taken. I would not take another class from him in my life. ,0
"I had Professor Blankenship for Online English 112. She is a great instructor and is very understanding, even towards people with disabilities. She is not a tough grader and if you dont understand something, she will take time out to explain it to you. It was a privilege to be in her class.",1
She is so passionate and so knowledgable about the social work field. She is very hands on and open minded. She makes the classroom a safe environment to talk about anything and everything. After taking her class i decided to become a social work major,1
"Yes, she can be a very tough grader on final assignments, but she offers plenty of opportunities to correct mistakes before submitting work. She is very understanding and very down-to-earth.",1
You will have a lot of homework if you take his class!!!,0
"Professor Swift assigns a LOT of homework, but only collects a portion of it using Gradescope. I did terrible on the first exam because I only did what was collected. I started work all the the problems in his ""Recommended Homework"". Almost all Exam 2 and Final came from these problems. He is very fair if you have done the work.",1
"Mrs. Wight was not a bad professor, but she was very insecure about her teaching, and it showed. She wasnt completely sure how she should do certain things, which made the test and projects confusing. She gave extra credit at the end of the semester.",1
"Professor Liggin is an amazing professor. The lectures are exciting. attendance is not mandatory but if you skip class, you won't pass. Professor has a bold sense of humor that will keep the class engage if you have questions ask he will answer!!!! Take him, best professor",1
Fantastic Prof who really cares and likes engaging with students. Wish I didn't have to take the class online.,1
Professor warn is very laid back there are not to many assignments. He cares about what he is teaching and talks from experience that is what keeps you interested. He's a great professor who enjoys what he is teaching which helps with learning about the different topics its an easy class you will enjoy.,1
Lots of homework and quizzes. Had to read chapters of the textbook for very annoying facts and questions. Never even talked or met my professor.,1
"This was my first time taking this teacher. The assignments and class presentation were straightforward. There were reading responses each week, a presentation, & there were two options for papers: a few short papers or a longer paper that's due @ the end of semester. I like how she was very understanding, especially cuz of the pandemic.",1
"Professor Reynolds is one of the best professors I've had the privilege to meet in college. He tries his best to maintain neutrality when class conversation arises, but definitely is well versed in complex social issues. It was a great course and I learned a lot.",1
Seriously one of the best teachers I've had so far. Keeps everyone engaged in the class by calling random people to answer questions. Only 3 exams.,1
Not that bad. He's very funny and helpful. Not an easy teacher but he just wants everyone to actually work. Follow along in the book since his tests are the book tests. He gives a quiz every class and your average can replace your lowest test score. Do ALL the homework and study often and you can do well in his class. Better than the other teachers,1
"Connie Anderson is so nice, and makes giving speeches FUN and not intimidating. I highly recommend her.",1
worst professor i've ever had. though she's interested in the photography she is not very good at teaching the important stuff ie. the photographer/ his background/ ideologies and theories. her assignments are too vague and she grades unfairly.,0
"Dr. Curtis is hilarious and informative! Read textbook, tests are super hard if you don't! Tests are only multiple choice but you need to read book! The first test is the most difficult, seek help from a tutor to make it a lot easier!! She's the best but can be a tad scatterbrain. Write down every grade you receive & make sure final grade matches.",1
Dr. B is a very effective professor and will take time to make sure you understand a topic. He shows great interest in the work and has many years of experience to help. A field activity is required in 101 and it is a great help.,1
turtles all the way down,1
"Hines wasn't too bad, but definitely made me uneasy with how many mistakes he made and made things more confusing/difficult than necessary. Just ask if you need help. I if you know this material already, it is the easiest A ever.  DO NOT BUY THE BOOK. useless & access code gives you an Ebook anyway.",1
He just isn't a good teacher. He knows the material for Technical Theatre but has no clue as to what it takes to teach a class. He can be very rude and derogatory to students and doesn't understand how to teach in a way that students can understand. I didn't have a problem in the class and got out with an A but most weren't as lucky.,0
"worst teacher ever.. dont take her.. you'll regret it.. she's mean, bitter and wont ever help you..",0
"I found Jamie's lectures hard to follow. When I asked her for help, I was usually left more confused and slightly insulted.  Assignments are fair and the quizzes are very straight forward. If you can figure out what  Jamie wants, you will do well, if not, try to maintain your sanity.",0
Great slides and goes over lots of example questions.  Knows his material very well.  Nice guy.  Good at explaining concepts.  Midterm and final weren't super hard but there were some challenging questions.  Thought that some midterm questions were a bit irrelevant (not what we learned or from Chem 112).  I would take another class with him!,1
He is very knowledgeable about the subject. There are only three quizzes and one group presentation that's the entire course work. No homework at all and exams. He is easy. It's an easy A class with this prof he wants students to learn. Would recommend him 100%.,1
"If you can tolerate a jolly man giving 1.5 hour long proofs on the chalkboard, this is the class for you.  The course material is interesting, but I would recommend bringing a crossword puzzle to class.",1
Jim has a lot of experience and wisdom to offer. It was difficult for me to keep track of assignments this semester and it would be helpful if he used blackboard. Group activities weren't really taken seriously and took up a big block of the semester. It was hard for me to care about the assignments and class in part because of the groups.,1
"Dr. Swift is super friendly. He is very helpful and patient. I took him for 4280 last summer, it was online. I work hard because he expects a lot. His lecture videos are good and helps me. I would recommend him for this course and 3140 also.",1
"Dr. Portaro is very friendly and a great Spanish teacher! As long as you attend class and do your part to study/learn the material, then this class will be a breeze. She's also very good at spending more time on topics that everyone needs more practice on. Overall great teacher and class!",1
Doesnt explain things to where everyone can understand. Expects everyone to learn the same. Makes you feel like youre stupid if you dont understand something.,0
"He means well but he's not the best professor. He tries his best to explain things but does not do so very well. Although he's not the best professor he's very friendly and will try to help you however he can. Very easy grader. If you are looking for an easy A, this is the professor to choose. If you want actually want to learn, choose someone else",1
"This teacher is awesome. I really hate writing, but she makes it great. My first writing teacher sucked and made me hate writing, but Professor Felber really is great. She uses screen cast when grading papers which makes for great feedback. Best teacher I've had by far.",1
I'm taking Dr Mukherjee for Calc 2 and he is one the worst professors I could ever have. Only 1 week left in this class. He doesn't offer to help students and never goes over homework or tests so you wont know what the answers are for exams. Blames students for not knowing certain material and he wont teach students. I'll never take him again��,0
"The Professor is helpful, but prepare have the worst grading system used on all your problem sets and test. Recommend if you take her class, make sure all your work is 100% correct or she will take points off for every little thing you do wrong",1
"My favorite professor ever! his class is never boring, he knows his stuff, and he's considerate towards his students. If steve martin was an agronomist this would be him. I can't tell you enough how much I love being around this guy.",1
"cool professor. chill, understanding and cultured",1
I don't know how the E.E. Department allows this kind of professor to get tenure. He barely speaks English. His lectures are so boring and useless that he now has to do pop quizzes just to make sure that people come to the class. He also is not fare grading. It?s a shame that people like him teach mandatory courses in the curriculum,0
"Ouyang is nice, but a really difficult professor.  He reads straight off the slides, offers no real explanations, and the project work is insanely difficult.  If you take this course, pair yourself up with someone strong in accounting, especially if your new to the topic.",0
Feminist theory is undeniably a difficult topic.  Prof. Shaw makes it understandable without oversimplifying it at all.  She is a hard but fair grader.  Overall a great professor.  Made me think critically.  I learned a lot.,1
"If you are a student with accommodations do not take this professor ! When simply informing her about my accommodations of extra time she acted completely unprofessional and did not understand why I needed this extra time, when clearly I have a reason approved by the SSD office! Terrible experience all around!",0
Solid Prof. Lots of reading and decent amount of writing/discussion. Is able to make dry topics engaging. Great class if you have a decent amount of B.G. info about the bible.,1
"would rather take 3 classes of biology and do a ton of research papers than to take this teacher again, can't explain the material well enough and doesn't give tests that are relevant to the classes point of material covered, students beware...",0
"Hes the worst teacher Ive ever had in any subject. And I graduated years ago. Trust all the bad things people are saying. They are not just disgruntled students, I personally aced his classes. Hes just not a good person.",0
"I just want to say that she is one of the best professors in DC. A lot of quick quizzes, very little homework, She just gives some assignments which are so easy to get 90-95%. Also, very clear lectures. Highly recommended.",1
easy A if you listen to lectures and do what she tells you,1
"Randomly jumps years,religions,people,topics. ",0
"Really nice lady! She is super helpful! As long as you do the work, you will pass!",1
Decent professor. Plays favorites so get on his good side fast and you're golden. If you don't then good luck to you. Talks in rounds. It takes him an hour what others could explain in minutes. He does know his stuff and can be helpful with detail stuff. Tip: he Loves cats. Use it to your advantage,1
"Found Layoun to be hard to follow (goes off on many tangents), but she knows what she's talking about.  Novels are insightful and generally good reads.  No exams in this class, only papers, which is great if you're a strong writer!  Put in a little effort and you'll get an A.  Attendance mandatory.",1
"Not an easy class, material is very boring, lectures are very boring and hard to stay awak during, however Zengdao is a nice guy and is helpful and wants students to do well in his class",1
"Really thick accent and at times hard to understand. Quizzes can be rough, but they were taken online so it makes it 10x easier. I got an A, but that's because I scored almost a perfect score on the final. You don't have to show up every single day, but you do need to come to class like 90% of the time. ",0
Good teacher. Be ready to read BEFORE going into class or you might be awaken with a surprise that you will not like. He gives extra credit and will help you along the way in this class.,1
One of the best professor ever.  Very knowledgeable about various topics and enthusatic about what he teaches.  What a hottie!,1
Worst prof. graduating...actually believes too many Finance degrees are awarded at SU.  Likes to fail half the class.,0
"I took his summer Calculus II class and it was very organized. He'll spend the extra time to make sure everyone understands what's going on; lectures are straightforward. As long as you keep up with the homework quizzes and tests aren't that bad, though he likes to test on details. Didn't grade too harshly. Really liked his passion for the subject.",1
An amazing teacher i enjoyed being in her class she made math easy and understandable ,1
"a tough grader, but helpful and quickly responds to emails.",1
He's amazing! The tests are more understanding rather than memorizing. I did micro with Dr. White so this class was a breeze for me,1
Course is very comprehensive but examples are clear and extremely helpful. Professor is very helpful and clarifies any questions.,1
"This guy is a donkey. I will never in my life on earth take this class again with him teaching it. He don't offer extra help In lab, you have to beg for it. He make rude comments trying to be funny. The professor takes mechanical pencils way too serious. Can't use regular pencils or pens. There was 6 people remainding out of 30 students. HEART LESS",0
"miller is beyond cool. ez A, be nice to him he is sweet. mostly wants to know what you think of his poetry he is always preparing for something! take him!!!!!!!",1
"Laura's class is extremely unorganized. She introduced a software that we were required to use a week before the end of the semester. On top of that, the assignments are tedious busy work that do not translate into additional learning. She tends to shut down questions when asked, so don't bother. She takes a difficult concept and makes it harder.",0
"Professor Adanu is a great professor and definitely wants to help his students. If you need help, be sure to stop by his office hours because he definitely wants to help you get better and create better ideas for your papers.",1
I picked her because all of the good reviews but that must be for those who had her in person. HORRIBLE for online!! Doesnt get back to you and doesnt care to give a good feedback even if you ask. Extremely hard grader and doesnt care to help you out. Would never take her class again.,0
"Probably the best teacher out there. Always looking for a way for his students to win, not just academically, but also professionally. Go see him as often as you can!!",1
Best feedback ever!,1
"Hw is myPhysicsLab, each time u get a Q wrong, it decreases your %. He will drop for attendance. Class time consists of 90% group work, before it was 100% lecture. Also, you need to read the chapter and take a reading quiz before each class on canvas imo they're hard. I wish he would go over worksheets in class more. You can use equations on test!",0
"He was my advisor and happy to say that he's also someone I email every so often to say ""hi."" His classes were very hands-on, engaging discussion, and use of multimedia. Always willing to help, always available and is an asset to RSC!",1
"Prof. Trombley is a really good prof. She is very specific in her instructions on what she wants. If you do what she asks you will have no problems passing her class. her tests are hard but not that hard. If you put you time in and actually read everything you will pass easily. Her classes are not hard, just she very particular in what she wants.",1
"I would suggest any other professor for this course. Ridiculously confusing, and as someone else stated, it's more about writing styles of papers. I didn't learn a thing. ",0
I started this class in person which wasn't too bad the lectures and the book had nothing in common so you just had to sit through lectures and participate in discussion. Due to COVID this class transitioned online and got a lot harder. He assigned papers and discussions and was strict on using key terms in discussion meaning you had to read.,1
"Super fun and educational course! As long as you turn in your easily weekly assignments and pay attention to lectures :-) Dr. Monroe will keep you awake, and the material is very interesting!",1
"This was probably the most fun class I've taken at Temple. You learn lots from somebody who's been a Mayor of a large city, but the class also has a budget simulation that allows you to learn more about politics and governing. You can be elected to a position in the Mayor's cabinet or be in City Council, write resolutions, etc. Take if you can!",1
"Dr. Kellman is very passionate about this course. Although she appears to be more of a researcher than a teacher, she made sure her course material was well organized and easy to understand. Her tests are very simple and she clearly wants everyone to do well. Definitely an interesting and relevant course, and a grade booster!!",1
"lots of note-taking, quizzes, and little assignments to turn in as well as a few annoying labs. i like him because he's so into the subject, but it was hard to take him yelling for us to speak at 8 am. also, he sighs and groans a lot during tests, which kind of drives me insane. and the tests are hard, but multiple choice.",1
"Soc 101 with Reynolds was a greeat class! He gives extra credit and will actually help you get a better grade if he sees you are trying and gives study guides. He is a very sweet and caring person and truly cares for all of his students. You do have to write a few papers, but as long as you follow his criteria, it isn't that hard to accomplish.",1
"Michael is one of my favorite professors at BU. His class has made me a better speaker and writer. He'll return any assignment to you with a *ton* of feedback, but it's because he really wants to help you improve. At the same time, he's very compassionate and respects the work you put forward. He grades most harshly on grammar and spelling.",1
"Her lectures are very boring, and her low unenthusiastic voice makes it hard to pay attention. Tests are tricky; never really tells you what to study just tells you to expect everything that has been covered so far. Sometimes would be tested on things we didn't learn. You'll have quizzes and assignments done in class also count towards attendance.",0
"Course content was interesting, but she constantly told us she was ""spoon feeding"" us, that we were lazy, not genuine and would wouldnt go anywhere in life with our work ethic. Also compared us to chinese students all the time. Would have preferred she stuck to the course material instead of constant lectures about how much we suck.",0
"Great professor. He was the man who made me decide to double major in history. His tests, as stated, have little consistency, in relation to grades, but if you speak with him, he is apt to revise them. He is one of the few professors I search out by name when registering.",1
class taken in summer no papers test are all open book even ones done at testing center but they are  difficult which is expected. Extra credit assignments are offered and I would advise you to do them for those few extra points exams do matter so try  to score high. overall the professor was ok and the tutor was very accessible which is helpful,1
I thought he was a great teacher. A little hard to understand at times but very good at explaining. He would give you the time. He tests are very hard and he expects you to put in the time to study. I found him to be very interesting. After being out of school for 22 years it was interesting! I would take him again in another science class!,1
"Found this class very refreshing in that it was mostly composed of reading the text book and then answering questions on it. No extra fat in this class, 2 group forums per semester, 3 Exams each covering a third of the classwork. Very straightforward would definitely recommend.",1
"Jason is so nice as a person and respects you as a student. As a class, it is pretty straightforward - go to class and study the PowerPoints and homework - you can score high. The labs tripped up my grade the most because the TAs are harsh graders, so just beware.",1
"Professor Faux is a great teacher. Offers lots of extra credit. Your grade is 4 exams total and your extra credit. Super easy material even for non-music people. You have to go to lecture because he does not post lecture notes online. Super easy class, he spells out exactly what you need to know. Really nice guys, cares for his students.",1
Super nice man. He knows a lot in his area but does not push it on you. He is very sweet and patient. His tests are the only grades you get but you can work in groups and they are take home. Great teacher.,1
Loves his subjects and teaches with passion. Pushes you hard. I got over my fear of speaking up in class with him.,1
"Prof. Jesilow was probably one of the best teachers I've ever had - and I'm a teacher myself, so I'm a tough judge.  Differing from the majority of his CLS colleagues, Jesilow was tenacious, unfailingly dedicated, extremely open and helpful, and genuinely kind and funny.  His grasp of the subject is, of course, expert.  Just a great guy all around.",1
"His English is beyond broken, so lectures are totally useless.  Overemphasizes pop quizzes (50% of your grade!) and I feel he enjoys to hand out extremely low grades.  His grading criteria is based on fluff - he wont be able to explain to you why he took off x points on a HW.  Overall a truly awful experience and you will suffer all semester long. ",0
WORST PROFESSOR and very arrogant... No student should have to deal with a professor like this! ,0
"I enjoyed taking Philosophy 101 with professor Pave. He is very knowledgeable on philosophy and is very enthusiastic when teaching. The textbook is difficult sometimes to understand but with any question I had, Pave was quick to answer in a way I would get it. There is a lot of writing/typing but mostly on your opinion on said philosopher.",1
"rien appris dans ce cours, trop de travaux en équipe, jai trouvé Decoste pas pire comme prof...",1
"This is an easy class. Shes very passionate about her job but tries too hard to create friendly connections with her students. This can be a bit annoying at times as she goes on long tangents. This feels nothing short of a highschool English class. Get ready to pass, its hard not to.",0
"Greatest professor ever, you'll learn so much about the real world and from his own work experiences. He makes every single class worth it, you'll look forward to every night of it, he loves to have open ended discussions and you'll never want the semester to end.",1
"Good, easy professor who doesn't grade tough. Show up to class and talk, you'll get the A.",1
"Great guy, wants everyone to do well but at the same time makes sure you improve your writing.  I have never had a prof. that improved my writing as much as him!! Its not an easy A but if you put your time in and show interest you will do well.",1
Fuentes is university status at community college level. Prepare to read and move quickly through materials. READ BEFORE THE LECTURE! and get a study group. At the end of the day you either know it or you don't and that shows on his quizzes which are fairly difficult. Read and reread. He is very funny and nice and willing to help answer questions.,1
Gail was amazing! She is very helpful and wants to see you succeed. Make sure to ask questions because she loves to demonstrate and show you how to effectively do a skill. She is very caring and wants to see EVERYONE move on from NURS 110. She loves honesty. If you make a mistake own it and tell her and she will respect you as a nurse.,1
4500 words report + 1.5 hr quiz for final. NEVER answer your question properly. Whatever you say is a complaint.,0
"1. His slide decks are awful - paragraphs c&p'd, reads directly from, few in-class examples, no excel use, no computer lab classroom 2. Projects were good, but all self-learning, easy grader 3. Final is egregious nonsense. Took full 3h for 30q, and I wasn't alone. Most material not covered, you need to self study book. Take CFA instead.",0
awesome teacher,1
"great prof, though hard to really get a clear expectation from as takes forever to mark anything.  the class itself is a cakewalk but boring, christine made it bearable",1
"500 word essay and group Skype once a week, as long as you try you will get an A. He will never respond to an email though. Just watch the weekly videos and read the papers, most are pretty interesting.",1
One of the best professors I've had by far. He is very accessible and very knowledgeable of the topics. I would take his class again in a heart beat.,1
"Dr. Israel is a very thorough lecturer. This can get a bit tedious at times, but if you pay attention, your level of understanding will be far beyond what you'll need to succeed in the class. 1-2 HWs per week on quest, which is very manageable. The best professor I've had so far at UT.",1
"Expect to put in a lot of studying.  Shes very thorough with her tests, you will need to make sure you have a deep understanding of the material.  You will rarely get a black and white answer question.  Great teacher though!  She goes the extra mile to help you if needed.  She is tough but in end you will be prepared to succeed in any class after.",1
"He's great to take for an animation class, but when you suck at drawing, you better drop the class. He is absolutely impossible to talk to outside of class, and his classroom wasn't the greatest focus environment for me, so I only attended if there was something important. He doesn't really tell you what he grades on either. Just gives you a grade.",0
"Professor Harding makes a boring topic seem pretty interesting. Solid professor and nice guy. A few short papers, 2 midterms, and a final group project. Memorize the terms from the book/lecture and you'll do fine on the exams.",1
"She made my first year at York very easy. She is a very kind person, and a great lecturer. I loved her teaching style. She made a 9 credits course a breeze!  I would recommend taking courses with Dr. Valeo.",1
"Miss class and you will not pass. She is a Pro Public Speaker and wants everything done EXACTLY how she says it. As long as you do the work, work hard for the grade you will pass the class. She is a tough grader, points deduct if you do not follow her outline. WILL NOT pass this class if you do not do your speeches. I got like 6 assignments a week.",1
"She really cares about your success in this class and does the projects with you during class so you know what you're doing. Very monotone, but she'll let you out of class early almost all the time because you're likely to finish. No homework as long as you finish your assignments in class and makes review lessons for the tests so you can get an A",1
"Professor Gill definitely makes you do more work than any other professor that offers this course. Offers some extra credit opportunities but the bottom line is that if you take her you have to struggle to get a B, where if you take anybody else you can coast by with an A. Only saying this from a STEM major standpoint and this course is required.",0
"Good lecturer. Class was a bit slow, but that wasn't he professor's fault.",1
"She is a dismal teacher- a combination of incompetence and apathy.  Never returned emails, changed requirements constantly with no warning, let the class know the criteria for grading projects AFTER submission.  I could go on and on.  BTW, she doesn't know her subject - I finally quit trying to dialogue as she just spouted her opinion as fact.",0
"Really good professor. She knows the information like the back of her hand, and is able to explain it in a way that is clear and interesting. I definitely recommend taking her HIST 104 class.",1
"Great professor, tough on the outside but wants all his students to be successful, he makes sure you have all the material needed to get a A on all exams. If you put in the effort you will do well.",1
"I was so into her class, it was so much fun. I love English, I'd always go to her office hours for help to peer edit my essay and get more feedback. She was very helpful. BUT! She is not clear with assignments, hard grader, and has no sympathy. She said I was passing then gives me a NP. She's misleading. Don't take her. Just being honest!",0
Excellent teacher. Very supportive and helpful. Wish all were like her.,1
"Mr. Goodman is a great teacher! He's pretty monotone and his lectures can get pretty boring, but it's not bad. He tries to make it fun by going to the gym every once in a while. He is extremely clear as to what he wants when he has assignments. The tests are pretty simple as long as you listen to the lectures. I never opened the book. ",1
Be prepared to work hard! Professor Bronie is very helpful and she has office hours before each class if you ever don't understand the material and need help. If you miss class you will miss out on a lot!,1
"It is very rare to find a professor who is in love with not only the subjects they teach, but also teaching itself.  Sensei Morales is one of those rare professors.  We should all be so lucky in our other classes.",1
"1. 20+ pages per elementary report, any less than that forget about getting above 80 and that's if he doesn't take off 20 points for nth like he always does. 2. Impolite, no professional attitude. 3. the most useless prof ( not sure why he is called so ) in the whole school ( so far ) 4. this dude needs to chill, it's only 1credit. AVOID and REPORT",0
she was great.  if you show her your working hard and actually care about the class she will help you out a lot!  id love to take from her again,1
"I loved this teacher. Her teaching style is great. she gives mini quizzes during class, and everything else is online. She is very clear and is there for you if you have any questions. This is an easy A if you do the work. ",1
I took him years ago at San Jacinto. I had been out of school for a long time and was never strong in math. He makes you think! You have to get past the block in your head!,1
Outstanding teacher.,1
This class is an easy A if you keep up with all the work. She assigns things every week but they're fairly simple just somewhat tedious. She gives you a whole week to complete most of the assignments. She is very kind and sweet and she will work with you as long as you do your part. She says you need the online textbook but you really don't need it,1
"Took this class last summer and it was not a pleasant experience. He hardly lectures and expects students to commit their time hours-on-end on difficult hw, online quizzes and in-class worksheets which barely reflected his simple lectures. He can get frustrated easily with struggling students too. The only upside about him is that he curves exams.",0
"I'm taking her class and I really enjoy it! She's super understanding of personal issues and is really willing to work with you if you talk with her. She gives great comments on your work which are very helpful. Not the best class, but she's a great teacher.",1
GREAT!!!,1
"He is the worst professor I have ever had.  He is not helpful, I learn absolutely nothing in that class, and I just highly suggest not taking his class.",0
She's a good teacher; presents complex material so that you can understand by relating it to our world.,1
The worst professor I have ever had. She does nothing but read word for word off a PowerPoint than grades your papers on layout not content. I haven't learned anything from her other than they let anyone teach.,0
She gives everything to you. Her study guides has all the information you need. You have to study for her class EVERYDAY for a good grade. She is very welcoming. Her office hours are great! She is amazing!!!,1
"Dr. Ranft is a great guy. However, refrain from taking his ethics class. Everything has a right or wrong answer whether or not your values are different. He loses assignments very frequently and is often late to class. His test are ridiculous and most material is from Google. If you have options, do NOT take his class!",0
"""Sexy Boy"". Killer Skies was one of the best classes I've taken. Looney kept me excited for class and did presentations effectively and with great humor. Highly recommend him in general. Online quizzes were tough but given multiple chances. Exams are somewhat hard so study. Never a dry moment, great guy, great topics. You're gonna have fun. Ciao",1
He tries to make the lectures relatable and tries to keep everyone engaged. You HAVE to read the textbook or you won't pass. You also don't need to read each chapters 3 times to get an A. Take the first test seriously bc usually everyone bombs it because everyone tries to memorize the book rather than understand the material. Solid professor,1
"As someone who struggles with math, Dr.Brown was the best choice as a teacher. He is always willing to help his students. He'll stop during class and explain something over if you need him to. There are opportunities for retakes on tests. There isn't homework or quizzes. If you put in the effort, you will pass. TAKE HIS CLASS !! (:",1
"The homework and quizzes are online, so you do not need to purchase a textbook if you do not want to. He is a nice person and can really help. I would recommend him.",1
the class helped with my understanding of the material. the professor has a personality that helps facilitate discussion. with a an interest relating to the topics of the day.,1
Mrs. V is one of the best teachers ive had at wake tech. She explains the concepts that will be on the test and the labs we completed were fun. Recommend her to all of my friends. Put forth a little bit of effort in this class and you can pull out a B if not an A.,1
Absolute worst nightmare. He brings up his past prodigies and then makes you feel like a failure if you're not like them. He is so rude and too old to be teaching this class. News is not the same as it used to be and he's very conservative. No matter how hard you work he will not appreciate it. Go to a different school if you want to be on TV.,1

Zein is probably the worst grader I have heard of. She shoots down questions in class and often rushes through classes in order to finish her lecture. Avoid getting her at all cost.,0
The best professor I have every had. Absolutely amazing.,1
"His lectures frequently meander and he repeats himself, but I don't judge his classes based on that. He assigns a really good assortment of reading topics. He's thoughtful and fair. I like it when he reminisces. Just do the required reading and you'll be fine.",1
It's a hard class because there is a language barrier but if you want it she will sit with you for however long you want. She also very much wants to share the culture and knowledge with you.,1
Worst prof ever- brought her toddler to class 3times including final exam! She expects to be accommodated but accommodates no student even if you have a learning disability. Boring classes- always starts talking about her own life for min. 1 hour every class. I tried complaining to the dept-  no reply! She should be fired. Waste of my money & time!,0
"Was very helpful, encouraging and cared very much about the students; took time to make sure that everyone understood the material. Had WebEx sessions to help the students with areas they didn't understand in the textbook.",1
Pawkett is amazing.  He knows so much and more than that he knows how to teach.  He's not a show off even tho he could be and he just makes it easy for you to understand the material.  Guitar is something a lot of people **** up and he just makes it seem so easy.,1
"She was a nice lady and the class was easy, but many assignments seemed kind of pointless. They didn't add to the understanding of the subject.",1
Amazing professor. Makes morning enjoyable and he is very detailed about his lessons.,1
"Compared to all the other physics professors that I have heard about, Oks sounds like a saint. He really was a good professor. he gave decent lectures and would answer any questions students had. Would do some demos to make lecture more interesting. Tests were multiple choice and open book, so a little challenging there. You get what you work for!",1
"AMAZING product, would buy again. I recommend this to all my friends.",1
v-ball with this guy is a beaut...love how he takes the games approach..great prof,1
Difficult to understand.  Lecture rambles and has many different topics.  Easy grader.  Really nice guy.,1
"Professor Shartin was great! It is really important that you go to all of the classes otherwise you will be so far behind you cannot catch up. The topic itself was really challenging but professor Shartin made sure that everyone was comfortable before moving on. Just show up to class, pay attention and ask a lot of questions! Good QR requirement!",1
"Laura has been an extremely understanding professor during the Fall 2020 semester. Once that has not been easy for anyone. She tried to keep class interesting by having discussions often and highly encouraging participation. If you do the readings then quizzes, lectures, labs and discussion should come easily.",1
"Brooke is AWESOME!  Explains math techniques thoroughly, in the best ways! Very passionate professor, cares about ALL students, really takes the time to make sure everyone in class is understanding the material (thats key!!) Always offering to help outside of class/give you the 1 on 1 needed. Couldn't ask for anything more in a math professor!",1
Jim is an awesome professor. He goes over everything you NEED to know for Social Work. No busy work or beating around the bush!,1
"unfair, and bias.  based most of his grading on participation and not quality of work on exams.",0
Judges when you don't understand... Not entirely sure if he understands to be honest.,0
"My feedback will be towards non music majors, I believe that his class is super cool and interesting. As long as you put effort into studying, you'll be fine. He's a kind professor so don't be afraid to ask questions. Tough in the beginning but you will transition through.",1
Katselis was one my favorite professors too. Very knowledgeable and patient. He is a sharp professor with great passion for the course. I would definitely take any course he would give.,1
"Ben is a great professor. Oftentimes academic readings can be difficult to grasp, but Ben simplified them very well during lectures. Grading is fair and lectures are engaging, Ben knows his stuff and is always willing to help.",1
Helpful and interesting!,1
PHI213 was a great class for me to learn a lot about bioethics and I'm glad I took this course with this professor! He was a real gem as a teacher and he was very considerate. He pays attention to you in class so make sure you are listening and providing feedback! He will call on you sometimes but you can tell him idk and he will let you go :),1
Great teacher. Super smart.,1

"If others' experiences in Lisa Jo's classes are anything like mine, then there are hundreds of inspired people out there who carry with them the belief that they can make a positive difference and an understanding of how. One of the very best educators I learned from in my entire life. Sign up for her classes, and get ready to think critically!",1
He is a kind professor and he goes over some pretty interesting topics. The assignments are fair and the project and essay are not too bad. Just be sure not to procrastinate. Both the project and essay take time. I highly recommend taking his class.,1
"Do not plan on getting any help because it won't happen. DO NOT Communicate through email because it's a disaster. And he is very rude, super confusing, and cant hold a conversation. Save yourself the time and do not take him.",0
"great teacher, very helpful! im a begginer in asl and i found her siging very easy to understand! she always has a lesson prepared and is never absent lol",1
"If you havent had a math class for a while, dont take her. She teaches fast and doesnt explain clearly and gets confused by her own work. Gives 1 or 2 quizzes every week , but drops lowest 2. Homework due every week , drops lowest 1. Tests are about 15 questions. Math Tutors got me through this class.",1
"This professor is the most difficult graders around! My main issue was her online discussions. She barely gives out good grades unless it's in essay form and probably proof read by a top selling author. I'm only taking this course for additional credits upon graduation, and it's the biggest mistake I've ever made! I do not recommend this professor!",1
Knows her stuff very well! Ready to help out. Particular about assignments and attendance. Overall worth taking the class.,1
"He wants to help students learn, but expects much too high a level of understanding for a 100 level class. The exams are VERY difficult (average student getting under 40%)and require a much deeper level of understanding than the homework. Harsh grader. I would avoid his class at all cost unless you can do vector calc in your sleep.",0
"Professor RIckerson is an expert in her field. She is very passionate about her subject and it shows in her lectures. Her lectures can be very long sometimes, but most of them are very intriguing. Since parts of the test are visual, it is important that you attend class. I would absolutely recommend her to anyone interested in her class.",1
"I took Prof Makedonsky at SCC. The assignments every week were clear and all the resources you needed to be prepared were provided. Get the textbook because you will need to read articles for reviews. No final exam, just a normal weekly assignment. He knew and understood that online was stressful enough and didn't add any more to that aspect.",1
Dr. Lockett is very engaging and her lectures are never boring. She always relates what we are learning to real-life situations. She is very understanding and gives you the same respect that you give her. Put in the effort and you will pass the class. She posts on Blackboard exactly how she expects the homework so it is very easy to understand.,1
"As a teacher he will get an F. He does not motivate students to learn more, he does not how to teach, and he uses an obsolete system. Not a great teacher.",0
"You always know exactly what she expects out of you. Clear guidelines and you can revise. Although, if you do the outlines that she gives you, you shouldn't have to revise much.",1
"Dr. Kraczewski was an extremely difficult professor for my particular section. This class will not receive any handouts, and he sticks to his schedule. You must attend his classes, you must read the material, and most importantly take notes. This will be the only way you can pass his course. He is extremely intelligent and has the ability to recap",1
"I loved Sara! She's blunt, approachable, and truly does care about her students and her progress. However, even though it is a vital aspect of the class and subject, I could do without the amount of volunteer work since it was personally time consuming and stressful for me. Otherwise, it's a great class!",1
"if you're an education major, TAKE THIS MAN!! he is so knowledgable about what he teaches and really cares about making sure his students become great teachers. all readings are posted on ELC and theres only 2 tests both of which are online. Im taking him again next semester and im so excited.",1
"Nice and understand but not very good at teaching online course, at all.",0
Don't even bother with this professor... if you struggle with math don't take her.,0
He is a great professor and really makes your use your critical thinking skills. Do not take him if you just an an easy A.,1
Dr. Kanchi is very caring and flexible. She takes a lot of time during her office hours to explain material and to help explain homework problems. She teaches the class in a way that helps students succeed.,1
"Good in class. Clear, easy to understand, fun. Independent studies are horrible. No direction, no syllabus, rarely shows up to meetings. I highly recommend taking a class with him as long at it's in a group!",0
One of the SMARTEST professors ive had at Salem state. He is engaging and knows a lot about business. He enjoys what he is talking about and makes it more fun and enjoyable for me as a learner. I definitely want to take a course with him again and would suggest taking him whenever you get the chance!,1
"Worse Teacher ever. I got "" B"", but he is busy talking bout his life n some other things. try to finish everything at the end.  Doesnt knw how to average out. Not good at replying back.",0
I really liked that she was willing to help students.,1
The class was overall easy do to the fact that the test review she gives before each test were a carbon copy of the test with just different number/variables. Homework was also easy but it can take lots of time to do. She came to class late numerous times and at time it seems like she didnt really care. Her teaching was also confusing most times.,0
"Just a terrible course with a terrible professor. Find another course to take or youll regret it. Poorly put together poorly executed, you have to teach yourself. Nothing gone over and lecture is on the tests just a waste of time.",0
the most unorganized professor. she gets ahead of herself too often and you have to do a peer review which means to grade other peoples homework.. pointless. she also made us have a third exam and a final in the same week (which was a 124 questions.) some of the answers on the exams didn't even have the right answers sometimes. avoid her class.,0
Mr. Luckett is a very arrogant and close minded professor. He refuses to venture outside the book thus making him one dimensional. very little assignments but he grades those assignments as if he was grading a paper due for nationals. Miss one step on his discussion rubric? expect a big ol fat 40 for the grade. i would recommend to stay away.,0
Dr. Roe is an awesome professor and is super easy to approach and ask questions. As long as you put in the effort and do the work her class is wonderful and very enjoyable.,1
"You get partial credit for written Qs on exams. Took this course over the summer and was suprisingly not as intense as I expected. I'm bad in math so I struggled with chem math, but still got a B. Turn in homework and labs and it helps ur grade A LOT. No lab practicals and TAKE HOME lab final. I HIGHLY recommend Prof. Z. Really cool guy",1
"Lisa Jo combines excellent teaching skills with years of experience in the field. Really makes you think about how the reading, videos, and assignments relate to real-world situations. Assignments can be writing-intensive but she is fair and her expectations are clearly expressed. I would take a class of hers again in a heartbeat!",1
"For me, the class was there to help broaden and sharpen my skills as a sound designer and with any class I take from Josh or when I get to work with him, I can leave learning something new and I can go to him if I'm every confused on what I'm doing (projects, life, etc.). Great teacher and if you put the time into the assignments, you're golden.",1
"semester ain't over yet,but IDC what grade I get. Dudrick is amazing. Although I always imagined a philosophy professor to be a yelling 200 year old person who uses a chalk(although he does use a chalk LoL!),Dudrick is completely the opposite. impossibly knowledgeable and caring. He can sometimes make you cringe with the jokes so be ready for that.",1
"Dr. Konen is a really nice professor that makes the lectures easy to listen to and the environment easy to be in. Attendance is non-mandatory but if you want to pass the tests, which I found to be very difficult, you need to attend the lectures and take notes. He rarely assigned homework but it was easy and I found his study guides useful.",1
what an odd man. The class is easy. 4 5-page papers due throughout the semester. Every class was about 1.5 out of the 2.5 hrs its supposed to be. He also makes food for class.,1
"He is a very clear lecturer and if you follow his advice, it will greatly improve your professional writing. Sometimes the lectures get a little dull, but pay attention because you do learn useful things. He's truly nice and cares about students' success. If you put in the work, you'll get a good grade.",1
"he's funny. presents material in a clear way, mostly go with textbook. he would suggest easy methods to approach hard situation. very clever person, matches my preference. exams are from homework, very reflective of everyday effort.",1
Best Professor ever. I love this guy. anything you need he's there and if you reach out to him he will help you get an internship. awesome guy. can't wait to take him again.,1
"I've always really struggled with math, but this class was especially difficult. I was intimidated when going to his office hours, as he is slightly rude and pretty patronizing. He went through problems too fast, and it was difficult to comprehend what he was trying to explain. When students asked questions, he belittled them. Please don't take him",0
Professor Acosta's class was difficult because I struggle with math but she made it make sense. I learned a lot in her class. She had a lot of tips on how to get through the math software for the homework. Her lectures were straight to the point.,1
"She teaches fast but class is not hard. Attendance is mandatory because there is an in class quiz almost every class but they are easy. Gives three mini-tests, get to drop lowest score. Lots of opportunities to boost your grade up. Take this class!",1
"Kathleen is a gem. So kind and truly care about her students. The class is very simple and you actually USE THE THINGS YOU LEARN!! My resume and cover letter greatly improved and I have used the cover letter i wrote for class multiple times, just changing it a bit for each job. If you are struggling just show her you care and she will be help you!",1
Marek would be easier to comprehend if he stopped taking English lessons from E.T.,0
"Best professor I've had at the Lake! She actually is very engaging of her students in her class, and teaches the material in a way that students can relate it to everyday life. Would definitely recommend her!",1
"Professor Bermudez is the best. She cares for her students and makes the class both enjoyable and extremely fair, just show up, do her work and youll almost be gauranteed and A. There are 3 papers- each is followed by an individual conference with Professor Bermudez and she gives you feedback. Great teacher 10/10 recommend you take her.",1
Pretty much just mediocre all around. No complaints but nothing special either.   Sometimes I felt that the exams were not testing what I had learned but instead were testing me ability to see through the tricks and misdirections posed in the questions.,1
Do all of your homework. ALL OF IT. Only way you'll survive. Study the chapter study guides. Only way you'll pass. Avoid if possible.,0
He's a great prof and it might be intimidating to approach him but once you do he's more than willing to re-explain things and make sure you understand.,1
Professor was super hilarious but you won't learn anything. I barely passed the class bc I dont learn anything from his lectures. He is the funniest but that doesn't help me pass the class. Maybe he should change his profession to a comedian and not a mathematician.,0
He is a very nice professor and tries to be fair to everyone! He is one of the most responsible professors I've met and the topics we learn are fun!,1
"You really have to learn it yourself. Plus, he will wait until the end of the semester to grade anything, so you have no idea where you stand in the class. However, he does curve. A lot. Big curves. Like where did that come from? Still a stressful class though.",0
"She is cool and hip. Don't be annoying, who doesn't hate annoying people.... She is a pretty easy grader, as long as you take your time you'll most likely get an A. Don't turn things in late she notices her students and doesn't appreciate it. She does however praise the good students. Makes you feel good. Great way to start my freshman year!!!",1
do not recommend her to anybody,0
"The class always acts like theyre always mad with her and she doesn't have a great rating- but I don't get it. She is respectful, very intelligent, always responds to emails, etc promptly. Few assignments and 3-4 tests, nothing too difficult. Pop quizzes, again nothing too bad. Off topic and rambles often, but not a big deal. Shes act. very sweet!",1
"I had him for comm 30, and he gives great pointers on group projects. All you have to do is do the work and participate and you will get a good grade.",1
"He was never really organized. Last semester, he planned on covering at least 10 chapters but we ended up barely doing seven. He wasted a lot of time in class fully reviewing an example from the previous lecture or trying to get the microphone to work even though we could hear him fine without it.",0
"Took ACC 3154. Doesn't use the textbook a whole lot but when he does, it's always really helpful. Fantastic prof. Would definitely take a class with him again!",1
In my opinion Jon is truly a great teacher and a good communicator.  My biggest criticism of Jon would be that he needs to keep his political view point to himself.  I don't believe it is right to use his position of authority to push his political point class after class.  ,1
"Very informative teacher, the class was very test and paper heavy, but you can still get an A without the textbook or outside readings. Lectures can be a bit dry, but the information in the slides themselves are pretty interesting.",1
"Great guy who truly cares about his students. You definitely need to pay attention, but if you are confused he will always be ready to help you. 10/10 recommend",1
Super chill!  Easily the best professor I've had so far.,1
"Dr. Day is one of the best professors at KSU. He's incredibly focused on helping students learn. His lectures can be a little dry, but his handouts and code examples are extremely helpful. He offers a ton of office hours-even on the weekends!-so that if students are having a hard time they can come to him for help. Simply a fantastic teacher.",1
She's the best lab prof I've taken at Delgado. Very sweet and always ready to help. She won't move on until you get the full understanding of the lesson. I highly recommend her bc she doesn't beat around the bush when it comes to her tests & will let you know what exactly to expect. I would definitely take her again if given the chance.,1
"Pemberton, S is far too tough in her grading of exams and assignments. Pemberton needs to realize she is not in the court room or a university class room. Avoid taking her if you are reading this.",0
"McCabe's classes are fantastic. Yes be ready to read and write papers, but you will be better for it! Participate and you will be stretched and in the end, be a better student and have a desire to want to learn more!",1
very easy to co-operate with,1
Professor Waller is one of the best instructors I've had in my entire college history. She is approachable & respectful. She answers questions & provides great explanation. She had us do a lot of simulation & practice tests which were so helpful! her tests are fair & she spends time analyzing them & throwing away certain questions. she's amazing!,1
"Gail will forever be one of my favorite professors. She is kind, brilliant and has a beautiful way of teaching tough material.",1
She was an amazing professor she was cheerful and focused on what we needed from her to pass the class. Definitely recommend :),1
This guy rocks.,1
"This professor is a treasure trove of experience and knowledge in Social Work. A few other students have said that she can come across somewhat intimidating or difficult to read. However, I have found her to be a very caring and precise individual. Get ready to be consistently prompted to explain your understanding in your own words.",1
"I enjoyed the Fundamentals of Networking class with Professor Wade. I took the class online, and I found the online lectures to be entertaining and useful. I actually felt like part of the class. Professor Wade seems laidback but also knows the material he is teaching and has a lot of real world experience, which is good for a Networking class.",1
No Comments,1
Dr. Birkett uses quizzes to help her students gain success. This course is a blended learning course and is easy to follow along. Show up to class and put an effort into the work and you will be fine.,1
She gives good lectures - a lot of detail- but her tests are so difficult! She uses very obscure quotes and themes.,0
"As a grad student taking this class, I should say, I have never met a professor like this. He showed great experience in every course he teaches, and also perfect explanation for every question arising. Hope I could be his class assistant some semester in future.",1
"Mr. Brooks is a very good teacher. Although, if you do not want to learn I do not recommend taking his class. There is a heavy workload but it pays off in the end. I learned more in Mr.Brooks class than I did in 12 years of school. I recommend taking his class.",1
"It;s fine to take. However, get ready to put your extra effort to do well in class.",1
"Professor Rarick is my favorite professor at UT. He's funny, caring, and was always willing to make appointments for extra help. I had zero stats experience and did just fine because of this wonderful man.",1
"Are you looking for an awesome English professor? well look no further because you have found her. Mrs. Jessica Zbeida is my favorite college professor! You have a total of 4 writing assignments. She is very sympathetic and understands that life happens. Show up and pass, that's it. Did I mention that shes awesome?",1
"Lisa is one of Coe's most amazing professors!  She makes the topics fun, intersting, and learnable.  Not too hard, not too easy, really funny, can't say enough about her!  Take her class!",1
Dr Scoville is one of my favorite professors because how much he wants his students to succeed. He genuinely cares about each of his students and will work personally with each one to ensure they succeed. Someone who finds joy in teaching others and is excited by the material which makes taking his class interesting and useful.,1
"TAKE HIM! One of Howard's best. He is hilarious and extremely knowledgable about the topics we cover. It is an easy A, but still take the time to get to know him because he's awesome and a joy to talk to. I will definitely be taking him again.",1
He is the best. The best lecturer in TRU. I highly recommend him.,1
"I have enjoyed Dr. Goldman's class so far. It is mildly difficult, with a few short papers and a presentation required. I've really enjoyed our class discussions so far and I love that she is unafraid to touch on some of the more controversial topics surrounding her subject matter.",1
"This class was fun and insightful.  Mrs. Spencer was inspiring and enthusiastic, never a dull momment! It also led to an internship with a wonderful company, that has now landed me a full time position in the field of my major! Also, I previously took Mrs. Spencer for an accounting class, and I give the same rating. EXCELLENT INSRTUCTOR!",1
Her feedback is terrible and her grading is the hardest I have ever experienced.  She is unreasonable in her grading practices and does not take responsibility for her own errors. I will never take another class instructed by her again.,0
The tests are extremely difficult but Bricker is a good professor and you can tell that she's passionate about what she is teaching when she lectures. There are also plenty of other assignments that will allow you to bring your grade up (including extra credit) so that you don't have to worry about poor exam grades causing you to not pass.,1
"The below is IMO. Pros: - Probably knows everything about physics and math - Fair grader/tester - Drills overlooked but necessary areas, like notation - Available Criticism: - Needs a larger whiteboard - Needs more theory in lectures You 110% must be self-motivated to succeed in Dr. Howell's class. His teaching style prioritizes reinforcement.",1
"I could go on for pages about what an amazing professor Bill is; I just registered to take my 4th class with him! He lectures a lot, but his lectures are engaging and personal. He genuinely cares about each of his students and wants to see them succeed. Exams are lecture-based so attendance is important, but he is very understanding of circumstance",1
"I've taken Carlton for 3 semesters now, I just sit in on his class at this point cause it's awesome. The class basically becomes a little writing community who will discuss their work in a constructive and non judgemental environment, with a few fun writing exercises thrown in each class.  Carlton's funny and he enjoys his students and their work.",1
"McKenna is by far my favorite professor. He wants his students to know about the real world and his lectures are extremely interesting. Do the papers, watch the videos, and study his review and you'll get an A.",1
"Her lectures can be very confusing, and her extremely poor handwriting doesn't help at all. Because of that, quizzes were pretty hard. But if you study on your own and pay attention in the lecture class, it makes the class a little easier. Brittney is super nice and fun to talk to though. Cool person. Mediocre teacher.",0
"I would not recommend Professor Jewell to anyone. She does not teach much or give  helpful information, or relevant information. She loses papers and gives you a zero grade. Doesn't help with research paper assignment - you're on your own. Doesn't answer emails and is not accessible to students.",0
Erika is a great teacher. She kept our class going and we had a 3 and a half hour class. She is very intelligent and I enjoyed every minute of her class!! ,1
He might be pushy but he makes the class fun,1
"His lecture consisted of him scribbling incomprehensibly all over the board.  All learning was done entirely from the text, as he did not instruct in any sort of clear way.",0
"I love Professor Tompson. She really cares about her classes and is overly animated during 8 AM lectures. She is the only professor I know who always has the first row full of students eager to learn. Her tests are easy and she asks questions in a way that makes sure you understand the information, but they aren't trick questions. Would take again!",1
"Very easy class the only thing you need to worried about is the quizzes, the two mid terms, and the paper which is easy. For the quizzes I would highly suggest you bring some type of voice recorder  because when he goes over the quiz the class before, he talks kind of fast...but its a pretty easy class.",1
"The first couple of papers he assigns are confusing. Throughout the course it gets easier. Good note taking skills are important as he explains what he expects from students. Lectures are confusing sometimes but it you take notes and ask questions it will be helpful. Very little homework is assigned, go to his office hrs. Great professor!",1
"His tests were almost impossible unless you reallllly understand Physics.  If you made a 7.5/15 on the test, you had a A.  The stuff on the tests isn't covered in class.  I would recommend taking someone else!",1
"Dr. Weiner is a tough guy to figure out. He can be totally charming and kind, but with the flip of a switch, he can be a real ass.I got stellar grades in his class with the exception of one grade and he failed me because I didnt ask him about the status of my grade (even though it was all on blackboard). Stay as far away from his class as possible",0
"She is both knowledgeable and informative. She works hard and expects students work hard too. She has a positive attitude and always in a good mood. In the first encounter, she seems a bit strict, but she is not. You can get grade ""A"" in her class if you do your homework, but there is a lot of homework. Also, there is no extra credit for this class",1
"Marks is a good, knowledgeable prof. He let me off the hook once with a late paper when I screwed up and printed the wrong copy. Don't take this class if you struggle with Spanish, though--he's a little condescending when you ask questions and makes you feel like an idiot. But if you know your stuff, you'll get an A in here. It's grammar review.",1
"Great teacher! I had him as my micro professor for my 1st term as a freshman. He made the course very durable and easy to understand. Just as a warning, he gives his exams a heavy weight so if you do poorly on one of them your grade might suffer a little bit. However, even still, as long as you pay attention in class & do your hw you will be fine",1
"Best professor I've had by a long shot. He's very clear and makes sure you understand the material before he moves on. He's always willing to give you extra help outside of class when he's there. If you pay attention and do the homework, the exams are a piece of cake.",1
"I'm a good student & receive good grades. Even though I was interested in the material and ready to learn he made this class unbearable. He is very strict, unforgiving, rude, and gives a horrendous amount of busy work. He's a Christian (you can see his cross necklace through his chest hair) and is bias against the other religions in his lectures. ",0
There is quite a bit of homework to complete out of the books. Keep up on it and you will get a good grade. She is fair and nice. I did recommend her for a class.,1
"If you just want to take the course, yes he's a generous grader. If you want to do some research, you should rethink about it",0
"O.k. classes, has her own favorites though.",1
Interesting lectures with some class activities to help understand theories. Tried to get the class involved by asking questions and encouraging us to ask questions.  Gives extra credit when you need it. Really cares about her students.,1
"Micah is very smart, there is no doubt that he knows what he is talking about when it comes to design and typography. And although he is HILARIOUS when it comes to sarcasm & dad jokes, sometimes I struggled & probably took his sarcasm too personally. I was convinced & I still think that he can't stand me--But who knows? That could just be me.",1
"Chemistry is naturally a hard class but Kiesewetter knows what she's doing. Her lectures are very organized, clear, and helpful and her teachings are coherent and understandable. The homework are very helpful for exams. There are four exams and a final but if you honestly dedicate your time to this with her teachings you will come out successful.",1
Mrs Hubbard is one of the best teachers I have ever had. She truly enjoys teaching and takes every opportunity to provide helpful information or learning experiences. She cares about her students and is passionate about women's health. Take advantage of having her as a teacher and really get to know her or you will miss out!,1
"Dear Black Students, DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE. Unless you want to sit in a 3 hr night class and listen to your classmates demean us. If you can handle that then its a super easy A. But if youd like to keep your peace of mind. STEER CLEAR. Discusses black topics. Without the discussion. Great for your gpa, horrible for your mental stability.",0
I was warned not to take Smith but I decided to do it anyway and it was a mistake! His lectures are so long and dry and makes the material more confusing. The final is 70% of your grade and sometimes it's unclear what type of answers he's looking for. Avoid and take this class with a different prof if you can !,0
"Took Intermediate swimming and was pretty easy because I swam in high school. Class focus is mainly on drills, you will do a lot of them every single day, so attend class. Online modules and a final exam(pretty easy if you showed up to class). Played water polo on last day and professor joined in to help the losing team. ",1
I hate her teaching style. She uses MyMathLab.com and she expects everyone to know what they're doing. The homework is pretty hard. If you take this class you might as well sign your life over to math homework because it takes HOURS..,0
Nice guy but horrible class. His grading system is ridiculous! Lectures are a bore. Would not recommend..,0
"Professor Bush creates his own version of Torts so you cannot look to any outside material. You do not have to read. All you need is a bush bible for the final. However, this is not enough to do well because he is a picky grader and it is hard to know what exactly he wants. It is kind of a toss up in the end. Overall I did like him as a person.",1
"Extremely student-friendly & helpful, always wants students to understand concepts. Replies to emails all the time & very approachable during office hours. posted previous years' exams to help prepare better. cares about his students, explains difficult concepts with models.",1
he hates everyone,0
"There were 30 students in the beginning of the class and two weeks later there's only 7 students. Most students dropped because of the workload and it was so bad that the department head noticed and made her talk with us on how to fix the class. If you want to read a lot of useless text and fail a class, then you should take this class. Don't do it",0
"Interesting topics, awesome professor. Draper is definitely among the best of the sociology department faculty. Consistently fair grading and clear guidelines made this course one of my favorites. Exactly what a great college class should be.",1
I love Dr. Ortega! He is so nice and caring and you will learn so much from him. His accent is not difficult to understand and he is always there for office hours. He is an amazing professor that loves what he does and is very passionate. He is a caring person and will give extra points to help the class when they need it. Definitely recommend him!,1
Awful. Grading is way too tough. He thinks hes teaching at Harvord. Didnt care when someone called him out for being unfair. Accused me of plagerism when I only used my own words in a paper. Never posts online. Expects you to have Einsteins memory skills with his pop quizzes. This professor is the worst ive ever had.,0
"She is a little crazy and tends to go on about her personal theories and views a lot,but these can be interesting.the exams are never on those things so don't bother trying to keep up and write them down.the exam questions are way too advanced for the level of the class.however,she gives huge curves!study book and her general notes and u'll b fine",1
No Comments,1
One of the best professors I have encountered. He taught extremely well and got me very interested in his subject. But need to attend all his classes as his exams/assignments are based on what he teaches in class. Very helpful. Course recommended for anyone who wishes to make the most out of his teachings!,1
"This course can be very time consuming, but if you listen to the lectures and take notes you will do fine.",1
"This class drove me NUTS! He teaches so slow, and goes over so manny things that you should've learned years ago that I couldn't hardly stand sitting through class. He also wrote down the problems on the board wrong more than he got them right. We had to show him how to solve the problems most of the time. Mostly we students had to teach eachother.",0
Professor Blackburn is fantastic! He really helped me stay motivated and worked with me to extend assignment deadlines after I lost my job. He really cares about his students.,1
"The only grade's that you will get for this class are test grades, so make sure you're a good test taker. Also, she often goes off-topic and expects you to remember things that she has said only once.",0
Ben has a knack for his subject and a great way of teaching it. He'll always make time to help you as well. Absolutely recommend!,1
"He is a good guy, means well, and is approachable but the amount of material is absurd. He does alot of rambling and its impossible to pay attention to him and he isnt great at covering the material in class, and there are readings every class. Study guides are helpful but they have questions and you could answer them and not know if theyre right",1
You think it is an easy class until he piles all of the stuff at the end.  An alright teacher.,0
"This was an online course.  What was expected was very clear, and communication and grade posting was prompt.  From what I just gathered through email, he seems like a nice guy.",1
"Although he only teaches BA101 he really cares for his students. Very personable, lectures are interesting, stories are funny, and just an all around great guy. Take his class, you won't regret it.",1
"Dr Sam, knows how to explain for everyone to understand especially in the Lab. He takes time to show everyone the parts and make sure we all understand him. If you follow up and attain all his Classes, then be ready to do well in test and exams.",1
"ECON 227 was a train wreck on the administration side (lost exams, grades never coming back, etc.), but KMack cares a lot about his students. If you go to class and put in enough practice before his exams, you're very likely to get an A (plus you get to hear his awesome bagpipe playing at the end of each semester :D ).",1
"I lived at office hours, which I would never go to before.  After taking his course, the next semester seems so easy. Quit your job and dump your girlfriend if you want enough time to learn.  The Thermo book is worth its weight in gold.  Metgalchi is a genius, but the TA was an idiot.",1
LOVED this class!! AWESOME!!!,1
"This professor is authentic, intellectual, and concise. If you ask him to repeat things, he will gladly and happily repeat if you don't catch on the first time as long as you are willing to stay on top of the concepts. great mentor, solid instructor, rutgers you would be foolish to let a gem like this teach elsewhere!",1
"I took a psych class with Al and enjoyed it! Hes quirky and funny and always made the class laugh. Lectures were pretty boring (80 minutes of straight notes) but he was laid back which I liked. Overall a pretty easy class. If you take notes, study for the tests, and do your assignments, youll be fine! Id take more classes with him in the future.",1
Barcley is definitely a professor of a different breed. He is very entertaining during class and extremely helpful whether in class or out. He pushes you to join competitions and classes that can make you a better entrepreneur. He offers credit for IDK as an answer to test questions and allows you to write your own test question. Inspiring!,1
Dr. Mike is such a wonderful professor. He has a very dry sense of humor but he really knows what he is talking about. He also understands that we are not taking this class to master physics and often complains about how awful the course is set up. He really tries to help you out and sympathize with you. I highly respect him as a lecturer.,1
"If you really want to learn, dont take this class. She teaches the class like if its a middle school math class. She moves on to fast and doesnt make the lessons clear and understandable. So much homework . Horrible math professor",0
"I took him for Calc II, and would not recommend him if you're going on to take Calc III. I need Calc III and I do not feel prepared at all. I taught myself almost everything I learned in this class because he does not give good lectures. Not many notes, lots of example problems.  If you end up taking him, read the book before going to each class.",0
"Way to much work, its a Gen Ed class and he treats it like a senior level philosophy class. He told us all we needed to do was the reading and i still did bad on the exams even though i read all the material. he gave me no helpful advice on how I could improve. I had to drop because I was putting off my other 4 classes just to get Ds on his exams.",0

Loved this class!,1
Take a class from her at your own risk.  She is very confusing and hard to learn from.  You will be learning everything on your own.  She is unwilling to help students.  Also her test are written in a very confusing style.  I would say try and find another instructor if you can.,0
The best teacher that I ever had in my academic life.,1
"I had him for an online Religion 101 class and he was extremely clear on what he expected. He is very organized and provides feedback for every assignment. Religion is an interesting class, but does require a lot of reading. If you don't mind learning and have an interest in religion, he's a solid choice.",1
"Professor Choi, (NOW BAEK, because of marriage), amazing professor, lectures are so clear, no-book, very, very clear notes, relates the subject to real life situations. Homework is assigned, but you get the solutions, so take very good notes! they're tests and a final exam, kinda forgot whether we had a midterm or not but I don't recall taking one",1
"The best teacher I have ever had (knowledgeable, caring, logical). Highly recommended.",1
"If you want a class where there are not many assignments and class is interesting everyday with good class discussions, this is the class for you. I had no homework and two tests . My favorite class by far.",1
I had Dr. Wisner for an online English class over the Summer (my first ever college class) and he was wonderful! Would definitely take again.  He gives great feedback and responds to emails very easily.  Each essay (there are four 700-1000 word essays) comes with rubrics which makes it easy to read.  Don't forget to check out the book!,1
"Heard many great things about this professor and was excited to take her, but the class is completely different online than it was in person. She made the tests harder and gave us old practice tests to study off but was not helpful. I understood the material from her teaching but if you do bad on the exams you will not pass the class.",0
"The best experience you can have learning a foreign language. If you're seriously interested in learning the language, his class will be the favorite part of your day. Highly recommend - no question!",1
"Professor France is amazing! She is a very lenient professor and gives a very manageable workload. She is very clear on her instructions for assignments and if there is something that is unclear, email her. She is very attentive to her emails and responds within 24 hours. If I needed to take more English courses, I'd take her.",1
"Dr. Jaja is a great professor and if you study and look over lectures you'll pass her exams, because most of what is on the exams she covers in class. She is willing to work with you if your struggling and she really cares about her students. Those leaving negative feedback are likely the ones to expect an A just for showing up.",1
"Personable professor but the way she teaches is awful. Did not have a course outline, made up assignments along the way and did not stay on course topic enough. Always late and was a tough grader in a course that was meant to be a grade booster. She asked us what we wanted to have for assignments during the class. Multiple things due at same time.",0
This class is the reason why I am a better writer than I was in high school. Tom cares so much about his students and truly wants them to succeed. This is by far one of the hardest classes I have ever taken but I wouldn't have wanted to take it with anyone else.,1
"Bloody brilliant. He knows how to keep class interesting. You need to actually do your reading, but I personally found the reading assignments (if not overwhelming at times) incredibly interesting. He's also extremely helpful in his advice on how you can improve your writing style and class work.",1
I have her this semester for HED 200 very frustrating does not give any material related to the lectures for exams.,0
"Amazing professor, very clear with her instruction. Not difficult, but not an easy A by any means. If you are confused she will take the time to explain it again. If you are a comm major I highly recommend her, she is top notch. It helps to read the text prior to class and whatever she lectures on will most likely be on the midterm and/or final.",1
Burkes class was awesome!,1
Insanely good. Never thought math could be taught so well.,1
DO NOT TAKE THIS MAN FOR STOR435. JUST DON'T DO IT YOU WILL HAVE TO LEARN EVERYTHING ON YOUR OWN AND HE GIVES A HOMEWORK DUE EVERY CLASS PERIOD. He cares not at all about teaching this class,0
"He goes through the material very quickly. Class was relatively pointless except to turn in homework (which is graded!) Review sessions were pointless, and the previous exams he posts are nothing like the exams he gave my class. He is a nice enough guy, but you have to ask specific questions if you expect any help from him.",0
I strongly recommend NOT taking him. He is one of the most inflexible professors I've ever had. He preached all semester about how open minded he is and how he is willing to work with you but its all just facade. He calls people out in class for not talking but then bashes your opinion when you do. He's just straight up rude.,0
Your textbook is a set of drawings from a building on campus. He is genuinely interested in students success in class and industry.,1
please do not take his course he is not helpful at all and will not help you in anyway belong. he is so boring,0
LOVED this Prof I wish I could take her again for more classes but she is moving,1
"Quizzes before class not on Sundays. No class on test days and its online so you can use notes. Yellowdig sucks. Show up to class for participation/group activity points. Get ready to speak in front of class all the time. There's a group project. Easy class, but the teacher is kind of meh...",1
"I wish I started taking his classes sooner, he is very good and knows his stuff.",1
"Great professor. Keeps lectures entertaining with his dry sense of humor, and tests are very manageable. Highly recommend this class.",1
"Good lectures, a lot of note taking. Be prepared to write fast. Ask her to slow down and she will. Puts everything you need to know on the slides. Tests weren't too bad and they are also curved. The lowest test score is dropped as well. My only complaint is she does not put notes online. Overall good professor and interesting class. Learned a lot.",1
"Brown is the worst professor probably to walk the planet. He doesn't give two craps about his students. Four tests make up 95% of your grade. His lectures do not make any sense, as he gets side tracked VERY easily. He makes a confusing topic even more confusing, never answers emails, and overall is just very rude.",0
"Dr. Jones helps inspire students as writers looking to make a difference in the community and is extremely helpful in every way. She cares about each individual student dearly and see great potential in everyone. The class was fun, if you chose a topic you were seriously passionate about. I would take any other classes she teaches here at BSU.",1
Prof. Jackson is the best! She was very encouraging and helpful. Whenever I had a question for clarification on an assignment she would never make me feel stupid for asking (unlike some professors at GCC). Definitely recommend!,1

This class was one of the most disorganized classes I have ever been in.  She tells you one thing and does another or marks in another way.  I don't recomend this class to anyone.,0
"Love this woman's approach on acting.  In Acting I she doesn't expect you to be great, she expects you to improve and try to grow.",1
"Dr. Schnittjer has a reputation for being a difficult teacher. (Something which he seems to be proud of) I wouldn't mind that if his difficulty was actually beneficial for learning, rather than just for the sake of being difficult. Dr. Schnittjer is a kind and very intelligent person. But, he is trivially particular about minor things in grading.",0
"Extremely disorganized professor: lost 100 quizzes (grades never returned), never has enough handouts/quizzes to give students when he needs to, forgets his calculator or other things and makes us waste time. This professor seems completely clueless and it isn't fair to have such professors at University.",0
"Sam was the best professor I had in my first semester of college and I wasn't even that interested in the Linguistics department. I'm a film major, but Sam's energy and passion about the topic made it much more interesting to learn about and go into more depth. Would love to take another class with him",1
"I took her field experience class and it was good! We discussed about the importance of public history. She's a Jewish woman from the East coast and gives interesting information about Jewish holidays like Rosh Hashanah and that we had no class for it, I'm Christian but thanks for the free day off!",1
Easy A. Had online quizzes and speeches. Online quizzes have unlimited amount of chances and it takes the highest score. Speeches were easy just follow the grading rubric.,1
"Hes a great professor! His class was never boring and you learn a lot from him as far as theatre and life. You have to a video critique every week thats just a page long, go see 2 plays and write a critique, and do a few simple assignments here and there. There isnt a book so you have to show up & take notes by they are really simple.",1
"Ning is difficult, nigh impossible to learn from.  He outright lacks the ability to communicate ideas clearly,  does not set clear expectations or plans for his course, jump from topic to topic while teaching, repeats himself over and over again (and not in a helpful way) and just appears to be doing the absolute minimum required as a teacher.  ",0
I took this class as an elective and glad I did. Prof. Morra made it interesting and the work was a reasonable amount for an upper level class. The discussions were interesting.,1
"She is very helpful, and she really knows what she's doing. Also, she is hillarious. Only thing is she is a tough grader.",1
"Very nice professor, difficult lecture to understand, however, he makes it easier. Take home tests, multiple attempts and untimed.",1
"all you have to do is write papers. They dont even have to be good. You'll probably get an A on the paper, if he remembers to grade them. the lowest grade i ever got on a paper was a 92, but he forgot to grade one of my papers so it went in as incomplete and i almost couldnt have english 112. It eventually got turned into an F and i recieved a B.",0
The class component in this course wasn't bad it was pretty straightforward math. The labs on the other hand were the complete opposite. The midterm was even worse he literally tested us on the smallest things from our labs and then to top it off gave the LONGEST integration question known to man as the final question!!!!,0
"He is sarcastic but never mean, its just his sense of humor. Very clear and helpful, but you need to reach out if you want help. Good at explaining things and gives good practice questions. Tests are straightforward and don't trick you. Chem is difficult, but he wants to help you understand. Follow the book and come to class and you will be fine.",1
"Falcon was an amazing professor, he is very intense but will change the way you think about the world. And he really genuinely cares about all of his students, he will spend time outside of class to discuss class topics you may be unclear on. Falcon is open about who he is and makes real connections to students. Just do the homework, and reading.",1
"He is a very tough grader but I can appreciate that because he actually prepared me for ""the real world"". Plus, it was a GRADUATE course, you have to work for it. I learned so much! I thought I was a great writer and I was HUMBLED real quick, thank you for that because now I AM a great writer and have progressed so much just within this course.",1
Awesome teacher! Very funny!,1
"Pete is a fantastic teacher. I took his class that had to switch to online, and he made sure to work with all of us and ensure we understood everything and were doing as well as we possibly could. Super cool professor. If you need a math class, I'd highly recommend him.",1
"I didn't get the feeling that this professor wanted me to learn japanese. It almost seemed like it annoyed her. Her quiz's and tests were pretty easy if you study. Watch out for her final, she made us do a oral presentation timed. Studying Japanese is my passion and I felt that her class took away a lot of that passion. Be ready to talk a lot in cl",1
"In my opinion, she took a ridiculous amounts of points for items graded and was clearly unfair in her grading.  Her grading comments were very unclear. An example, post 2 responses for discussion boards to meet the minimum requirements. The she takes a point because you only posted two.  How can you take points for meeting requirements?",0
Instruction was awkward. Bo reads directly from the slides offering vague answers to students' questions. Online homework is tedious and time consuming offering little explaination.  Two group projects were riddled with busy work.  Weekly posts for online discussion forum was insightful for financial current events.  Final exam held in class.,0
"Dave is an awesome man. He is so kind and willing to help his students. His lectures can get a little boring, however, he makes it worth it. Be prepared to read a lot and memorize terms. There 3 exams total, no final. His exams are fairly easy if you attend his class and study. If you are considering to take BA101, try and get him!",1
"Lots and lots of boring lectures, makes bad jokes throughout the school year, easy pass other than that didn't really learn anything",0
"The worst teacher I've had. If this is your first time taking a college class talk to your advisor and make sure you don't get her. Incredibly vague in her directions and gets upset when you ask for clarification, just citing the directions again. I went into this class with a passion for writing. Not so much anymore. Way too hard for English 101",0
"Professor Shimko is an incredible lecturer but he doesn't mess around. My advice: show up to class every time, take hand-written notes, read the articles so you get a good participation grade, the TA is your bff - they grade the exams, and DO NOT PROCRASTINATE YOUR FINAL PAPER like I did- it's the one thing Shimko actually reads and grades",1
"Bill is an awesome professor. Very very interesting and made OB very applicable to the workplace. If you do bad in his class, it's because you deserve it. Probably one of the smartest and most equitable professors I've ever had",1
Great professor.  He gets right down to business. Be sure to stay for the entire class...he checks role at the end of the period. ;),1
"She was one of the best BIO professors I have had online. She has a easy to follow online course, gives two tries, and provides lots of feedback on the papers. Read the syllabus and know it . Just make sure you do your work on time. I think the other students who complain is because they are late with the assignments (she does not like that).",1
"Very straightforward and relaxed lecture style. He is also very responsive to emails. Tests are fair and usually based on notes/homework/labs. The labs can be challenging, so be sure you get a good group! Would highly recommend this professor; he has been one of my favorites.",1
I actually retook this class because I had missed a lot of online homework so I was confused when the teacher was a different person. But I'm really happy I retook it because I got to learn so much more and from a neurologist's perspective instead!! If I had questions she'd give me great answers and she was really passionate about her subject.,1
"HCI is my best class in csumb ! she is the best , she is smart , visionnairy , clear and amazingly generous . i really wanted to take another class with her.",1
Best teacher and the absolute best advisor at NKU! Take him for any class you will have fun,1
"I really dont understand all the negative reviews for Dr. Misurda. His lectures are amazing and he is passionate about the subject material. If you dont wanna learn, dont take his course. If you do wanna learn, hes the professor for you. He goes very deep into the material. Outside of class his email response time is the quickest I've ever seen.",1
"He is really nice, enthusiastic, passionate and knowledgeable. Lot of writing and reading. First two assignments are group projects which make up 30% of your grade. He has everyone fills out a survey after the project is complete and he adjusts each persons grade. you can raise your final grade by 1/3 by writing more than the 7,001 in your journal",1
He is one of the worst professors you can imagine. Talks more about politics than physics. Stay away from this professor if you are actually looking to learn.,0
"He's extremely rude for no reason. He always has an attitude, and teaches horribly!! You can barely understand what he says and if you ask a question he answers sarcastically. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND HIM! HE IS HORRIBLE!!!",0
"Dr. Avila is an amazing chemistry professor. She goes above and beyond to make students feel comfortable asking questions and to make sure they learn the material. She offers a lot of extra credit, so take advantage of it! With chemistry, you either know it or you don't so you have to learn it to pass!! I highly recommend taking her!",1
"Unorganized.  Late.  Makes unrealistic demands - she had to cancel projects and parts of projects because she doesn't know how to make a schedule for summer.  Makes her religious beliefs known, and she's judgmental.  Refuses to talk about controversial topics due to her own beliefs.  Must rely on book for info, attendance required.",0
"She is a great professor. Easy to understand, explain everything until her student get the material. Respect everyone equally, very kind and sweet",1
"Lectures can wander a little, but the content is good and hes decently engaging. The concepts I learned in this class were some of the most interesting in my undergrad. The exam is pretty reflective of what he mentions in lecture, so take notes. As long as you work hard on the paper and go to class youll get a good mark.",1
"I think she was my favorite instructor this semester. She provides examples of each dysfluency during lecture, and she makes it VERY interesting. Her first test is probably the most difficult out of all of them, and it isn't even that hard. She definitely wants to see you succeed, and helps you as much as she possibly can!",1
"WONDERFUL Prof. Really cares about us, gives so much extra time even outside of class itself! even online! real sweet lady. with that said - not an easy A, the test are sometimes quite difficult if you dont put yourself into it. Still, worth it. You actually learn.",1
Don't take class unless you are really interested in the course material. There is a lot of reading and writing. Random in class quizzes so reading is necessary (2 books and lengthy articles) and at least four 5 paragraph essays. She is very nice though and honest.,1
"Steve is very thorough, and it's easy to fall behind if you're not all in. Weekly quizzes based on readings aren't all tough, but one or two wrong answers can bring an A down to a B or a C. Show that you're trying, be attentive, and try to speak in class and Steve will go out of his way to help you if you need it.",1
Thad is seriously the best! I wish he was full time so he had more time for his students. Lecture exams are graded instantly- lab exams can take a couple weeks. He makes online lab quizzes which is nice. Gives good analogies and is really funny so it makes the material easier to learn. Gives study guides that are just like exam. Cummalitve final.,1
"Disorganized; no review for tests unless you continuously plead.  Barely used my lab manual; get ready to do alot of self study because teaching is not his strong suit although he is knows his stuff.  And yes, he yells at students and caused alot of anxiety among students in class.",0
"She is a teacher who is very passionate about her students success. She will give you plenty of time in class to ask questions, and will move at a nice pace so everyone can feel like they are learning something. I wish I could take her next semester! ",1
This class is an easy A if you follow her grading rubric. She goes over the assignments in detail and if you have a question she makes sure you understand it. There is also lots of extra credit opportunities.,1
"Professor Leikind is a nice guy, who is really passionate about science. He knows his subject very well, but let me describe why I would not take him again if I had to. You need to do 2 quizzes every class even on exam days and read the chapter before class, which is about 15-25 pages. If youre not really interested in physics, its not for you.",1
Professor Bush is always accessible out of class and loves to teach. He has his own language that he expects his students to learn and doesn't teach most of the necessary elements of Torts for the bar. Exam is doable (open book) but it was really a toss up because he is a picky grader.,1
"Prof. Morra is wild. He's funny in all his lectures and keeps you entertained. Exams and final are minimum 12 pg papers. You have to start essays WAY before the due date to finish on time cause they're long. Can type them straight from your notes and get an A. Show up, takes notes, pass. Can skip a few times but you'll miss notes. Sports fan too",1
"He puts things in the simplest terms, no beating around the bush. He is a character and will explain things as many times it takes for you to understand. Very patient, very caring teacher. He is willing to give extra credit as long as you show interest in the class and participation. I highly recommend him. Speaks English/Spanish.",1
Awesome prof! Professional but with a good sense of humor. Expects you to learn a lot but is helpful and understanding. Didn't require a textbook!,1
Very good teacher and he is also very funny. Pay attention in class and study even a little bit and you'll be more than fine.,1
"If you can avoid taking her online course, then do so. She was one of the worst professors I've ever had. You have a self intro video at the beginning of the year and then an informative speech at the end & if you suck @ giving speeches your grade will suffer. The rest of your grade is easy because it's ""quizzes"" from the reading.",0
"Overall, a good professor. She's very approachable and wants to help in any way she can. With that said, she makes you work. It's a flipped classroom so it's up to you to make sure you watch the video lectures. Quizzes are hard (1-2 per week), but similar to classwork. Exams are very fair. Tough course, but she does everything she can to help!",1
"A fantastic professor. She's very caring and understanding, and as long as you do the work she'll work with you. Organized, passionate, and all around very helpful. Would definitely take a class with her again.",1
Incredibly easy class.  He is more then willing to help you and does whatever he can to prevent you from failing.  Great teacher and a fun guy to listen to.,1
"Prof. Collins is awesome. Very smart, very caring, very intentional.",1
I graduate from this program in 2014 and just had to come back to mention that 3 years later and I still resent this man and his attempt at teaching.,0
SO hot,1
"Her lectures consisted almost entirely of reading to us the concepts from the book that were going to be on the test.  Reading them.  Word for word.  And repeating them for those who did not have time to write it down the first time, even though it was right there, in the book.",0
"Hansen is the best professorinstructorteacheretc. I've absolutely ever had. I've taken three classes with him (ENGL 301 and ENGL 455 twice with varying material) and I've loved all of them and hope to take more before I graduate next semester. He's a genius, he's quick-witted, funny, and a really quality professor. Take him every chance you get.",1
"Kate Darling is a great instructor dont get me wrong. However, you have to do your assignments to what she is looking for, NOT what the criteria is asking for. It has to be her way, or your wrong. Even if it says otherwise in the text. She is very old school when it comes to teaching and grading. If you figure that out early, you'll do great!",1
"Professor Klatzke is a wonderful lady. I took her for Organizational Communication and enjoyed the class very much. She expects students to be enthusiastic about the material but does not go overboard with homework, attendance, or harsh grades. The group project was alot of fun, and if you have any problems she will help you undoubtedly.",1
"He is nice enough and discussions can be lively. However, this class shouldn't be required for anyone 25 or older.  Assignments and due dates are not clearly defined (they don't match the syllabus). ""Do a writing on metacognition"". Ok, what about it? Specifics would be nice. Too many papers to write overall, got tiresome. Also, don't buy Outliers.",0
"She is not for those who are not passionate about medieval history.  I am and as such gained a plethora of knowledge (I have taken her four times).  Her writing assignments are very difficult.  She is not looking for regurgitation of previously covered material, but original analytical thought, as in what historians do.  I highly recommend her.",1
Her Teaching ability is very pathetic,0
"Online course, easy, but assignments were boring and ""worksheet-ish."" Almost no communication. Course VERY poorly designed: missing info and instructions, erroneus assignments/dates; she clearly had not gone through the material and had copy/pasted from a previous semester. Grading return time awful (over 6 weeks). Disaster of an online course.",0
"Dr. Guerriero is such a sweetheart! Although her class is a little dry at times, she definitely knows what she is talking about, and I learned a lot in her class! I would definitely recommend her if you WANT TO TEACH special ed! If you want to teach gen ed, she may be a little boring to you.",1
"Wonderful Class! I never once looked at the book so it isn't necessary but isn't useless as I'm using it in my 2nd semester of Chem. Her lectures are very imformative and for the students that were A grade students in high school, it is very possible to get one if you study! She's the adorable mom type while still being young.",1
I took this class online with Dr. Fitzpatrick and it was fairly easy. Her exams were easy and she has IBP assignments that require some reading but it's not too bad. She is very understanding and cares for her students. Just stick to reading and meeting deadlines and this class will be a breeze.,1
"He's amazing. Very Knowledgeable about science. Very lenient, fair grader. He also cares about our future and the wellbeing of the school. He made me like Baruch. He made me enjoy Biology more than I ever did. His Classes were lovely. A- for Lab and Lecture. He won't negotiate your score if you make an error in the scantron test sheet.",1
Worst teacher I have ever had. I had to drop. Niu is very quiet which makes it really boring. She has no passion. Doesn't know how to teach.,0
"The best professor in the Chem department at RU! He goes above and beyond for his students and will stop at nothing to help you succeed. The hard thing about Chem 2 is that he doesn't make the exams. Kimmel does, (and they are very tricky). Do all Tavvs practice problems and you should be ready to tackle anything!",1
Interesting class. A rational approach to religion. Not all are committed to reason. Be prepared to read and discuss the material.,1
"Professor Conway does nothing but read off his powerpoints every lecture. There are few opportunities for grades in this class so make them count, especially considering he is a very hard grader. He will pick out the smallest detail in an assignment just so you don't get a 100. Don't take the class if you don't have to.",0
Mrs. Dodson has been the best math professor I have ever had. I am not very good at math but this online class was not bad at all. She is understanding of life issues that may get in the way of school work and she will do anything that she can to help her students. Thank you so much Mrs. Dodson!!! You are the best !,1
"Prof. Wood's nice person & knows lots about math; BUT, she expects you to know as much about math as she does. She grades EXTREMELY HEAVILY on tests & quizzes. One skipped step in factoring & your grade will suffer. She'll mark your answer wrong if you use a different method to get the same answer. Good luck on trying to pass this class :/",0
I would totally take Hinton for every Biology course if I could! She was amazing! I loved her! She is so caring and hilarious! She goes off of topic a lot but make sure you show up to the reviews! Make sure you study the reviews because they are JUST like the tests (like word for word). Answer questions and she will give you bonus points :-),1
"Great at getting me to think differently. Though the projects were hard, and most time very open ended, the ideas were pretty interesting and my work got so much better.",1
She's a great teacher! Extremely easy and doesn't place much emphasis on writing. More so on understanding the topic and analyzing it. Lots of group interaction too.,1
"Ning is a horrible teacher. I dont know why he is there. I ended up dropping his class, if you dont understand math very well, do not take him. Huge language barrier, and you have to basically teach yourself.",0
"Great guy, but rambles a lot. The course is centered around writing a research paper at the end of the semester. Throughout the process, he is often unclear on what exactly he expects from students as far as assignments go. Overall, not a bad teacher to have for this GE class.",1
"He give a lot of homework, but it is so easy. His class saved my gpa. He  is such a great teacher.",1
"If you want to fail a course, go ahead and take a class with this instructor. He's unorganized, and his teaching motto is ""I write on board and you figure out"", um okay? Then why have an instructor? English isn't his 1st language so there's a MAJOR language barrier, if he doesn't understand your question he completely ignores you.",0
Does not even try even a little bit too make her class engaging. Not to mention that the lecture and textbook readings are literally word for word. Her tests were tricky and with limited time it was really easy to mess up. Felt that she didn't want to teach or want her students to do well.,0
"Where do I begin. How about the fact that we finished the curriculum BEFORE SPRING BREAK. We hadn't had exam 1 and he was already teaching exam 3 material. I use the term ""teachcing"" VERY loosely. He does not work out problems contrary to what he says. He puts a piece of paper on a project and reads the numbers for 15 seconds. A V O I D. ",0
"Highly recommend for STAT 305. Weekly homework that isn't too bad. Gives out example quizzes that are very similar to the actual quiz. I really enjoy his voice during lecture, very clear and he always seems like he's in a good mood.",1
"Took Prof. Osoba two semesters back-to-back and not only did he remember past students, but he would also genuinely take the time to ask how you've been, what you've been up to, and will reference past class information. He's quite old-fashioned and is a very paper and pencil type of guy, but he's a fair grader, and the syllabus is easy to follow.",1
One of the better teachers I have had yet. She goes over problems in great detail and will personally help you if you go to her. She wants to see everyone understand why things happen and not just getting the answer.,1
really seems like an easy class but the only way you can get a A is by literally getting above a 90 on all exams.. not really easy. Even with getting all 90's you will most likely get a B+ .,1
"I would totally take another class with Scott.  He's excellent, and I really like how he gives you free reign to do the assignments.  Make sure you at least skim the books for the quizzes; he gives at least one a week.",1
"I thought it was an easy class, if you did well in 2nd year research methods its almost a review. No exams, all assignments. If you go to class he gives you good directions for them, is enthusiastic and willing to help.",1
One of my all time favorite teachers!!! He grades really hard but extra credit and all the help you want makes his classes worthwhile to take.,1
"There is so much reading. The worst part is for the test, she gave us 54 terms for us to define and only 10/12 will be on the actual test and out of those 10/12, we only have to do 5/6. Lectures are alright but they do not redeem for how much reading there is or how she handles the test study guide.",0
"She is a nice person,but is not recommended. She had you answer a question out of your GuidedNotebook everyday.So you had to be there to get the points,put tons of HW online. i slept through  the class nearly every day and would have skipped if i could have and still got like a 99% in there.The test are easy did not study for 1 and aced em all!!!!!",0
"Dr. Chalk is an AMAZING professor, one of the best. She is so caring about her students, she truly makes an effort to get to know each one. Her class is engaging and she makes literature interesting even if you find it difficult. Dr. Chalk is a very fair grader and gives great feedback on essays and assignments. The grading criteria is super clear.",1
"It seemed like there was always an assignment due practically every day of the week. Did not understand the grading criteria. Also, I feel as though she took important matters not seriously, such as cheating. Also I basically only wrote about one continuous topic throughout the entire semester.",1
"Among the best profs of my undergrad years.  Material is presented very clearly.  Professional and respectful of all viewpoints.  A LOT of reading. Class is fast-paced, relevant, interesting.  Accommodating and VERY knowledgeable.",1
Ree is a wonderful teacher. I changed my major after taking his class. ,1
Not as bad as the other reviews say. If you pay attention to the lectures and do the homework the class should be easy. She is helpful and generally knows what she is talking about. Make sure you do not cheat because she will ask you about your code and if you can't answer her questions she will knock points off.,1
"He was my reason to get up for my 8:30 classes. My only regret is not going to enough of his office hours :( Great prof, attended every lab and helped everyone, even if they didn't need help. Hopefully I have him again soon!!",1
"Ok. He gives good lectures, the movies are super boring and the tests.. yeah.  they're WAY TOO HARD. he asks the most obscure questions that no one would ever know or remember. you never ever get out early and he'll give you a 2 minute break. he'll be like, the tests were pretty good... and everyone got d's, c's, and f's.",1
He's a great professor and is very knowledgable on what he teaches. ,1
"Very lenient grader, I had to email him a few times after submitting assignments late and he always accepted them. His accent is sometimes next to impossible to understand, though. I wouldn't recommend taking him unless you're confident that you can figure out the class on your own.",1
"Vraimenr ennuyant comme cours. Le livre suffit pour la matière. Les examens ne traitent même pas de la matière vu en classe, c'est seulement de la logique. Ce n'est aucunement du par coeur, mais du bon sens. Elle est très généreuse dans la correction des travaux et le cours est facile a passé. Personne coule.",0
"Great Professor. Every class you will receive stacks of papers (some important, most for reference). I would definitely take him again.",1
"Graham is a really nice guy and you can tell he actually wants to be there. The class mainly consisted of quizzes, 4 big exams, and the Final. The quizzes, however, were more like in class assignments, because you can work together and even ask him for help. If you miss a quiz day, you receive a 0, but he dropped the 2 lowest quiz scores.",1
One of the BEST professors at ELAC!!! If you aren't too well at Math I suggest to take her. Very understandable and patient. Test are really similar to the review. The homework is a lot but it helps with remembering the material. Her lectures are the best and the notes are really easy and understandable.,1
"This was by far the easiest class I have ever taken in my entire life.  He is really easy, too easy. I got an A for his class yet I feel like I wasted my time learning nothing.",1
"Amazingly subjective grading, recognize that picking your battles in the beginning may very well save your grade in the end. I.E. don't argue about your first grade, argue about midterm and final. Start on projects immediately, they are very difficult for the time constrains provided.",0
"If you are looking for an easy language class stay away from ASL. Instructor is passionate, and works with the deaf community.Practice, practice and practice. You have to make time for this class because there are events to be completed and test to study for. This class was a lot of hard work but I enjoyed it and learned a lot.",1
"By far the best math professor I've ever had. Her lectures are very clear and she explains things in a way everyone can understand. She is caring and wants her students to succeed and really understand the material. She is available for help out of class, provides test reviews beforehand, tests are straighforward. Absolutely recommend her to anyone",1
"Take it with some one else. He is a nice guy, but over-complicates topics that should be easy to understand. Awful at explaining the material. If you don't have an innate knack for stats, this class will make your situation even worse.",0
"Dr. Hill does a great job at lecturing for the number of students in the class. She is interactive and tries to make what we learn relatable. The tests are not too bad as most questions come from the quizzes, clicker questions, and end of chapter ""self-check"". Overall, as long as you go to class and put in some effort, you will get an A.",1
Very nice teacher and always answered any questions you had.,1
Weaver is a very intelligent passionate professor. Long lectures due to all the information he wants you to know and sometimes repetitive. Many assigned readings but they are usually short. He has you get into groups and complete 4 projects throughout the semester. Take home midterm and final and is a reasonable grader. ,1
"Overall, I enjoyed taking this class. Professor Gonzalez definitely wants to make sure that you do well in his class, especially when it comes to essays. He gives good feedback. He doesn't assign that much HW. My only complaint is that the textbook was barely ever used, which means that I bought it for nothing.",1
"This course was set up well during the pandemic, with a module due every 2 weeks. The modules contained 1-2 quizzes and a discussion plus the occasional case study. Just make sure you completed everything in the module and know your due dates as they dont show up on your BB calendar. Great class with lots of flexibility.",1
She's not that bad but she is not the best professor. She was sick for a week and made us write a paper for attendance credit. She also had to remove 9 questions for our last exam taking away 18 points from us and just put one extra credit question to make up for it. She does not give any extra credit and wont budge on it.,0
"Worst teacher ever. Studying in KPU from 2 years, never dealt with this kind of stupid teacher. Never take any course with this guy. Doesnt know ""C""m of coding just copying code from internet and showing videos. If the teacher is reading, I want to ask how data structure is related to AVENGERS movie budget.",0
"Awesome teacher! Extremely helpful and available, but you have to go to class and do all the work. Tests are not hard and a major project easy and fun to do. I definitely recommend her!!",1
This Professor is absolutely amazing! The textbook he picked for the class is a good read!,1
One of the most amazing teachers I have ever had in my college career!! I would come back to NGU just to take another class with her!,1
"This is my second class with this professor. There are a few quizes and 3 exams. He also offers an optional bank case that replaces your lowest exam grade. If you need to contact him, do so through his FIU email. He definitely helped me out when i missed an exam because i was in the ER. He reopened the exam the next day.  Exams are a little tricky.",1
Dont take her. She doesnt give a crap about her students. I WENT THROUGH SO MUCH and SHE GAVE ME A D. Dont take her if something drastic is happening in your life and all you want to do is stay in school. Just dont. Believe me... she doesnt care.,0
Chemistry isn't my strong suit but she made it pretty clear in lecture. Definitely have to study a couple days before the exams because she makes you memorize everything but half the periodic table and equations. Still a good professor to have for such a difficult course,1
"First of all, Pannell seems like a great guy and will respond to you if you have any questions. The way he lectures is a little tough to follow. He will kind of bounce around and fly through powerpoints. He does give decent study practice tests for the tests. Overall not a bad guy, his teaching style just wasn't for me.",0
"Ms. Avila was a decent professor. The class is slower paced, but she goes over everything, so everything good. She stuck to the powerpoint a little too much, though. As long as you participate and do the practice problems, her class is a fool-proof pass. Good for those who are not a Chemistry major and just need to pass the course",1
"I took a two semester course with Stephanie. While the course was difficult, she did her best to make sure everyone understood. If you are confused, raise your hand! The tests are lengthy, requiring the entire class length. STUDY HARD!! I received an A both semesters, so it is possible. Overall I like her.",1
SHES GOOD. make it to everyclass tho.,1
I do not agree with most of the other ratings. She is passionate about English and explains her papers in details (usually spends almost a whole class just telling you about the paper). Somewhat of a hard grader. Follow what must be included in the paper and you'll be fine. Not the most entertaining class but not too difficult,1
"Love her class! I took to fill a requirement; very clear, informative, and concise about the course plot. She has a love for what she teaches and is a fun lecturer.  Buy her books because if you complete her Study Guides using her book, you will very easily get an A with minimal effort in this class.",1
"Prof Chi is great at what she does. I worked very hard in this class (IBUS1191) because it's a requirement for my major. Beware of CITATION , she will take points for it. Overall I enjoyed her class.",1
"Dr. Carter has been through a lot this semester and he still came to all our classes with a smile and was always prepared to discuss the readings even when people didn't read, and he always showed understanding for what students are going through. He is such a committed teacher and kind person. The class ha a lot of reading but the papers are easy.",1
"Professor Weis makes coming to class worth it. She knows how to keep your interest during a lecture with jokes and personally stories. Professor Weis makes her class very comfortable. She rather you participate a lot in class so that you won't have work to do out of class. She assigned a few journal entries, two papers, and one group project.",1
Fannie is a fairly new lecturer but she was very good. She was speaking clearly and adjusting quickly to the students' needs. She was receptive and helpful.,1
Will is a great professor. He made programming really easy to understand and is lightyears better than most of the other IT professors. Definitely recommend his classes.,1
"I like the way he teaches but he is pretty hard and semi-strict, however I learned a lot and I would take him again",1
"Seemed nice but this class is for the few that can teach themselves an entire 600 pages of material without any help or direction. Mostly he seemed uncommitted to the class, not giving us study guides (just old tests that might be relevant to what we were studying) wouldn't post grades, and took weeks to hand back short papers. Just a bad class.",0
Angie is the best professor I have had so far. Her classes are the ones I look forward to throughout my day. She is motivating and inspirational. She is very passionate about what she does. Overall the best prof I have ever had!!,1
Do not take a class with this professor!!!!! She is unorganized and unfair. Her tests are mostly written answer and what you put down is sure to be wrong. If you ask a question or see her after class she will talk in circles never giving you any clarity. Avoid this women you will struggle!!!!,0
"Really nice, well-meaning professor, but his English is terrible which makes it really hard.  Unfortunately, he's the only professor that teaches first year college physics.  On the plus side, it's a fairly easy class so getting an A shouldn't be tough.",0
"Honestly one of the most lovable and passionate professors I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. You can really tell she loves what she does, she's really laid back and friendly but expects you to put your best effort into the assignments she gives out. I HIGHLY recommend her to everyone (:",1
One of the best teachers I have ever had. She is very nice and understanding. Do the work and you will have no problem in this class.,1
"Wilson gets a bad rep for being vague and very confusing, which is definitely true. Her class was definitely interesting and in my opinion valuable. To be successful in this class just participate in class, do all of the assigned work, go to her office hours (she's really nice), and work well with your group. Tests are super easy.",0
"A genuinely nicer guy, willing to help anyone so long as you send him an e-mail. I have taken a few of his classes and come out with A's and B's. His teaching method makes complex ideas seem elementary. If you have to choose, choose Whigham.",1
"Professor Zank is a wonderful professor and human being. He is a great lecturer, and provides great feedback on paper. However, he does want students to succeed and provides ample opportunities for extra credit if needed. I would take his class again, and take more classes with him. ",1
Jennifer is rude to her students for no apparent reason. It makes learning very difficult.,0
Dr. Erickson is awesome! Bio 3260 is very hard but Dr. Erickson only wants you to succeed. He gives 3 tests and a final but also includes clicker qs and in class worksheets. Very approachable and relaxed and will explain things to your level. Do NOT skip class! Go to his office hours and put in the effort of studying and you will do great.,1
"Really easy to talk to, and super nice guy. And, he's had a solid background teaching mathematics in China(?) and also some part in Europe(?) Also very passionate about his field as demonstrated in the interesting, and funny stories he ties into the lectures related to math.",1
"Professor Ortega is such a kind and amazing professor. Always has office hours and will do his best to help. Ignore all those negative reviews! You dont need to memorize so many slides, just go to class and study a bit. His accent is also not a problem as almost everyone can perfectly understand him. Will even give bonus points for all and cares.",1
"Great teacher, very knowledgeable",1
"You're gonna teach yourself by reading the textbook. If that's how you learn, you will do fine. If you like to see examples of the material being covered, look elsewhere. The grading was fairly soft but inconsistent. I got answers that I knew were right marked wrong and 100% on quizzes that I just guessed. Was quick to respond to discussion boards.",1
"This is one of the worst classes I have taken at the U. Berger gave a quiz during dead week. Made countless mistakes when teaching the material and class was not very helpful. The first three weeks of class were pointless, learning about the history of computers that and never being quizzed or tested on this material.",0
I can honestly say he is a wonderful professor. Me being an essential worker and taking this class during the summer Mr. Weiner was available for any question that I needed answered and I am thankful for his help and guidance.,1
"Professor Calkins is an incredible teacher and she really cares about her students progress, but it can be overwhelming if you aren't prepared to ask for help. I went to office hours when I was struggling and she went out of her way to help. She assigns a lot of reading, but grades very fairly.",1
This class is easy if you do all of the work assigned (which is NOT a lot). She puts grades in very quickly and posts all of the powerpoints before an exam. ,1
"Looking back at the past 5 years of college, Thana was one of the best instructors I had. He made CS very accessible while also challenging me to progress. I also took him for CIS 36B and CIS 27 and I wish I could have taken him for more class still.",1
She is a nice teacher and well prepared but she does not go over the homework in class. ALOT of notes that weren't very helpful. I failed the class.,1
He's a great teacher! when he teaches he always uses a lot of examples to help us understand better and he is very funny. He has quizzes that are easy if you listen in class and take your notes. I would definitely take him again. Easy A,1
"Nice man, very patient with students. Although class is not mandatory, it is important that you go to lectures because they're only twice a week. Quizzes are 1 day before the test. A lot of hw.  Grades on completeness. Tests are hard, but should be easy if you attend all lectures. Willing to work around your schedule.",1
Her tardiness policy is wack. She shows up to class 3-5 minutes early and expects every student to be there or do not show up at all. Multiple times students have been counted as late (then she marks off your final grade every time your late) even before class is suppose to start. She also marks you down if your cell phone is out on your desk.,0
Professor Conta is the best. He goes out his way to make sure that all his students are able to succeed. Disregard the last post. He definitely did not have an AA. He was more than qualified to work for LACC.,1
"Very hard course with him, a lot of the class is failing. Tests are hard (avg grade = 35!. C = 50). OK at teaching (2 out of 5).",0
"Took him last year for 1910 and now just finished taking 1920 with him. I want to stress that Buck is a really nice guy; however, he is not someone you should take if you are majoring in math. His class is pretty easy to get an A in because his study guides are extremely similar but he lacks a good touch in making info understandable. Easy A though",1
"He's a really easy-going prof. Doesn't lecture much. Pretty easy grader. Some of the reading can be boring or hard to get through but he gives you enough time to get it done. 2 group projects, 1 final paper, weekly writing journal graded on word count",1
"Dr. Crowley was specific in how to succeed in the class and on the final. She provided a workbook to be used instead of the textbook, which she created. This was extremely helpful to learning the material and obtaining a good grade on exams. ",1
"Very nice, fairly laid back, but gives an interesting variety of assignments. A bit of a dork, but in a good way",1
"Dr. Feige is more of a comedian than a professor. He spends majority of the lecture cracking jokes and ranting about non-class related subjects and there's tons of work. You pretty much have to teach yourself. A plus to taking this course, he has a few labs a week so if you cant make your scheduled class he will allow you to sit in on another lab.",0
"Dr. Cleveland is very passionate about marketing and it shows in his lectures. Yes, his course is very demanding. His expectations from the group projects are high considering that he does not provide much information. Furthermore, his midterm and exam are very much from the textbook and lectures. The textbook is a life-saver!",1
"He's knowledgeable, but he's a rookie. Not an good speaker in lectures. His in class solutions are riddled with mistakes and hard to pay attention to as a result. HOWEVER, his typed out solutions provided in his tutorials are stellar (they make up for his poor lecture composure). Hard midterm (time wise), but he learned and fixed this for our final",1
Incredible teacher. Really there for students !! Recommend  her 100%  for any Accounting class.,1
"Avoid this teacher, he's awful.",0
I loved Prof. Nuneville!! She was so nice and made lectures interesting. She's high up in the Arlington County PD which is so cool to hear about her career. She also brought in so many guest lecturers because she has so many connections which spiced the class up a bit. I highly recommend taking her!!,1
"Dr. Schnittjer is a super smart guy and has a funny dry sense of humor, but he gives lots of homework.",1
"Professor Israel did great at teaching online. Make sure you watch all of the lectures and take lots of notes on them. Homework is KEY in doing well in this class. If you try on the homework, you will get a good grade easily. First midterm was easy, and the second midterm/final was fine. Ask questions during/after lecture if you are confused.",1
No Comments,0
"Reading the comments on this site is clear that the students were not meeting the minimal requirements listed in the syllabus. Besides, with communication this teacher will bend over backwards for her students if there is an issue and students regularly get mentored after class. Come ready to learn and you will succeed outside of class! Thoughtful!",1
"I wasn't sure about taking an online class, I never have before.  And I was also pretty nervous about taking a philosophy class, it seemed pretty hard to me.  But Matt made it SO interesting!  I looked forward to his lectures every week and have expanded my mind so much.  And as long as you keep up with the work, easy A. Best teacher at Oakton.",1
The meanest professor I have ever encountered at UW. Never put her feet into students' shoes!!! Switched out of her section after she mocked at me because I got one clicker question wrong!!!,0
"Carol is very sassy (in a good way) and is serious about history. DO THE READING! Class discussions are based on the readings that are the only form of homework, and the discussions are extremely helpful for essays and midterms. Once you submit a paper and you don't like the grade, you can submit another draft and she will regrade.",1
"Dr. Holgado is an amazing professor. She genuinely cares for her students and wants them to succeed. This isn't an easy class, but it's definitely possible to get an A. Read the chapter, take notes in class, and study objectives and you should do well on tests. The class takes some work but you'll learn a lot. I highly recommend Dr. Holgado!",1
"Pretty cool guy. Hard to understand at times, but he knows his material. Tests are fairly straight forward and is open book as well as open notes. Homework is only worth 10% so your three tests and final are basically your grade.",1
"One of the best teachers I've ever had. Amazing feedback, hysterical lecturer, clear instruction and expectations. Three meaty papers and you walk out with a solid portfolio. 10/10",1
"I took him 3 times throughout my college career and he was also an advisor for a bit that I went to. Very helpful, caring, and a person to be looked up to. Doesn't grade on a curve, but does give extra credit opportunities. Lab work with him is fulfilling and he is great to work with, and will give you the criticism needed to ensure success",1
"Has a very high opinion of himself, likes to read out his own stories and talks about his life A LOT. There's never a clear definition of what he wants as a paper, and he's a tough grader. I was bored all the time.",0
She made me HATE literature.,0
"I agree with all the postings here.  On a related front, my room mate is a history major and the majors are NOT permitted to take her (I guess this is something of an unwritten rule).  Translation: she is not solid enough for majors, so the general population has to tolerate her.  Do NOT take her if you care about your education.",0
He does not teach well,0
I really enjoyed Darwin and this class.  He has a dry sense of humor and always slips it into every lecture.  His exams really aren't that hard as long as you review all of the material the night before; they're definitely not set up to trick you.  I would definitely take Darwin again if I had the chance!,1
"Not going to lie, this class had a lot of busy work. There are usually about 4 things due every single week, but I really enjoyed her class! Dr. Mark really loves HRD and it shows. I learned so much in her class, and she gives you really good feedback on each assignment.",1
Love this prof! Solid choice if you want you want to learn. Always go to office hours if you are confused because he explains step by step processes and doesn't make you memorize random things. He's really funny too and doesn't make class boring. 2 midterms and lots of homework. and a final. Easy A if you work hard,1
"This professor is very condescending. Random pop quizzes, so beware! He speeds through lectures and doesn't really teach, so prepare to learn the material on your own. I do not recommend his lecture or his lab.",0
"This professor is interesting, sweet and best of all such a hottie. No excessive writing assignments either. He is very handsome A+",1
"I had Mr Hall for two different classes online for my Masters program. I  liked him. He did give tests but all of my grad classes did however his were not timed and only had about seven questions that required about a paragraph response. In comparison to my other classes his was the easiest with the least work, plus he was nice",1
"Class was so confusing that I forgot who I was, where I was, and what I was doing -- it's a great stress reliever.",0
Lectures are very confusing and work can be hard to follow. I'd recommend taking Differential Equations with someone else.,0
"Definitely recommend Dudrick if you're at all interested in Philosophy. You will need the text, but not everybody does the readings every night because he teaches everything in class. Class notes are very important so make sure to get them from a classmate if you miss class.",1
Excellent professor!,1
David is a great teacher! He brings in business professionals to speak to the class in order to offer real world examples. I wish he taught more courses!,1
Terrible and deleted my last rating.,0
"Professor Esposito is PHENOMENAL!!! He is extremely passionate about what he teaches, and I adore his ""pathos"" during lectures. Everyone who gave him a low rating probably didn't put in the effort to do well in the class. He is the best and I would take him again 100 times if I could. Loved this class!",1
She sometimes didn't respond to my emails and didn't give us enough information. Pushed the 3rd test and final so close together at the end of the semester. Spend most of your time trying to pass the frustrating mathxl questions,0
Take him. Whatever chance you get. TAKE EVERY CLASS OFFERED WITH HIM.,1
"Tough class, but he will give you points for anything, so show your work. Great guy and awesome class. If you think the material is boring, it will make it hard to listen and do well.",1
"His slides are pretty heavy, lots of information on them will be needed for your final project! He has pop quizzes at least once a week and takes attendance that will have an affect on your final grade. His grading rubric is very complicated to understand, make sure to go over it multiple times before starting your papers. Also strict on grammar.",1
"He is an awesome teacher. As long as you do the assignments, you will pass the class. He responded to any questions I had, and graded everything in a timely matter. His class was very interesting, and I enjoyed taking it. Overall, I recommend him for any online class that he teaches.",1
"He is absolutely amazing. Although I have not passed the class with the grade that I wanted, the material learned in Matt's class has taught me a great amount of knowledge to move forward with my psychology studies. This is the second time that I have taken a lab with him and I am very glad that I was able to spend another semester with him!",1
"Dr. Ghosh cares for her students and is organized. As long as you do the assignments on time, you will do well in the course. There is one online test which is proctored and there is one project. She gives great feedback and usually gets the grades back in a short amount of time. You do have to be pretty comfortable with computers & put in the time",1
"Show up and do your homework and you'll pass. Daily in class assignments are part of the grade. In class assig. & reviews applied to tests/quizzes. He puts in the extra time to answer all questions and give 1 on 1 time as needed. Showed work for in class practice problems, give clear step by step instructions, and set us up to be successful.",1
"Amazing professor, will certainly grow your interest of the music industry.  His lectures were incredibly informative and you will feel very fortunate to be in his class because he has so much knowledge to offer and you will absorb more of it than you could ever imagine, if you put in the work. It's a hard class, but well worth it.",1
"I took Biological anthropology taught by Dr. Cox . The material she presented was interesting and went beyond the textbook. There were not any complaints that I could find for her class. Well structured, clearly graded and multiple opportunities for extra credit if you missed an assignment. Great lectures, Dr. Cox is enthusiastic about teaching!",1
"SO many errors on her tests. EVERY test we had there were at least two questions she had to go and ""consult"" with another instructor about. She is CONSTANTLY talking about irrelevant information (her son and her ""granddog""). Over half of lecture was spent talking about her family. You don't learn in her class!",0
"I really enjoyed this class! There is a lot of reading, but class discussions were really great. I did not participate much, but I wish I did more. I really recommend Stevens and this class!",1
Professor Smith is an exceptional instructor. I really enjoyed his class completing the communication assignments.,1
"I don't recommend taking this professor. Doesn't grade fairly (makes mistakes in grading and gets mad when we ask for points back), very defensive, condescending to students, no one wants to ask questions because she always answers rudely. We leave feeling discouraged. We had a full class and everyone dropped out except maybe 8 of us. Lucky them.",0
Dr. Fredrickson is an extremely kind and helpful professor. He has a genuine interest in the success of his students and makes every effort to accommodate student's needs. Would definitely recommend!,1
Ethan is a great professor! ENES 100 is designed to be a very challenging course for students early in their engineering journey. Don't be too disappointed if you don't actually understand what is happening. Be sure to go to office hours. He's super accessible outside of class. He truly wants every one of his students to succeed. You'll learn a lot,1
"I've met only a few professors that care about their students as much as Dr. Ross does. He's incredibly down to earth and puts himself in your shoes if you're struggling. He overall really wants you to succeed and get a lot out of the material. Along with that, he provides extra credit, along with reviews for every exam. Take him if you can.",1
great teacher. she only plays favorites because only some kids talk and other decide not to so she obviously gets to know the kids who talk more.  there is work to do but she makes it very interesting. i am not the kind of student who goes to class because i like it and i am intrested however this class i liked and was interested in.,1
As an anthropology major I was waiting for this class and it did not disappoint. There is a lot of theory but I felt like Carter made it intersting and easy to grasp. One exam and a final project. Only criticism is that graduate students can take the course and sometimes show disrespect in class. I wish Carter would have been more confrontational,1
"Mrs. Bowlin doesn't do much lecturing at all and her tests can be sort of confusing, but all in all it's a pretty good class and she is really cool.",1
He is definitely quirky and I found him to be quite funny. As long as you study his lectures and the definitions from the book you should have no problem. I think he's a good professor. ,1
"Excellent professor, knowledgeable about the subject, but there is just too much of work, but he makes up by giving tons extra-credit. Try enjoying concerts as 3 concerts are mandatory. A term paper on any composer in MLA format could be a torture, but just talk to him and he'll extend the deadlines. Awesome professor and a easy A class.",1
"Awesome professor. VERY APPROACHABLE. Her lectures are interesting and fun. Online classes can be boring, but she makes it fun by giving nice videos, good examples, and very interesting articles. I learned a lot in all the classes I've taken with her. A lot of tests, yeah, but they are often easy if you read the book and the modules.",1
Professor is very organized and knowledgeable. He is easy to understand and exams are easy. He gives practice exam that are helpful and 80% of those question are in the exam. There is no reason why you would fail his class unless you really didn't put effort on it. ,1
Best English teacher Ive ever had! She is so sweet and will make your English experience soooo much better!!! 100/10 would recommend her. As long as you participate and put in a little effort your going to get a good grade! The discussions in her class make it very interesting and mind opening!,1
"Prof Swift teaches a lot of class in both Cal-Poly Pomona and Claremont 5Cs. As a student in the 5Cs, it is disappointing that the math departments here don't assign him a TA, so we usually don't get feedback on our assignments. But generally, he is good. I like his lectures.",1
"Professor Luckett is not a difficult instructor but you do have to read & complete all assignments to pass his class. He is very knowledgeable in the Social Work field. He expects the same dedication from his students. Discussions, quizzes, and an interview assignment was the semester. He was accessible and always prompt in replying to emails.",1
Take her class!!! Easiest thing you will do. The whole semester we only had class like 10 times. You really have to try to fail her class.,0
Very nice and helpful. Talks too much about her sexual preference. It is mentioned in nearly every class. Very little prep for assignments in class. Talks only to the students who understand what she is talking about. Exams are difficult.,1
"He doesn't give any time in class for lab, even though there states that there is a time designated for lab. He just breezes through the lecture and expects you to be good with the coding. Doesn't teach coding at all, and expects you to do the labs on your own. There are 4 labs, and one final exam and no homework.",0
Taking this course online was rough. Prof Ferguson seems like a lovely woman but definitely struggled to teach this course online. She gave vague directions and nothing she said during her lectures ever made much sense. Would not recommend this course (online at least maybe she is better in person).,0
"He's so critical when it comes to marking. I got an A+ on my last marketing class, but now in his class I barely passed (this was everyone's problem with him). I will never take his class again. On the other hand, he's a good professor. He teaches really well.",0
"This teacher is difficult to work with. I am an honor student and the things that he assigns are completely different than what he expects on the due date. He is rude, and refuses to take into account your opinion, or justification. DO NOT TAKE CLASSES WITH THIS PROFESSOR!",0
"Took her MATLAB course. It had a good balance of quizzes and homework, with the final project being the most daunting part of the whole class (but turned out not being as scary as I thought). Reading the textbook helps when you get confused. She's very willing to help and explains things well, and is available outside of class. Overall, good!",1
Tests are done the following class based on readings that are assigned. The readings vary in length but the test are easy in my opinion. Group discussions can be fun if he does that.,1
"Anatomy is all memorization, if you don't put in the time you wont succeed. She is an easy grader, exams were curved,  nice lady. I wouldn't take anatomy lab with any other professor.",1
Grades hard for no reason. Its an easy class you just get no chance to ask questions because she acts like your dumb if you do.,0
"A lot of memorization but overall super easy.  He is a great teacher and knows what he is teaching.  He keeps the class interesting and has super dry humor that if you catch on to, will laugh a lot.  I highly recommend the class.",1
"I have only been in his class for a couple of days, but what made me automatically not like him is that he said he will not record his lectures. I find this very inconsiderate, especially considering the time we are living in. If you won't make your classes accessible, especially when everyone around us is dying, then you are not a good person.",0
If you study you will learn a lot in this course. Professor drops the exam with the lowest grade. Many exam questions come from multiple choice class quizzes. Eight extra points added to each exam. Professor cares and is enthusiastic. Easy A if you come to class and study.,1
perfect,1
This man is a walking encyclopedia of his subject..The only lecturer here who uses no notes or slides..He has simply inspired me!!!!!,1
"Do the homework, come to class and you will be just fine. This is the first professor who actually helped me understand stats.",1
"Only covers the surface level of topics while lecturing so youre going to be doing a lot of learning on your own. Also grades the study guide as a test, but doesnt grade it until after the test which defeats the purpose of the study guide.",0
"Very interesting class. Dr. Clementz is funny and always willing to go back over unclear material. Tests are very tricky though and require a lot of studying and reading from the book. If you're willing to put in the work, it's worth it.",1
DON'T TAKE HIS CLASS OF COMS3001!,0
"Quinlan is fantastic. He makes long lectures go by very fast with the passion he has for the subject and the fun stories and activities he includes. Usually lets class out early, so don't fret about the four hour class time. Great professor. Tests are VERY difficult, so take notes and study, but he curves extremely generously. No need for textbook.",1
"Although this professor provided detailed feedback (only if you asked for it), it was still hard to achieve what he was asking for. His syllabus, grading rubrics, and feedback is helpful but he is a tough grader and it seemed rare that your work was up to his writing standards. Also, late work is not accepted and will be a 0 so do not rely on it!",1
"I had a rough experience in 101 and 105 during my freshman year, so I wasn't looking forward to taking this class.  It turns out that this class was my favorite this semester!  Mr. Martin, is knowledgeable and cares about his students.  His classes are fun, and he is a great guy.  I recommend him to everyone!",1
"This professor does make jokes but he teaches more then anything, If a student is really listening they will hear that he is teaching unless they are sleeping in the back of the room, took him for this class and I learned what no other teacher at Molly could teach me: to work hard and value me as a person. He helps the students and guides them too.",1
"Prof. Rodriguez is excellent. I am currently taking his class online and I couldn't be happier with the way that he structured it. 3 Exams, quizzes, and a big final research paper. The class is not the easiest (its Finance..) but it is very possible to get an A+. The final project is extremely helpful for your career and it's doable. RECOMMENDED!!!",1
He is great teacher but you'll struggle a lot if you haven't taken a piano class highly recommend to take a piano class before this one. Also make a lot of appointments with him if you don't understand something like the values of the notes. Even if its one thing. This class was hard for me since I was in a guitar class before not piano.,1
"She's really nice and helpful but definitely a tough grader. If you do your best, you'll probably be just fine. ",1
This teacher is incredible. Even after we had to go online she has quickly responded to all my questions. She gave us tons of help preparing for an exam and she even gave us the instructions early and gave us extra time to take the test. Take her! Shes amazing!,1
"if you came to be entertained by the professor, forget it, in this class we are the entertainers. i have new skills and this guy helped me focus on the subject, not the audience which i have always been afraid of",1
"Professor Hanratty is very clear about her expectations on assignments and communicates ideas effectively. She is available for questions and assistance when asked and may not be known to be an ""easy grader"" but is fair in her grading and communicates what you could improve. For this reason, I took both English 121 and 122 from her.",1
"Loved this teacher. Very helpful, very thoughtful, and all around wonderful teacher. Highly recommend Mrs. Van Horn's class. Great Teacher!!",1
I took her class back in 2003. All I can say is watch out for that PURPLE PEN!,1
"While this class was beneficial in polishing my writing techniques, it could have been executed better.  Dr. Nelson was clear in providing his guidelines, but expects excellence.  This ""excellence"" is quite a stretch.  He does grade on improvement, so that is beneficial, but you don't know where you stand until the end of the semester.",1
I loved going to class with Dr. Cutler even though I hated chemistry. I was honestly sad when it was over because I wouldn't have her as a professor anymore. She was amazing and I tell everyone to take chem from her.,1
"LOVED Mrs. Calkins. She is very sweet and caring, and she does a great job of structuring the course and making it easy for students to do well. She really cares about her students. She is a tough grader, and she expects a lot from her students, but she has detailed assignment descriptions and rubrics so you know exactly what she's looking for.",1
"""Ah, be careful!"" His accent had me terrified the first week. Very difficult to understand anything, in both directions.  He is Chinese(?) and spent many years working in Germany, so from time to time he'll abruptly shout mid sentence, which is hilarious.  He does get easier to understand. He is dope. Easy class, enthusiastic.",1
Very knowledgeable and caring,1
"I was kind of nervous to start this class but Dr. Ferguson is an amazing professor. Shes very caring and always willing to talk to students. She gives you 3 autobiographies to read so as long as you plan out your reading youll be fine. The books do show up on the final. Her exams are pretty easy, plus she brings her dog to class sometimes.",1
She's awesome. Just do yourself a favor and take her class. You won't ever want to miss a class. Trust me.,1
"she is awesome ESL professor. she is caring about student a lot, lectures are amazing, the class is easygoing , help you a lot. I love the class that I had with her.",1
"The amount of reading for this class is inhumane. Do not take this if you have no interest in anthropology or reading. I had to get 11 books just for this class. Can get a B without reading, but some of the material is hard to understand without reading. Lecture slides arent provided, and its presented in a really boring way.",0
"Easily the worst professor I've had at tech. I understand online school this quarter was a drastic change, but oh my. 100 question tests, 60 minutes, and HARD. 10 question quizzes, 5 minutes. Tries far too hard to exert an extreme amount of control, and came off as very untrusting and condescending. Incredibly hard class online this quarter.",0
"Dr. Trombley is great!  Her instructions are clear and there are no surprises.  Her tests are incredibly straight forward and if you do the reading you will do well!  She makes learning fun with her discussion too.  Definitely take her, I would again!",1
"The lectures were SO boring, and class participation was essential - unfortunately, Prof. Cividanes has no idea how to properly foster participation, instead asking questions that were rhetorical or so random that we were at a loss. Expect a lot of work on Latin America (where he's from) He didn't even MENTION foreign aid until week 6.",0
I really enjoyed this class. Victoria Dixon was knowledgeable and willing to help students!,1
"The class itself is interesting, but Sun makes the class a little bit boring. Generally, he's grading is fair to what you have done. Sometimes he likes to give tricky quizzes to let you guys down, also he likes to raise some questions, but he never gives you back the answer, which will make you feel suspended to the answer.",0
I learned a lot about networking in his data communications classes including Internet and higher-layer protocols. Great basis for research.,1
"Interesting Course with progressive finish The first 4 weeks of this 8 weeks class were very hard and revealed itself to be a blessing as i was eager to study this interesting course. I spent many hours studying in the first 4 weeks and after the midterm the amount of studying remained the same , however the amount of papers + lessons lessened. Yes",1
I took this class online for public speaking. I hate making speeches but was able to make it through with it for this class. The amount of work given was normal. She also gives opportunities for extra credit. They are a bit time consuming but worth it! I never had a problem with receiving a response when needed.,1
"This is a great class, although quite demanding.  Nancy was very straight forward about her expectations for the class and I think some people struggled because of the amount of memorization required.",1
"Les examens sont supers faciles, mais elle est chiante sur la correction des travaux. Ses travaux sont d'ailleurs pas clairs. Elle parle très doucement et ne fait que lire des statistiques et ses powerpoints. On apprend pas grand chose, et c'est un cours super ennuyant.",0
"There is homework after every class so expect it. Quizzes are on what you read for homework. 4 essays and 5 journals, but several quizzes - but mainly one test. As long as you keep up and do all the homework the class isn't bad, but slack once and it will be terrible. Overall a good class and she is a very good teacher.",1
"Dr. Hoffman is a positive, quirky, kind individual and genuinely cares about his students and their career path. I recommend recording lectures on your phone, and listening to it when going over slides. Exams are similar to practice questions, BCH369 consist of 5 exams, BCH370 consist of 3 exams and 4 homework assignments. I wish I had him again!",1
"When I first started the class I swore I would give her a bad review, but as the semester progressed she began to grow on me. She can be very firm with students who are not paying attention and put them on the spot, but she has a heart of gold and I ended up enjoying her class. Field trips are fun, you get to go to the beach (:",1
"Such an easy class and such a cool prof! His assessments are very easy and his lectures are a lot of fun. Only downside is he has no clue how to use mycourses. If you miss a lecture there are no slides or anything to learn from, that content is lost to you forever.",1
Must be computer savy. Lots of reading but if you do the work you definitely will pass. Always there to help you get through an assessment if you dont understand. Answers emails in a good amount of time. Must get the book to pass. Definitely would take this teacher again.,1
"This guy is awesome. Patient, clear explanations and presentations, very helpful when you need him, calm personality, and best of all, you learn the material without having to bust your brain. Just study and ask him if you have any issues, and he'll gladly help you. Excellent Professor. I'm glad I took him",1
"Maureen is a very hard marker! This course is a lot of work and participation counts! I suggest not skipping a single class and keeping up with the large amount of readings. If you want to do well, make sure you talk about feminism.. she will talk forever about that topic! Expect over three quarters of the class to drop this course by the end.",0
She is an amazing professor! She makes class fun and is easy going. As long as you do the work you will get an easy A. I totally recommend taking her.,1
He is horrible; one of the worst in NJIT if not the worst.Complete disaster!!,0
Avoid at all costs. For context I am in the honors program and was a straight A student. Ive had hard profs and classes before. But she is a gpa crusher. She doesnt care about any student. Terrible teacher. Wont learn and will be punished for it. Avoid this professor,0
okay teacher i guess,1
"She was a great professor, but her exams were kind of hard. Even while speaking in spanish, she was easy to understand.",1
He's funny as hell and a real class act. Exams are really easy and his lectures are bearable. Go out of your way and get to know the guy if you have him online. He's great,1
No Comments,1
A lot of people do not like this prof because they do not take the time to get to know her. After talking to the prof during office hours I got to see how nice she was and how she cared about her students doing well in her class. Although she has an accent it is easy to understand her if you listen a little more carefully. Great prof overall.,1
"She is an awesome prof! She really wants everyone to learn and cares if you understand the material. She is very patient and understands that the material is a little bit more difficult. Go to class, take notes, and study.",1
"Best professor I've had at SEMO. Although our only grades in the class were 3 exams, if you actually come to class and listen to all the awesome stories he has, it's definitely a fun class and you will learn a lot. By far the most fun and educational class I've had so far. He has lots of outside work experience as a qualified leader and manager.",1
Good professor. I highly recommend taking his class.,1
he is a really good teacher but the only issue is he should be more specific about what he wants from his students in assignments.,1
Excellent professor. Genuinely wants her students to do well and will explain things in a variety of ways in order to ensure that everybody gets it. Her experience outside of academia shows because she emphasizes the topics that are actually used on the job. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!,1
On god this is literally the worse professor I have ever had. When I tell you do not take this class you better listen. She is so picky on her grading and everything she will not give you credit for some small stuff. The grading is not in your favor if you mess up on part its over for you and the semester. If you get caught lackin on GOD it's OVER,0
Plus gros pervers de l'UQAM. Cest une manipulateur pervers jai etait ecoeurer de ce prof qui vient de la campagne. Faut vraiment que LUQAM refasse ses criteres de selection.,0
Hands down the BEST professor at USC. I took Ochem B last fall and he was honestly a god send. Cares about students and is really good at teaching. Ochem B is fundamentally a hard class but he makes the class actually enjoyable. He's really great at office hours and you honestly don't need SI. His practice problems are all you need to do well .,1
"Flannery is a good choice. He explains things well and cares that you understand. This class uses mindtap which comes with an e-book, so you don't have to have a physical copy. Weekly homework assignments, but they're easy but a little time consuming.  He did say he was switching books in the fall, though, so this may change.",1
"He is a Red Sox fan.  He likes to talk about them.  He isn't a bad guy, he uses real life examples and likes to talk about politics too.  The class wasn't that bad.  Hard, but he gave me a decent grade at the end.",1
"Incredibly talented and relatable, a treat to have been in her class. Extremely fun and caring. Sparks insightful conversation and loves her job. Thank you for everything Dr. Ferreira!",1
"If you have the chance to take a class from LaBelle you must! She is so nice and down to earth. There is one midterm and a final but she provides study guides for both, but they are very easy. Lots of chances to boost your grade. She really cares about the students and makes sure to get to know each of us. Cant wait for another class with LaBelle",1
quality teaching approach and makes the student think analytically,1
I took Ancient Western Philosophy with Prof. Shartin. I was extremely excited about the class until I had him. He is never organized and gave the exact same notes every day. Then didn't understand why 75 percent of the class failed his first quiz when none of the questions pertained to the notes he gave. Steer clear if you like organization.,0
Great professor! He is very helpful and clear on the content. There are only 3 tests and 3 papers with no final so its a pretty easy course even though the tests and papers can be somewhat challenging.,1
"I have taken all the classes required for my cis associate before I took this class. So, I took this class at the end with Professor, when I found cis 20 is also required. I feel that I should have taken his class earlier. I finally do have confidence in Computer Programming after taking his class this semester. He is best if you want to learn.",1
"One of the worst professors I've had. Nothing she talks about in class is on the tests so if you don't memorize the text book, you won't do good on the test. All she talks about is sex because apparently she is a ""sex anthropologist"" -which would be funny if she didn't make the class so hard.",0
Best professor I have had. Really cares about the students.,1
"Really good professor, especially since it is his first year teaching this course. Funny and pretty understanding when it comes to grades. Homework once/twice a week online that more than prepares you for the tests. My only qualm with the class was that it was a bit too easy for ""honors"" calculus.",1
"He's super nice and funny, but not the best at teaching. I found his lectures a bit all over the place and confusing. I don't think I would've done well if I hadn't taken macroeconomics first. Couldn't really tell how he graded the group project. Overall, I wouldn't avoid him, but wouldn't go out of my way to take him, either.",1
Clesr grading criteria. Do the readings and weekly quizzes (which are open book and at home) and youll be fine. Midterm and final-- super clear.,1
"Nancy is very knowledgeable - she definitely knows her facts and has had a lot of hands on anthropology experience. The class is pretty easy as long as you take good notes. Skipping class is not an option. If you read what you're supposed to read, take notes,  and put decent effort into the labs you should get an A.  ",1
"Bon prof, très drole, des examens à la portés de tout le monde, je le recommande :) ",1
"I learned so much in this class, be prepared to spend a good 2 hours per day on this class if you want a good grade. I worked full time while taking this class and it was a nightmare. READ THE CHAPTER BEFORE YOU COME TO LECTURE, it won't seem like she's going as fast and her ideas will be much clearer.",1
"1 lecture and 2 discussions a week. Her lectures are mandatory since there's iclicker points. 2 exams and a final (with a retake on 1 exam if you did poorly). 2 essays with an opportunity to edit mistakes for some points back. Lots of useless online homework and workbook activities. She can be helpful, but test out of this class if you can.",0
"I loved Adelle's classes. She has such an interesting past and is very involved in the field of Forensic Psychology. The lectures were interesting and had awesome information provided. I enjoyed showing up for class and looked forward to readings. Grading was fair, the quizzes were easy - studying for midterm and final is essential!",1
"Calculus is a tough subject. It takes effort, but Travis makes it as clear as possible. Since he provides clicker exercises,  attendance is mandatory. He is accessible outside of class and completely cooperative. I would recommend taking Travis for any Calc class.",1
This guy is funny! Good PowerPoint. Make sure you have a good pen to take all the notes. He does not e-mail or post the PowerPoints. This is one of the best teachers that I have ever had and I am gradumated!,1
"Professor. Weaver is one of those professors you'll remember forever. The guy really knows his stuff, and truly found my self engaged during his lectures. Lot's of info in lectures, but really applies it to real life situations. He was always available for questions, even helped me with my internship when I asked questions. Great guy, great prof.",1
Professor Wider is a great professor. He's very easy going and understanding. His tests and quizzes are very easy if you do the readings assigned. Would definitely recommend him!,1
Expect to spend many hours on homework. Type of Professor to choose the hardest questions from the homework to put on the exams so be prepared. A few subjects here and there that are'nt covered in the book which is a bit annoying but overall he's a decent Professor and you will learn A LOT in this class if you put in the work. Lenient grader!,1
His lectures are extremely well organized. His tests come directly from lecture notes (never used the book). He doesn't require any other work for the class. I enjoy this class bc it doesn't take much effort to pass. I highly recommend taking him!,1
I DO NOT recommend this professor.,0
"Professor Wood has been one of my absolute favorite teachers. If you show up, participate, do the homework and study; you will pass. She is an amazing teacher who is caring and respectful. I loved the open forum style in the class and that so much of the class was really helpful in regular day to day life. This class was so much more than expected.",1
"Nice guy.  Great sense of humor.  Took his online course and tests were extremely hard.  People I've talked with say his in class tests are easier. Assignments weren't bad.  Not too bad overall, but you had better know the material backwards and forwards before taking one of his online tests.",1
I took this class as one of my English program requirements and I want to take the rest of my classes with him. We only had two papers for the quarter and a small midterm paper. It is easy to get by doing just the reading for your essay and he is very helpful in giving you feedback before you turn in your paper.,1
"Ben is a great instructor! He's knowledgeable, quirky and grades fair. I would absolutely take another one of his classes. We used My Math Lab exclusively which comes with an electronic copy of the book. I think I accessed the online book twice. I felt like there were no surprises in the class. Due dates were clear and reasonable.",1
Very excellent teacher. Always friendly and very helpful.,1
"This Professor was extremely helpful when contacted about class content.  He replies to every post with constructive input, not a blanket statement to all the students in the class on discussion post. Highly recommend taking his class.",1
Melody put in the effort for our online class. There are weekly quizzes with either a journal or a forum post. She grades everything within a week and also adds feedback. She is positive and makes the class enjoyable. I have never taken an online course I've liked but she changed that.,1
"She's very patient and if she sees that the class doesn't understand what she's talking about, she goes over it in a different way. She's always willing to help in and out of class. She's also a perfectionist so she will point out where you could do better, but she understands that night classes = busy people.",1
The best CBE teacher I've ever had. Do HW and practice exams that he posts and you should be fine.,1
"Very smart and helpful professor. Always available to help out. If you go to class, and actually try plus his help you will most likely pass with an A.",1
Professor Bates makes class material very interesting and engaging with her out going personality. However you must study the material and her notes in order to receive at least B. She is still my favorite professor on campus!,1
Heard from a couple of classmates that she can be kinda rude. Tests are filled with trick questions but you often won't have enough time to catch them. It's only lectures and readings. Not the worst class but not engaging at all.,0
"Brooke is the BEST math professor Ive ever had in my life! I really struggled with previous classes from other teachers, but Mrs. Kennedy made math a breeze. She gives awesome study guides that cover nearly everything on the tests, so I always felt prepared without wondering what the questions might be on. She is also very enthusiastic & caring!",1
"an easy course, if you don't listen to the professor.  I just took all of my notes from the book and answered any questions she had in class, and I ended up getting a really easy A",1
"The take-home quizes were based on the book, but attendance was still graded.  A sign that an instructor doesn't know what they're doing.  I dropped the class because I  got sick of extrapolating conclusions that weren't in the book.   If you're not learning anything, then why are you even here?  Seriously, no joke, don't take a class from her.",0
"Literally the worst teacher I have had at Providence College. Her lectures make no sense whatsoever because she doesn't understand what she is teaching. Her exam questions do not reflect what she has ""taught."" You will receive nothing from lecture and you will have to teach yourself everything. She will kill BIO for you if you take her.",0
"I normally wait until the end of the semester to write these but I just cant wait: this lady is way too picky. Ive gotten into it with her a few times bc of her unfair grading. She overcomplicates everything. Claims to not have gotten my emails, has yet to fix my attendance when I was in the hospital. She does too much. Condescending & boring.",0
Marek is a terrible teacher. He is very hard to understand. His lessons do not make sense as well. I think he just wakes up and teaches on the fly. Ridiculous how Humber College still has him hired.,0
Shes a pretty good professor she will help you a lot!!!!!,1
this class was easy for me I made 90's on all of my papers the class are long and boring but shes not very strict to when it comes to drafts and final drafts she worries more about the final paper ,1
"Her class is a pretty easy A. The textbook that is used is written by her and has study guides in the back that will definitely get you an A on all of the exams. Lectures are interesting, and she is very passionate about the arts. Extra credit opportunities are more than enough and the quizzes are very easy.",1
Knows exactly what he is talking about but his accent is very hard to understand. If you have never taken chemistry before I would not recommend this professor. Read the book and study a lot if you want to pass the class.,1
"I enjoyed the class, hated the instructor. She did nothing the whole semester. She put the assignments on canvas and then I never heard from her again the rest of the semester. If you need a class that is more structured with feedback on assignments, she is not the teacher for you!!!",0
"I took the half semester option for this class. He is an interesting and nice guy, but different when it comes to grading. He is very inconsistent and tends to take away major points if your paper isn't exactly the way he would have written it.",0
"THE BEST PROFESSOR. Seriously loved her so much, I wish she taught more classes in my major. I actually looked forward to going to this class. Also, you have to actually try to not get an A in this class. So easy!!",1
You literally need to attend class if you want to be on her good side and get a good grade,1
"Didn't really like him. I'm minoring in history and am really passionate about it, but it wasn't really engaging at all. lectures were really boring, LOTS of daily HW. gave us a great outline for the midterm though, without it I would've failed. he's a sweet guy, but I wouldn't take it again. many like him though so who knows. kinda dryyyy",0
"she gives a lot of work like assignments, her lecture is good, the exams are the way to difficult and she is difficult to approach",0
she is a fun teacher but grade projects really hard.,1
She is a wonderful and caring professor. She really wants you to succeed but at the same time your going to have to earn it. She understands life events and is willing to work with you to reschedule tests. She will really explain things to you and tries to determine your skill level and make it understandable.,1
"MR. CONTA'S AN AWESOME PROFESSOR. HE KNOW WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE HE WAS WITH THE LAPD FOR 32 YEARS BEFORE HE RETIRED  ABOUT 5 YEARS AGO. HE'S A GREAT ROLE MODEL AS WELL. I REALLY ADMIRE THE FACT THAT HE'S SO POSITIVE AND NICE TO EVERYONE AFTER BEING A COP FOR SO LONG, MOST TRY TO EITHER ACT HARD OR HAVE A TENDENCY TO VIEW THE WORLD IN A PE",1
"He's an extremely helpful professor however, you do need to do all the homework when I did all of the homework I got a B on his exam. Do the homework and pay attention he will have the same problems with a slight change. If you do the homework you are set for his exams and attend class & take notes. They are part of his exams.",1
"I dislike this professor with all of my guts. I advise you not to take her. Not even as your last resort. She is tedious, unorganized, and boring. She will drown you in work but barely have enough time to grade them. When the semester ends it's your fault for a bad grade and not her poor teaching.",0
"Prof Asbell taught this class with Stahly/Sosa and her section was incredibly easy to understand. She went over exactly what would be on the test and told us what to study during her lectures and after videos. The material was really interesting - gender fluidity, hip hop culture, etc - and was approachable and easy to talk to if help was needed.",1
Worse professor I have ever had. Period. His midterm and final were extremely hard and even tests you on the minor details of articles. Do not recommend this professor at all.,0
"Dennis Dennis Dennis...the 1st week or so of class you may want to kill him.  However by the end you will be signing up to take more classes with him.  He is extremely unorganized & he knows it.  But, if you ask lots of questions or need help with your work he will be of great assistance.  He is also funny once you get used to his humor.  I <3 him!",1
In groups you prepare a short presentationdebatediscussion for each class 'game'. It seems hard the first few weeks of class but it isn't really bad. This is honestly one of the best classes I have taken! Don't do all the readings-skim and use sparknotes. He is fair and a great teacher! No tests! Only 4 papers. This made me love history and liter,1
Professor Gentry is by far my favorite professor I've ever had. I loved his class so much. There was a good bit of reading but the passages were usually short and we always discussed them before taking quizzes. If you do your research and actually try for the speeches you'll get an A no problem.,1
"This guy is a joke!!! Over half of the class is going to get a D or lower for their final grade and he thinks thats a good thing....will never give a student an A its one of his policies, test are impossible and admits to making them that way on purpose...worst part is he is the only teacher that teaches this class!",0
This is a scoring course.Just listen when he teaches the problems and go through the previous papers posted on the web.He keeps u busy through out the sen with tests n assignments...but he's very easy.Can easily score an A :)He is also very helpful in case of doubts.,1
Alvarez is an excellent professor that is genuinely more interested in your learning than your ability to turn in a paper. Her topics are extremely interesting and I'd recommend taking a class with her. ,1
Great class.  Lots of writing.,1
"WOW. i literally met with her everyday after class, went to the writing center- and spent atleast 5 hours weekly studying for her class, Still got a C. She is ridiculous- and expects you to answer exactly the way she wants- or no points. Deflates grades- highest grade in the class was a b-. this is NOT ok",0
I hate every day of it.,0
"hated her, UNCLEAR, pulls questions on tests out of her you know what. RUN the other way!!!!",0
"Prof Allen is an amazing lecturer, EPSC20 is perfect for people who aren't very good at science, he was very understanding and accommodated coursework multiple times during the pandemic. Work is very easy, just stay on top of it and you'll be fine. I didn't do the readings and still passed. Just make sure you understand concepts and history.",1
"Awesome lady, very nice, very helpful, very easy grader. Her class could be very interesting but because no one ever participates in discussions and she lets them get away with it, it's very dull.",1
Mr. Lenhart is a great Professor. He is German so sometimes he is a little hard to understand but he knows it and doesn't have a problem repeating anything. 3 exams and a Final. Sometimes he gives extra credit questions on test or maybe extra credit assignment. Attendance not mandatory but he does give participation grade. Take His Classes!,1
Hard class but Crawley makes things very interesting!,1
He is honestly so nice and so caring. Concert reports due is very flexible. The best ever hands down. Take his class and respect him. Won't regret it.,1
"Worst professor I have taken till date. Very boring lectures, feel like they never end. Very unfair grader. Please save yourself by taking another prof for 1700.",0
"He kept the class very interesting with his personal accounts of trips he has taken, relevant music and cultural discussions, and was very funny and knowledgable all around.  He even brought in Pre-Columbian chocolate for us to try.  Go to class, participate, do your work, and you will probably get an A. He really is a great professor.",1
"I was NOT fond of her instructional approach. She seemed to rush through the material. When I asked for assistance or guidance she was not very optimistic or supportive. She's arrogant, not very approachable, judgmental, and called people out when they make a mistake speaking Spanish.  I've never had any issues with any professors, until this lady.",0
"I would like to see this professor care more about teaching the students about the material rather then grade acomputer generated test. Seems he doesn't want students to be lazy with his course, but yet his leading example is just that, unless you ask for help you will fail, unless you know the material at his level the tests are impossible to pass",0
"One of the most caring and engaging teachers I've ever met. His enthusiastic teaching style makes it seem like he genuinely cares about the material that he's teaching. He gives detailed feedback on your papers with solid constructive criticism and always makes time to go over your essays one-on-one. In short, you'll have a good time in his class.",1
"He has a thick accent and is hard to understand, especially when he is rushing through the chapters to get it over and done with. I HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND HIM. Dr. Ba is a knowledgable man and knows his stuff BUT he is deff not the one to teach.I might as well have taken a hybrid class.Also don't be surprise if he gets fustrated if u ask questions",0
"I love her, but she is too lenient! My class was very disruptive, I was always extremely agitated, but she never took action. Also because she lets you turn your homework in very late, students who should've never passed recieved A's. But if you need help, she will go out of her way to tutor you every day!",1
Cant follow along during lectures at all. Stay home and read ur textbook,0
"Reads directly from the slides, few relevant examples, too many assignments",0
I took him because a friend said so. He''s a very smart professor and one of my favorites. His tests aren''t too bad assuming you took notes and listened to his lectures.   He does lecture a lot and sometimes it can be boring. But pay attention take notes and come to class and you''ll get an A.,1
I absolutely loved Christina and I would most definitely take another art class with her! She is by far one of the funniest teachers I have ever had. She definitely knows what she is talking about and very helpful when it came to projects.,1
No Comments,1
"Her lectures are very dry and she gets off track easily. It takes her forever to start the lecture since she always has some random thing to say at the beginning of class. Her tests are by far the laziest I've seen which leads to the wording to be either convoluted, ambiguous, or unclear. Even the typography and appearance of her tests look bad.",0
He's a very chill guy. Really laid back and lots of extra credit. But there is a lot of homework and assignments in his class. He grades so slowly and is unorganized. You won't know your grade anytime soon no matter how much you bug him. I wish he would get organized. But other than that he's really chill and inspiring! Take him at least I passed.,1
"I took this course during the summer semester. The exams are tough. Take notes on everything in his lectures (what's on the Powerpoint AND what he says) and you should be okay. He only has four grades, which are all exams. I can't stress how important it is to copy down EVERYTHING. He gives lots of valuable information, though. Good luck! :)",1
"Terrific professor, easily the best I had at UCSD. Homeworks are usually quite difficult and don't always mesh perfectly with lecture. That said, Prof. Saintillan was always very accessible and I found going to office hours to be extremely helpful (if not required). His classes won't be a breeze, but they are well worth it in my opinion.",1
"If u luv lectures you'll luv Prof D. He is vry smart and knows his stuff! We had 4 major assignments (Quiz, Midterm, Resrch Paper, nd Final) He incorporates attendance in ur grade so it ""behooves"" you to go to class! Don't expect to leave early, EVER. U will B embarrased if ur phone goes off. He is best for mature students that are eager to learn.",1
"I was a little skeptical to take an online communications course, but I was pleasantly surprised. Every week there is a chapter reading and quiz on pearson revel, and either a journal prompt or a discussion board to respond to. There are also several extra credit opportunities. As long as you read the chapters and do the work, you'll do fine.",1
"Could never understand what he was saying with his accent. Even if I could the lectures were boring and couldn't pay attention. I studied the material myself outside of class. Pop quizzes but he drops 3- although he ended up dropping 4 and an exam because so many people were struggling. Bought the book but never used, all powerpoints are online.",0
"Prof. Hosley is so nice! Her class is extremely easy, yet very thought provoking and eye opening. She brings in really good guest speakers throughout the semester and she always makes lectures interesting. Show up to class and do the assignments, which are very easy, and you will get an A no problem.",1
"MR HOLT IS A GREAT  TEACHER (AND VERY GOOD LOOKING TOO) HE HAS THE BEST SENSE OF HUMOR OF ANY PROFESSOR I KNOW-HE LOVES TO JOKE AROUND. HE MAKES LEARNING COMPUTER SO MUCH FUN. TESTS ARE OVER COMPUTER BOOK AND OFFICE, WE GET TO USE ONE BOOK FOR THE TEST, AND HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS ARE EASY AND WE HAVE A WEEK TO COMPLETE. TAKE MR HOLT FOR A GREAT TIME.",1
"Almost impossible to fail this class, a class curve of B- brought my grade to an A+. There was also extra credit posting to class forumn.",1
"If you disagree with him, you're wrong. If you have to take a philosophy class find a different professor. He's boring and loves the sound of his own voice.",0
"Dr. Backus is a great professor. Little to non homework, and a quiz from the AP Stylebook each week. Lectures for most of class, but makes it engaging with conversation. She did not provide a tentative schedule for my semester, which I always like. But other than that good.",1
Great Professor! At the end of the semester if youve missed a certain number of times your letter grade is dropped. He also gives alot of pop quizzes. If you show up to class they are easy and so are the tests. You cannot make up anything but if you know you will miss he lets you take stuff early,1
"I took 3 classes with Freedman -- I'd take any class he teaches.  This is why I ended up with a minor in Anthropology.  The reading and work was not overwhelming, but very interesting and I got all A's.",1
"Very sweet, he has been teaching Physics for a long time, but still loves the subject. He is always ready to help even if he is eating lunch at the time. If I don't pass it is not his fault. I wished I thought as much about Physics as I do about him.",1
"I have to agree with some of the criticism here. Incredibly intelligent (seriously - very sharp), but if you want to witness an academic cult of personality at its most grovelling, take this class and watch how people who disagree with the professsor (there MUST be other poets than Holderlin and Rilke to examine) get eviscerated.",0
"FSE100 was an easy class among harder engineering courses. Muhilan is a pretty quiet prof with a thick Indian accent, but he is very helpful as are his TAs. You are assigned a group about a month into the class, and if you all get along, the class is very easy. Only two tests the whole semester! 7:30 AM labs were painful though, coffee is a must!",1
"Obviously those who don't want to do the work will give the worst reviews. Those who say she has an accent are plain ridiculous. She is very organized, gives wonderful lectures and has emailed back in a few minutes. So not sure what the complaints are about! Tough class, so do your WORK!!!!! She made an online class WORK! Great prof.",1
I am not a fan of Frazier. I was always early to class and I always participate but for some reason he did not like me and it was obvious. After every monologue he would bash me. He's not a good person and I definitely would not take him again. Quizzes are online which is nice but he doesn't let you see what you got wrong which is annoying.,0
"He is a really good teacher.  He is always available for any questions, and he usually curves the test depending on how everyone did. If you get to know him and he knows you are trying you will make a good grade. Test are off of the power points from class. If you get a chance take him!!",1
"I'm in his Math 70 class. If you're patient and not a jerk about his accent he's really a helpful guy. He has an awesome blue shirt I want to steal. I usually get out of class 1 hour early every day. Finish your worksheet and you're done. If you're not able to study by yourself dont take this class. You have to do some ""self educating""",1
"I took him for Swimming for Fitness. The class was fun and he explained how to do strokes perfectly without even getting in the water. If you miss more than 3 classes you fail the class. If you show up, participate, and do the modules on time you should pass. Do not take this class if you have another class right after it though",1
"Decent professor, only does examples from book in class so you basically teach yourself all the material. Material isn't too difficult. Little homework so grade is based off midterm and final only.",1
"He is absolutely awesome! He's very understanding and down to earth. The class was very opininated and sometimes it got very tense, but he always knew how to calm things down and put us back on track. I loved his class!",1
I took him in his first year teaching arc students and I have to say the best first experience as an architecture student I have yet to have. He cares so much about you and give great feed back and ideas for your projects. Much better than Bob. If you're lucky take this young man he is the GOAT.,1
She is such an amazing professor!!! I am taking my history seminar with her and have learned so much. I have learned not only information about the topic but important skills like doing research on my own and putting together a professional research paper. She has helped me so much in office hours and I wish I could take another class with her.,1
Very passionate about subject; enjoyable person to be around and learn from.,1
"Even though I have previous calculus experience, it all left my brain the second rogers started talking. Think you know how to do something? Think again!! Good luck getting 10/10 on anything because he will always find one little thing to dock off. Tests? 8 pages at least and does not relate to any of the problems that we did in class. Good luck!!!",0
"Interesting man, probably shouldn't be a teacher though. Does not believe that grades are important to his students. Class notes are random and unorganized. Tests are nearly impossible because he gives no insight as to what will be on them. Projects are useless, time consuming and have nothing to do what is discussed in class. DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS",0
Mrs. Elfring is a GREAT professor. She cares so much about her students and wants them to succeed throughout the semester. The feedback she gives on papers helps you become a better. She was the first professor that I actually enjoyed coming to English class. I highly recommend taking Elfring!!,1
Take this professor you won't regret it. Excellent lecturer and grader.,1
Lecture heavy but good class and easy,1
"Not a bad professor, he mostly just reads from slides, gives homework fairly often but it doesnt take that long to finish it. TA's never graded anything on time which made studying mostly last minute. The exams are pretty tough, but his grading is fair, will give lots of partial credit.",1
"I seriously reccoment taking any classes taught by mr brooks. He is a down to earth country boy and is very respectable. He requires work from you, but if you put in effort then you will get an A.",1
"This instructor is very involved, makes the course fun and engaging. Truly an outstanding professor!!!",1
"she's a very nice lady who is always willing to help. i took the class online, so the fact that she responds quickly to emails was essential. the class wasn't difficult per se, but there's a ton of material to absorb. luckily she allowed the exams to be open note since it was an online class.",1
excellent teacher if you didn't think you could draw. you will think otherwise after his class.,1
"I was excited coming into this class, but quickly realized it would be one of the worst classes I've taken at MSU. I don't feel the lectures accurately represent what he tests on. He is a touch grader and wants you to extrapolate your own answers from the little info he does give. Hard to get ahold of through email. All around a bit of a let down.",0
"I'm not really interested in biology, but Maher makes this class pretty painless. His powerpoints are verbatim from the book and if you do the homework, you'll do fine on the tests. Going to class is necessary though, since his ""attendance"" grade is from questions he asks in class and he does not announce when he will take attendance.",1
"Dr. Mike is a truly awesome professor. I'm not a math wiz by any means and physics is really hard for me, but Dr. Mike is funny and honestly wants his students to do well. Class is five times a week compared to four but that leaves, usually, four days review before an exam. His reviews are very good and very comprehensive of the exams. Recommended!",1
"Ms. Spencer was very clear on what needs to be completed in order to pass the class. There is a ton of reading - a chapter per week - as well as a weekly discussion, homework, and quiz related to the chapter. If that sounds like a lot of work it's because it is, however Ms. Spencer is very forthcoming about this fact at the start of the class.",1
"Course is easy! Professor is absolutely terrible, and for the final makes you hand write out the problems and copy scan to her.",0
"She is an amazing prof, her lectures were amazing and despite being a T and R class, the classes felt very short. She does mark quite hard on her exams and essays.  You can't skip class, she won't post the notes. And study the book like the crazy.",1
Dr. Hill by far one of the best professor's ive ever had in my years at college. She is very helpful and kind,1
"An absolutely excellent professor. She has a pdf of notes, practice problems, and reference tables for each chapter that you cover. If I'm being honest, I never opened the textbook because this document she created was so thorough. She has the patience of mountains, and will answer every question. She is very in tune with the students' needs.",1
"She was a great teacher and an even better friend.  I will remember her for a lifetime. Plus, she very pretty, hmhm.",1
"This may be putting the cart ahead of the horse but I wanted to forewarn anyone signing up for this class soon. IT. IS. TOUGH. Professor Bliss is very kind but doesn't go easy on you. Get the Skoolers reviews, study your face off and, if you're so inclined, pray.",1
"Literally every single lecture was a prerecorded video from another semester. I could have learned the same stuff from youtube, why did I pay Oakland thousands of dollars to watch videos. I have never witness a professor care less then Jonathan Maisonneuve. I'm struggling to find words to describe this sorry excuse of a professor. Just don't.",0
pretty hard. good luck! youll need some with this course,0
"Great guy, really helpful and nice. Down to earth. I wish i had him for ENG 105.",1
"A lot of people didnt like Isabelle, and while she wasnt the best lecturer, I really liked how she set up the lectures. We would have a break halfway through class to work on sample problems of the material we just covered, which were similar to the ones on the final. I really appreciated this. The final also wasnt too bad!",1
"Professor Soniak's class had a lot of extensive readings, but they were all high quality and informative. There are multiple papers that require research and analysis. The assignments all have clear grading criteria. He gave constructive feedback to help me understand new material and form a deeper understanding of politics.",1
"Michele is wonderful. Her demeanor in the classroom is one of respect. She is brilliant, but never makes you feel like your opinion matters less than hers. She grades tough at times, but is always very clear about criterion, and gives you ample opportunity to succeed as long as you put the time in. I respect and admire her greatly.",1
"A jolly nerdy fellow. He's a little strange, but does a great job teaching the topic. Assignments, labs and lectures are very organized. Very pleased with the course.",1
"John is the best teacher in Saint mary's! He does not take favorites as one said. He marks fairly well and based on how good you write or how good you participate in class. We had 2 essays, and one presentation. The class was 2 hours and I loved every minuite of every class. I normally don't like english and it was mandatory for me to take.",1
"I found that Professor Smith was very disorganized. It felt like he didn't have a solid plan for the semester. He's not the best at lecturing, but if you go to him and talk one on one, the feedback and help you'll get is very good. Definitely not a professor I would take again, but he's a very nice guy.",0
"Dr. Bailey has been my favorite professor thus far. Really funny, super helpful, and easy-going.",1
I really enjoyed this class. His sense of humor made it fun and lively!!,1
"Mrs Sias is very organized and her class is easy. In her class youll have to listen to a lot of podcasts and read a book from which youll do the majority of your assignments from. She does take attendance every class, so youll need to show up.",1
"Professor Juana Gonzalez-Santos is a very good and caring professor. She taught Bio270 at the University of Toronto (Animal Physiology) and made very fair tests. Textbook readings are optional and lectures are extremely helpful. Although the professor has a bit of an accent and the lectures aren't too organized sometimes, it was a great experience.",1
Professor Sposeto is very kind and clearly cares about her students! She works hard and is always doing fun activities to make learning Italian interesting. She assigns a decent amount of homework but nothing overwhelming or unnecessary. She makes Italian understandable and the class always goes by quickly. I would highly recommend this class!,1
Elle fait des PowerPoint très clairs et explique bien la matière. Je n'ai pas du tout lu le livre de la session parce que ses ppt sont très complets. C'est mieux d'être présent en classe pour comprendre. Matière semble compliquée à priori mais c'est en fait très simple si on suit bien en classe. Pas très dynamique ni captivante mais explique bien.,1
"Taylor is fine. I took her during her first semester teaching, and she is still a little rough around the edges. She's a very nice woman and helps students if they ask for it. Feel comfortable enrolling in her class.",1
"Not just a teacher but a friend.  Had 2 classes with her and decided to pursue ComS as a result. Always willing to help.  At times, lectures a little vague, but if you ask for more info, she always expounds.  Definately take for ComS3, Try and take for ComS 100B if she is teaching it.",1
Take a different professor. That is all.,0
He uses finance and economics to explain marketing; very insightful professor!,1
"Nemat is a very engaging professor. He is one of the few engineering professors I have had who truly cares to spend time making sure the students understand the material, absolutely. He will tend to spend times on material that seems simple, however, it is with good reason. FUNNY which is great for eng. class. Exams very close to HW & pract. ones.",1
Dr. Tavvs is a small glistening sliver of hope in this scarlet hell that is Rutgers University. 1 in 1000 teachers gives a crap in this school and Dr. Tavvs is that one teacher. It is with great respect that I write this review. But if he doesnt fit in his schedule you could still attend his lectures / become his friend.,1
The content of this course is very interesting but unfortunately the prof for this course makes it hard to find interesting. Plus she makes the midterms worth 45% of your grade with nothing in between to fix your grade if your screw up. Plus there are many slides and not enough time for notes on each bring a camera and lots of memory or dont takeit,0
"Fantastic! Cares about people, the problems, working. Wonderful",1
"Matthew is by far the best professor Ive ever had! Hes so funny and so caring about all of his students. His class is my favorite, I love everything about it. It has more of a chill vibe, there is a lot of discussion but you dont have to talk, listening is great too. I have learned a lot in his class about things that are actually important",1
"Very nice person, easy to be friends with. Don't let it fool you though, he is here to make sure you're learning. 10/10",1
"Fun class, his lectures can be really enthralling. He cares about students and really wants to help. Tests weren't ridiculously hard, but def need to study for",1
Lab exercises are given each week as meetings are set for once a week. Online classes were a waste of time as she spent 20 minutes to barely explain and put us into breakout rooms. Constantly bringing us in and out. Talks a lot about other things and will speed through topics. Will probably yell and be energetic. Teacher is okay and understanding.,1
I took Alisa for math 108 and from the very beginning found her very hard to stay interested.  She was very monitone.  She also rarely worked problems on the board unless asked.  I went from 2 prior classes with an A to having to withdraw from her class.  I would NEVER recommend her to anyone.  She is super nice though but that's all I can say.,0
"Worst prof. ever. Made the class extremely difficult. Doesn't know what he is talking about. Not clear, not helpful, just a all around D!ck. Made sexest commments which he thought nothing of. He should be fired before given another class to teach. If you want to fail take him, if you want to pass and understand the material, stay clear. DO NOT TAKE",0
"FA'09 GREAT person, Good teacher. She LOVES Biology! People state that she ""rambles"" but it is entertaining, really. I ADORE her and am actually quite P.O.'d she isn't teaching 113 of the series. Taking 112 now. Go to class, take notes and read the book. Ask questions if you have them. Multiple choice tests which are not easy so know your stuff.",1
"No textbook! Let me just say, this guy doesn't have a negative bone in his body. (At least in a classroom environment) He is light-hearted, energetic, and truly cares. He presents problems in a way that actually has use in real life. I always dreaded conversions, however, we tackled the subject within the first week! Bro. Relieved my math anxiety!!",1
"Professor Osoba is one of my favorite professors I've ever had. He makes it a point to learn everyone's names and get to know his students. He's very high energy and there is a lot of information to absorb, but I think if you pay attention, do your readings, and actively participate in class, this is an easy A.",1
AVOID HER AT ALL COST!!!!!,0
TOO MUCH PAPERS! This class is definitely not an easy A if you are not good at writing. I totally regret taking this class.,1
"Vincent is the best instructor that I have had at Baker. He gives great feedback plus additional information and links to help understand the material. He loves to teach and it shows. I highly recommend taking a course with him, you will not be disappointed.",1
Take literally anyone else. Chemistry is a strong subject of mine and I am struggling to do well in this class. Get a tutor if you wind up with Brown because he does not teach what's on the test. We spent 2 lectures on a chapter that was supposedly on a test just to find out on the test that it didn't matter. Do not take Dr. Brown,0
"I loved taking HKIN 226 with Angie! She is so passionate about what she teaches and she genuinely cares for us students. I would definitely recommend taking one of her classes. I wouldn't suggest assuming that her classes are 'easy.' You definitely need to put the work in if you wish to do well. Overall, this class was very inspiring.",1
"She isn't a tough grader but she's very politically correct. Often brings up discussions about race, discrimination, and the like which can sometimes make you uncomfortable. She's a decent professor overall.",0
She is Awful! She told our class that we could not ask questions during class because she had to many slides to go through. She mows through 150 slides on average a day. Rediclous,0
"Absolutely fabulous teacher.  She's extremely professional, organized, helpful, and even after grading all those papers and being under so much stress she kept things together so well.  I hope to take a class with her again.",1
Basic writing class. Five essays. Flexible,1
"Buck was a great Professor. He had pretty clear lectures and made sure everyone was on the same page. He will occasionally make mistakes on the board during lecture and if you correct him he will give you extra points on the next exam. Show up to class, take notes, and study the sample exams he gives before the actual exam. He made Calc 2 enjoyable",1
"Professor Lockett is amazing! I didnt do so well on the tests however, I was able to partake in every extra credit assignment so that helped me achieve a satisfactory grade in the class.",1
"Professor Eubanks is extremely knowledgeable in his field. This was one of the most interesting courses I've taken at NCTC. It requires a lot of reading and writing, but the majority of the material is highly fascinating. There is no textbook required as the professor provides all of the reading material, so you save some money there.",1
She's the WORST prof I have ever had in my life. Seriously terrible. She reads off the slides and tests you on pictures but wont put them on D2L. She doesn't answer questions properly and tells you to look in the textbook. Her lectures are 100 pages per lecture and they are PACKED with information. Midterms 45% of grade. 10/10 do not recommend.,0
Easily the best math teacher I have ever had.  Explains things very clearly and is more than willing to help you if you are confused with something.  My only complaint was he focuses on the theory of the math about as much as he does the application of it.,1
"Overall, she was a decent teacher. Her test reviews are pretty much exactly what is going to be tested. Only bad thing is I'm afraid I am not going to be prepared for BIO 226. Also, her grades are not always solid. They are likely to change, but she gives bonus points on tests.",1
"The guy hasn't given an A on an essay this semester.  Makes you turn in a rough draft then tears all your ideas apart.  No chance to get anything higher than a 3.3.  Anyone who says ""A B is a good grade"" in his syllabus is not a teacher to take.",0
"I took his US Govt class as a freshman and then later took him again for an upper division class. His teaching has definitely improved (more organized, doesn't seem nervous), he's a nice guy, he will work with you if you go to office hours. He knows his stuff. Would definitely recommend taking his classes.",1
"Great professor. You can tell he really loves Italy and that he prides himself on being a scholar. He doesn't teach out of the book. Dr. Drake teaches you how to really think and break down a subject so that you can form your own opinions. Exams are bluebook. You state your opinion and back it up, theres not really right and wrong answers.",1
"Great teacher. I wasn't looking forward to this class but this professor is amazing! Weekly assignments are due every week, but she makes the assignments entertaining and gives good feedback and suggestions. Great teacher!",1
"First off I got an A in this course. But I don't feel like I learned all that much. THere are way too many moodle assignments (especially focused on small subtopics barely mentioned in the book), come on many of us have work too. Exams are open book, but again you don't learn anything if you take exams that way. ",0
Possibly the single stupidest individual I've ever been unfortunate enough to encounter.,0
"he doesn't reply to emails often, but makes the effort if a student is in need of some attention like retaking an exam and such. His notes aren't that organized, made grand mistakes on poppers and deadlines so this is pretty much self taught. College alg is decent, not too hard not too easy either. Just study by yourself honestly.",0
"You need to read a lot by yourself. His grading most on lecture quizzes, but just be careful. And lab quizzes are not hard.",0
"doable if not working full time and taking 3 other classes. Every chapter needs to be read, and quiz taken, along with unit exams. Midterm and Final are proctored. Some instructions were not clear so ask as you go along. Consider this class as two in one by the amount of work and effort that needs to be put in. Avg studied 5 hours a day. Good luck!",1
Awesome professor. His test cover alot of material which can be difficult to remember at times.,1
Very caring prof! Would def take another course with him. The W  (writing) was frustrating at times though...Assignments were weighed quite heavily and tough at times.,1
"Totally awesome teacher, funny, not too serious, easy work and easy tests, barely any studying needed and he's not too bad to look at either.",1
"Mrs. Jackson is one of the best GCC has to offer. She is incredibly real, makes class and lecture easy to relate to life. She makes you question a lot of things and most of all CARES about all you have to say and think. She usually replies quickly through canvas and always leaves feedback. If you show effort on your assignment youll always get 100%",1
"If you are passionate about environmental topics, then take one of Lisa Jo's classes. In addition to cultivating your passion and encouraging you to express it, her classes will teach you about a variety of important topics. There is also a focus on applying learning to projects that engage students in solving real life environmental issues.",1
She doesn't make it easy to approach her or ask questions. Condescending remarks are in every lecture. She keeps you the whole class time and rambles. There is no acknowledgement for effort. I'm considering dropping this class which would stop me from graduating this semester. I'm a 3.8 GPA student and have never failed a test until now.,0
"Kristi Wilkum is an actual real, down to earth person and makes her classes fun and relaxing. She engages students and somehow does it in a way that makes everyone WANT to talk and be involved. She has also managed to make a public speaking class fun and enjoyable, and relatively low-stress. Yes, I said public speaking and fun in the same sentence.",1
"Professor Lee is a great instructor, she teaches well to where the students understand. she gives extra credit assignments to help improve grades. Which helps students that are struggling.I do wish she was available to tutor outside of class it would be helpful because her style of teaching is understanding but some students need extra attention.",1
Prof Sanborn is a good prof. She can sometimes be all over the place in the lecture and gets off track but eventually get back on track. If you have any questions ask them!! She will do everything she can to help you understand. I would recommend her to anyone. I took her for both intro acc classes and got A's in both. ,1
Mr. Morley is one of the toughest teaches i have had in the fine arts dept. he's mean and his critiques are very tough...but it totaly makes you a better photographer in the end. Morley taught me more in one semester than the other instuctours have taught me in nearly 2 years...,1
"She is a great Professor. Clear on what she wants you to do for homework. She checks your homework and returns them with corrections if any. Her  exams is exactly what is taught in her class. If you do your homework and participate in class, you will do fine.",1
"Great class, great prof.",1
If you want someone who is never on time to class and never grades assignments then this is your teacher! I took her for comp 2 in the spring of 2016 and the only grade she entered was our final. I still have no clue what I made on any of her essays because she never posted them or have them back!,0
Super easy class. I never had a problem with the professor. He was pretty straight forward and would help if you asked. He is a nice guy and pretty laid back.,1
-_- he never responds to my emails and get ready to read 40+ pages in a huge textbook with small print every week and doing a lot more bs a week DONT choose this guy,0
"I had him for Global Patterns of Racism. He randomly assigns grades. He does not give good feedback and when he does, you can't read it because his handwriting is not legible. Many quizzes, a few essays. Very tough grader.",0
"Amazing professor, take his classes and see.",1
"She is definitely a hard grader and expects a lot from the students. However, she has a lot of useful comments to give and her anecdotes are really interesting. Whenever I have approached her she's always been very compassionate and understanding.",1
Dr. Gelderloos is a thoughtful professor who truly loves the material he teaches. He is not very easy but not hard; he moves through a lot of material quickly. Going to class and keeping up with the readings will guarantee you a good grade.,1
"sometimes hard to understand but super helpful, even outside of class. You get good grades by doing your homework properly and studying the review exam guides. Not showing up to class means missing out on important facts about projects. She is a fair grader.",1
"Steve is a smart guy, but sometimes that means he'll spend 30 minutes of class time trying to figure out a difficult problem that we would never even need to know. It's difficult to try to put his examples/lectures into notes, and you'll probably have to reteach most things to yourself on your own time. But he's a pretty easy grader and a nice guy.",1
"Class is darn near pointless. He never worked out one single problem in class, he just throws up a sheet of paper with how to do it for 20 seconds ",0
Dr. Thomas is a wonderful professor!! I had her during her first semester at Tech. She makes anatomy easy and interesting. She also enjoys helping her students in any way she can.,1
A great teacher who cares for us.,1
He does not explain topics well. his lectures are no help at all I had to learn everything from the textbook even though i attended every lecture. The examples he goes through in class he uses solutions for the textbook which is not helpful at all.,0
"He moves through class slowly, which can be boring. However it is beneficial, you do develop a strong understanding of the material. He does not give a lot of homework nor the answers to the textbook. Therefore it can be easy to get high 70s too low 80s, but it can be difficult to achieve a higher grade.",1
She's a great professor. Also really cute.,1
Great class! Mrs. Berry is willing to help you understand the material.,1
He gives us a 20 minutes presentation to do and 8 page research paper when the class is just elective. He should have given us a option to choose between presentation or writing the paper. Not do both. 12 people drop out of his class because of it.,0
No Comments,1
"students do more teaching then teacher.  even if the student is wrong the teacher doesn't even correct the students. class average for midterm is 68%, most people are failing. I have two As and a B in my other classes and I am barley passing with a C.  takes forever to grade. only half way though semester and not liking it.",0
"Professor Guetter understands in his Fundamental Concepts class that no one is there for a math major. The final was optional and he gave us two class periods to finish our very small homework assignments. He made mathematics interesting for once. Sometimes I wished I was getting more for my money, but I got the credit without hassle, so.",1
"Assignments were easy overall. However, at the end of the semester, he changed his grade breakdown from what the syllabus originally said. His grading was really inconsistent and many students received grades lower than they actually earned. I would avoid this professor for this class.",0
Took him online in the summer. One Discussion Board and one quiz. TAKES FOREVER TO GRADE THE DISCUSSION BOARDS!!!!!!!! Doesn't reply to emails. He would tell us a grade would be up the next day and its never there,1
He is a very patient professor. He always help students a lot. The lecture is very detailed. Recommend to take his class.,1
"I love Professor McIver!  She is awesome!  She tries to make it as easy as possible to learn a second language, and she's super helpful.  She does use the book & the website a lot, and there's a fair bit of homework, but the tests are usually pretty easy & she drops the lowest grade.  She's a really good teacher, take if you actually want to learn.",1
"Dave is the man. Show up to class and take good notes. Econnect is the easiest component of this class, so DO NOT miss the deadlines its not that hard. I would say where I see most students struggling is with Mike's Bikes. Get help with it right away if you don't understand anything.",1
"3 tests-Drops the lowest, a final and attendance. SHOW UP FOR THIS CLASS. 5 random attendance days. He gives you the answers to the exams so you don't need to pay attention or study, just memorize them before and you will pass. Final is a mix of all 3 review sheets so memorize all three and you will do extremely well. Literally a Study Hall. Easy A",1
Best professor i've had throughout all my time at USC! Not an easy class at all but he explains things very well during lecture and emphasizes what we do and dont need to know for our exams. My biggest advice: attend lecture every class & go to his office hours! He is extremely kind to all his students and wants them all to succeed.,1
"Professor Zeman is awesome! She's super interesting, intelligent, nice, helpful and funny. She truly wants everyone to do well. Her tests are very doable but u should study. I highly recommend her for any bio course she may be teaching. You'll be glad that u took her. She's the best science teacher at rcc!",1
"If you are looking for a traditional class atmosphere, this isn't for you. However, I learned more in this class than I have in all others. Mayor Street and his TA (Jeff Carroll who is a professor himself) make a great team and are EXTREMELY committed to their students.. Everything you need to know about local government is within this class!!!!!!!",1
Will read ninety percent of poets and one or two outside novels for any given period and tested on all of it.,0
Dr. Parker was the perfect prof for this class. He is energetic and cares about his students.,1
Helps when I need,1
Her online course is one of the hardest to navigate which is ironic because of the class she teaches. If you ask about something on her course page that you couldn't find she'll make you go on a scavanger hunt through the clusterbomb of useless information on her page rather than taking 5 seconds to tell you. Also more homework than any class.,0
"She's a nice person, but an awful teacher. She talks waayyy too fast and goes into too much detail about the chapters. The homework/studying is brutal. If you're not a genius, don't bother wasting your time and money on her classes.",0
She is pretty funny sometimes but also is a little unclear on what she wants in your essays.,1
A lot of work and reading involve. Syllabus and blackboard very clear and detailed. Professor helpful and answer emails in a short time.,1
"Dr. Gentry is one of a kind. Instead of lecturing all class, he lets us form our own opinions by debating about the topic at hand. I looked forward to this class everyday. Just do your work and don't half-ass it and you'll pass with flying colors.",1
"THIS CLASS IS GREAT, SHE'S SO NICE. YOU DO ALOT OF FUN THINGS AND JUST KICK BACK. HIGHLY RECCOMENDED!! (TAKE HER)",1
Gives out a lot of work. Super heavy lectures. Monotoned. Class feels super long. Doesn't take time to know students. Very dull teacher. No motivation.,0
Very helpful if you put in the effort,1
"Prof. Acosta was awesome! Specially with the transition to online learning. In the beginning of the semester when we were face to face, her lectured were straight to the point and she went at a decent pace. She answered all the questions I had in class and replied to all of my emails within enough time.",1
"Japanese is a hard language. It's not Kubota-sensei's fault if you're not doing well, she gives you everything you need to succeed. Do the homework, do the practice assignments. Read over the material BEFORE class. She's good at what she does, and she is actively helpful if you just ask.",1
21. Which of the following [b]statements[/b] is/are least untrue? a) Dr. Lai's class is easy.  b) Laboratories are not tremendously difficult.  c) Dr. Lai's class is [b]somewhat[/b] boring.   d) all of the above.  e)  a) and c) only.,1
"Dr. Green has completely changed the way I write. He inspires his students to say and argue for the weirdest things possible, to find what interests them in a text and run with it, and to be confident in what they have to say. I can only hope to be half the teacher he is someday. Take his class.",1
He sucks. He puts his religious beliefs on his test and just sucks a lot.,0
He is a good professor! His online class is quite easy if you read the assigned chapters.  His book Social Welfare Policy And Social Programs is a very interesting book to read.,1
lots of class participation at 8 AM,1
"Overall, super easy class! Make sure you attend every class, she may give random assignments. She is friendly and easygoing. Returns papers back with great feedback. ",1
one of the best classes at oneonta. also made me much better on the guitar. take this class,1
Extremely unorganized. Not timely with handing back grades from anything else besides tests. Reads off a packet each lecture as his lesson. You come out very unprepared for the departmental exams (which are tricky). Expectations in class are unclear. Take anyone else but him. You won't learn anything and you'll struggle on the tests.,1
"The class itself was fine, he seems like a really nice guy and a nice and easy teacher. That being said he is an older man and doesn't seem to be up to date on terminology. He continually used the word r*tarded, called people who self harm ""cutters"" and blatantly hated people with personality disorders. His class is an easy A but not a safe space.",0
"He is nice professor but he really need to change his teach style. He is a kind of professor who hope students to go to his office hour. If you go to, he love talking with you and answer clearly. And his exam has many works. So, good luck on it.",1
"Kathy is one of the best journalism profs I've taken at CMU. She is very knowledgable and is fun to listen to. She gives quizzes online and does in class and out of class assignments. As long as you show up and present her with some effort, you will pass. I ended up with over 100% based off extra credit opportunities she offered.",1
Knows his stuff! Informal lectures and discussions all to focus on what students are interested in. Highly recommend.,1
"Very polite woman, gives good feedback, and is very clear about her expectations. She does take attendance however it does not effect your grade. Each week there is a chapter quiz and chapter questions to answer. There are also 4 Microsoft projects (Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and Access) a midterm and a final. Pretty easy class.",1
"Took the class to boost my GPA, ended up in a multi collegiate speech competition where I took first place in the category I entered into. Very exciting! All thanks to Connie's encouragement to go for it.",1
VERY BORING! Avoid him if you can and use high school calc notes. I only took Pre Calc and they was more helpfull than anything he could offer!,0
No Comments,0
"Do the homework on time and you can assure that you will pass. I passed this class because of that, and on prior knowledge of physics from high school. I only missed one class and learned almost nothing from him. Tests are nothing like the homework whatsoever. He gets frustrated when students don't understand a concept he thinks is simple.",0
"The best teacher, he is the gem of the IM department. Will help you no matter what you need. 10/10 would hug",1
"Très bon professeur, très expérimenté et explique assez clairement. Il a une personnalité agréable et est plutôt flexible. Faites beaucoup d'exercices du manuel et vous réussirez sans problème.",1
just don't do it,0
He's a nice guy. He's always willing to help his students pass and do well in his class. He drops the lowest exam.,1
"I was extremely dissatisfied with this course and I am disappointed because I was looking forward to the material (St. Francis). I would not take a course with this professor again. He is intelligent, but lacks the social skills to maintain a proper classroom environment. It felt like a dysfunctional family; I dreaded going to class each day.",0
"Only had two zeros on homework out of more than 10, turned in everything I needed to, just wasn't one of her ""favorites"" and didn't suck up to her so I made a C. Undeservingly. One of my friends got the same grades as me and made higher because she was close to her. Is very unorganized. Gave us no idea of our grade, and grading was so inconsistent",0
"Very respectful and easy professor. His lectures are very long, but the way he went about them I for sure take a class of his again.",1
i took building construction with him online. its like he wasnt even there. he never talked to us about anything. we just did the assignments and got no feedback. this was my 1st online class and i never want to take another 1. i had no motivation to log on from my house and i was always late with everything. he gave everyone As onthe paper though.,0
Really a good teacher that challenges you to put your best foot forward even though I made a D. I think Mrs. Elise is a great teacher my problem was timing on the exit exam I struggled and I'm still struggling,1
"I really struggled in his class. I only missed a few classes and still had issues understanding what he was teaching. You can tell that he knows the information, it's just sometimes confusing to understand the way he explains things. He always offered to help me in and out of class, but I found it easier to get a tutor.",0
He creates a very unwelcoming environment. There's two professors who teach this class and both do a terrible job explaining the material. Hough doesn't even teach the class yet he's considered a professor. During office hours he comes off as very rude and makes you feel dumb for asking certain questions. He does not care about his students,0
"McDonald is the best professor I've had so far in college. His lectures are interesting and funny. Only real grades are the mid-term, final, large 12pg paper and small 8pg paper. His exams are tricky and he grades more on concepts rather than facts. Study the examples he uses in class and try to see how you could recreate those experiments.",1
"Nice Professor, Helped me on my journey. I am doing much better now.",1
"Brilliant theoretical math professor, but can't really teach lower level math. His accent makes following already shaky lectures very difficult. Asking questions is pointless, he doesn't understand you any better than you understand him. If you already know calculus or read the book, you can scratch by.",0
"Bliss is so helpful and really strives to allow students to do well. I wouldnt use Skoolers, it honestly doesnt help much for this class. Just know how to do the homework and attend the study sessions and youll get an A!",1
"Avoid taking her for Phisiology. She is extremely horrible instructor for this subject and should not be allowed to teach it. She doesn't answer her emails, she is not thorough about what is covered on her exams. The study guides are almost useless. She is not very clear in explaining the material on her PowerPoints. This is by far the worst class!",0
"Mike was my first informatics class I've taken at UW, but has definitely gotten me much more involved. Ended up with a 3.7 which was decent, but took enough out of the class that the grade didn't matter as much. Start assignments early, they are much tougher than the lecture or textbook.",1
"Professor Liao was very helpful this semester, especially with the craziness of COVID going on. He was very clear, thorough, and would go back if needed. He will answer any questions you have, and would definitely recommend taking him.",1
"He is really smart, but does not know how to get across the information. He expects memorization over over 180 pgs of text for the first test-- and this is 100 level!!  I am a good student, and probably will not pass this class.  Wish he had a teaching mentor to help him decrease content and make it LEVEL-appropriate.  It really is too bad.",0
"Angie is so delightful, I really enjoyed going to her classes. They are the best HKIN classes to take. She works really hard to connect and relate to the students. 10/10",1
"She is a lovely lady, but man does she grade hard. She took points off because I forgot to put the accent over the word résumé on my cover page. Other than her old style teaching ways, and can't get ahold of her by email she is alright.",0
"Prof. Guttman was great and I certainly would take him again given the opportunity. I wasn't looking forward to economics one bit before this class but once Prof. Guttman walked me through it I fell in love with the subject. The class isn't too bad if you show up, participate, and do the work. He offers plenty of extra credit and second chances.",1
"Dr. Jones is extremely intelligent when it comes to what she knows. She may come off as having an attitude at first, but when you actually talk to her, shes really amazing. She cares deeply about her students, and helps to teach them more than what the class requires. There are 4 tests, a presentation, and a paper. Start on the paper early!",1
"This professor actually made me like math & i always hated the subject its not the easiest but if you show up to class & pay attention you will pass. He has a GREAT attitude coming into class to teach everyday which helped me be more attentive. He's a super nice guy and will help u out alot if you go to his office hrs, I LOVE HIM take him if u can",1
"I took this class once a week and every week we turned in a 1 page homework assignment. Had the midterm and the final based on a study guide and her lectures. Her class is really straight forward so as long as you're doing your work and participating during lecture, you'll definitely enjoy this class.",1
"Teaches the things you need to know. Works for the student to be successful. Always available through email, if not in person. A lot of homework, but I recommend him for anyone willing to put in an effort.",1
Professor Polster's translation class was excellent. I would highly recommend it for anyone who wants to take their language skills to the next level or are considering a professional career using German. She's super nice and always has a positive attitude. A+,1
"First professor rating Ive ever done, but needed to for this one. Genuinely cares about his students and is intelligent and humble. I respect this professor greatly for his genuine caring for his students learning. Would gladly take again.",1
Professor Laucella is really nice and a great professor. As long as you do the work and you should be fine. It's an Easy A class.,1
"Very helpful, she wrote the book, literally.",1
"Jana is very helpful, she has high but reasonable expectations of her students. She is very helpful, emails back quickly, returns graded papers quickly with useful comments.",1
"Marks was always willing to answer questions and explain things over again. He's a super understanding and laid back guy, but still a really effective prof. Definitely recommend.",1
"The class isn't super difficult, if you put in the effort. He's really happy about helping to understand the topic and willing to meet to answer questions. One of the best professors I've had for Fin 4410 and Fin 5250",1
"Not only a great art teacher, but a great art department chairperson. I hope she'll be around MU for a long time, because she can help a LOT of students.",1
"If you do the work, you'll get a good grade. I learnt a lot in her class. Professor Ferguson has a lot of knowledge and it's always interesting to here what she has to say. If you participate more then she'll communicate with you more (naturally), she really doesn't play favorites! If you don't take a class with her you're missing out !!!",1
"the class isn't over yet, so far I think she's there for the money, she is nice but not very nice. nor clear too- a couple of times told us something important right AFTER the quiz. She really emphasize the timing on tests too 5 or 7 minutes means 5 or 7 minutes and maybe 1 second! She is cool but can be nicer!",1
"Mr. Ross is an amazing professor. He is very good at explaining the content and wants all of his students to succeed. Unless you don't show up to anything, you can easily get an A or B. You can email him at 2 in the morning and he will respond within 20 minutes. There are a lot of group problems and there is extra credit on exams and quizzes.",1
"Super easy class with a good professor! Tests are listening tests and not actually normal tests, which was great. A couple of easy essays and some concerts to go to and that's it! I found the topics to be very interesting, although some people probably won't. You don't need a strong musical background to understand the material, although it helps.",1
"Professor Kendall was a great intro drafting teacher. He's got a lot of experience in Mechanical drafting and it shows. Very clear outline for the semester, had no problems passing the class. Looking forward to future classes with him.",1
"Study from the get go, his test are super hard and you have to study or you won't pass. He gives test and one paper. So if you fail the test you're going to have a hard time passing. I went to his office so many times asking for extra credit or something, he doesn't give it. Will do study sessions if you ask for them. Thankful I passed with a C. ",1
He made me face a lot of my fears with swimming and he was always very nice and ready to give good feedback. The way he grades is harsh and you have a skills test at the end and I do not believe that's fair.,1
Took Ms. Wells for math 115. She's an amazing instructor. Will taking her for Statistics in the fall. Recommend her to everybody. She explains well and has lots of patience.,1
"The teacher gives NO feedback. Do not expect clear instructions or responses. Poor communication for a communications teacher. Other than that, the class is an easy class as long as you participate. Also, when you try to find out information about your grade, you will receive an extremely rude response.",0
"I took her online Abnormal Psychology class in the Spring Semester, and I liked it. The content was really interesting, and theres not too much work. Theres normally a discussion and a fifteen question timed open-note quiz on the chapter each week. Overall, I would definitely take it again.",1
Amazing teachers. Does her best to help students.,1
"As with any other subjects, it only becomes hard if you do not study.  Ms. Johansen is very sweet and very professional, and makes the class interesting and easy.  She is an excellent professor.",1
"Professor Pangalozzi is a very caring professor, she assigns a lot of readings but you can skim through papers. As long as you demonstrate knowledge of the readings and participate, she will give you a good grade. My lab grades weren't the best, and I still got an A. Exams are based on the textbook, not hard. Will recommend her for ENVI majors.",1
"He's a very decent teacher, but..
 When the class did well on a test, he made the next one harder to ""challenge"" us. Thanks man.
 And he applied baseball cards as an analogy for accounting to computer programmers. This caused some confusion and many blank stares.",1
"Awesome teacher. Very helpful, balance of material, and easy course. Sometimes he can be a little repetitive and repeat things or topics that we've already gone over, but they stick better this way. Young, knowledgeable and funny.",1
Dr amid bitar has taught me pathology for the past 4months and I have to say he's the best pathology teacher ever. He's indeed excellent and I hope to become like him some day. He's AMAZINGGGGGG,1
You have to teach yourself. No matter how many zoom recordings reviews & practice exams BE PREPARED TO TEACH YOURSELF. I regret taking this professor esp. online. Homework takes up majority of your time and has NOTHING TO DO WITH THE EXAMS & reviews HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE EXAMS! take her if it's your last option. You've been warned! Be wise!,0

"Dr. Mike is the best. He devotes so much time outside of class for his students. I honestly never had a professor that cared so much. He's also so funny without realizing it. This man deserves an award. The slides are useless (and he knows that). Just write down exactly what he puts on the board, do ALL of the practice exams, and you're set",1
Dr. Mark is definitely one of the most unique professors I have ever had. She is extremely passionate about her classes so take her seriously when she talks or you will not do well. The textbook helps for the quizzes but the material on the exams are difficult to find so study! Great professor but grades the group project pretty aggressively.,1
Jallen is mad chill and easy. Just do the assignments and you'll do well on exams. Grades leniently on group projects and is flexible with late work. Take him for sure!,1
"How to get an ""A"" in KNES 350 with Jo Zimmerman: 1)Show up to class EVERY DAY and take the clicker quiz.  2)Put at least some effort into the paper (everyone gets an ""A"" if you follow instructions).  3)Study the and memorize the highlighted slides before each test.  Yes the class is boring but it's an easy ""A"" if you put some effort into it.",1
I had Crawley for S&P.  The class is difficult due to the amount of reading and content but the concepts are interesting. I think Crawley made the class entertaining and he is funny which helped.  Quizzes and tests could be hard if you were not reading/studying the material.  I would recommend to get into study groups.,1
Awesome learning experience.,1
Music 152 is by far the easiest class to take if you need a fine arts requirement. All you need to do is show up for the tests and you'll be fine. All the tests answers are on quizlet too so don't worry about having to take notes.,1
Great professor for a upper division class. However horrible professor for a general education course.,0
"A great class and a great professor. Class was recorded and as long as you watched all the lectures and paid attention, assignments and tests were very easy. The mini quizzes were very easy. Lectures were very well done and interesting. Definitely an easy A if you attend/watch lectures. Highly recommend this class!",1
Tests are not that easy. Takes awhile to get back with you (text or email) but will respond.,0
"Professor Ladon has a lot of knowledge about what she teaches but she teaches the 121 class as if it is a 131 or higher level course. She is belittling when students ask questions and expects students to do numerous hours of studying, whether it be from the textbook or practice problems. She drops the lowest quiz and homework grade.",0
"Ostermeyer is strongly opinionated, or at least the subject matter contains strong opinions some people might disagree with. If youre willing to sit and listen to a different perspective for a fairly easy A, take this gen ed. Ostermeyer is engaging and keeps things interesting. Lots of small assignments that build up points.",1
"He can at times seem intimidating, but he's incredibly easy to talk to and is willing to help out his students. He also tends to give out extra credit to those that are actively engaged with campus events.",1
"Great professor, very funny! easy class for physiology. Quiz every week but he will review for it and tell you what you need to know for quiz, 1 easy paper 4-5 pages. Mid term and Final questions come from weekly quizes, take him!",1
Hauck is the best professor I have ever had. He prepares you very well for the exams and makes sure you know the material well. Would take again.,1
"Professor Crowley is the type of instructor that is able to break down the concepts of chemistry in  way that's easy to digest. If your someone who has trouble in chem, take her class! All the notes, tests, and expectations are clearly defined and she gives you plenty of information to succeed. Don't cram! Work hard and you'll be absolutely fine   ",1
"Really funny and witty.  Used cuss words every now and then which made us laugh.  Is really down to earth and easy to talk to.  I didn't use the book, just my notes, which there are a lot of, but everyone on the test comes from them.  Show up to class on time, he hates late people, he looses his train of thought.  Awesome professor!",1
"Most interesting and relaxed TRS class I have taken (the others put you to sleep). My only gripe is the level of busy work in this class, concept questions are due every class (they take 5 minutes to do). Majority of grade was unit papers - they are very broad and she cares more about how you interpret the concepts we talked about.",1
"There is a lot of work associated with this class, but it is all geared to help you prepare for a career and help you find a major for when you transfer to a 4 year institution. The textbook is frequently used. Dr. Laughlin is good at explaining things, and what is expected of you. She also has a great personality, and makes class itself fun.",1
His grading system is extremely frustrating.  He grades harshly with no feedback to give you room for improvement next time.  His grading system is ambiguous  and inconsistent.  The works studied are borderline X-Rated.  He specifically tells you not to use any outside research.  You must accept only his interpretation of the material.,0
"She's straighforward and smart.  Um, I don't think ""estrogenical"" is a word.",1
"He will doubtless stimulate you to engage and fuel more thought/ideas into your own work. He also inspires you to imagine yourself as an academic. Beyond this, he is incredibly helpful, intelligent --all the qualities that are really valuable.",1
"This prof made me absolutely hate this class. She and our TA miscommunicate on everything. Get ready for the most unorganized class of your life. If you want to be spoken to like a toddler, take this class. Gets mad at people for being on zoom and not in class. Like sorry we're in a pandemic and I don't want to get corona? Extremely insensitive.",0
"Nice woman, but somewhat disorganized and never returns graded work. I still have no idea what grade I got on 2 of the 5 papers I submitted during the course. We didn't get our first assignment returned until 10 weeks into a 16 week course. Isn't an overly strict grader, however entire grade is based on papers, with no tests or quizzes.",0
"Amazing professor! The way his class is structured makes it so that if you put in the effort, you will get an A. If you email him drafts of your essays, he will give great feedback. Everything on midterm and final are things discussed in class. His class made me love philosophy.",1
"This is a course where you have to interact with the Professor often, it is difficult because the Proffesor can sometimes be very rude/condescending. I did get a good mark for the course, however I found the Proff's attitude extremely unnecessary. There was a lot of interesting material to learn, but I would not retake the course with her.",0
She is a very good professor who focuses on the needs of her students.,1
Great Professor and nice teacher. Explains everything real clear. However first test was hard with four chapters but then the last two tests where better then the first. Extra credit avaiable. she loves what she teaches. three exams and one presentation,1
"This class was heavily exam based , but homework and discussion posts also account for your grade. Not an easy course, but exam reviews and PowerPoints given definitely helped me prepare for exams. Professor Melendez was very responsive and understanding during students issues with COVID-19 and distance learning. I would recommend.",1
"Mrs. Spencer is just the nicest teacher, she is patient and understanding",1
"Do not take qualitative methods with him. Your grade is based on three assignments which he does not give instructions on. I'm not even kidding, the final assignment was worth 45% of the final mark, and he gave out a 4 word outline - NO GUIDELINES. Between Turcotte and the TA, there was so much contradicting information given out.",0
"Professor Liggins is a really detailed professor. He will teach you how to successfully read and understand the plans. PAY ATTENTION AND SHOW UP. If you miss a day, you have to figure it out on your own or from someone else willing to help if they know how. Every single thing you learn in this class goes towards the AIC, so retain your notes.",1
"Posted a file that got corrupted and didn't repost till the day of the quiz on it, never answers emails outside of her 1:30 hour office hours. You will hate this class if you expect it to be easy or interesting. If i could give her a zero i would.",0
"Easiest class in the world, hardly have to show up. His lectures are boring but it's a guaranteed easy A. He does review sessions at the Rat before the midterm and pays for all your food :-)",1
"Dr. Yamazaki is a very knowledgeable teacher and knows the information she is teaching. Occasionally she has a hard time putting the information into understandable terminology instead of bio/physio jargon. She will help her students as much as she can, but you need to put in the work and asks questions if you have them",1
Hard grader and the test are really confusing and even with the supposed answer you can still get it wrong.,0
He doesn't really use the textbook for assignments but it is useful for grasping the material beyond lectures. Slides are posted on Blackboard and Large homework sets are done every other week. As long as you do the work and take notes you should do fine.,1
Took History of Country Music under Ms. Lupton. She is a great teacher and gives students MORE than enough time to submit late assignments. She knows her music and the online class is fairly easy. You have to read the chapters and answer the quiz questions (normally about 10). They are easy and you have to write lyrics to a couple of songs.,1
"She was very unclear with her instructions and her syllabus. The second day of class everyone lost 10 points for not doing an assignment that we were not told about or was stated clearly on the syllabus.
 She also plays favorites and picks on other students.",0
"Dr. Morris is the best! If you have any opportunity to take her class, do it. She is very understanding and kind, and is also excellent at explaining tougher concepts. She will go out of her way to help students if asked. The best, literally!",1
"Professor Looney has great knowledge in Astronomy, while he can explain them in a super easy way in an elementary class. He taught this class with great passion and great illustration. This class is definitely fun to take. If you are interested in further knowledge that this class won't cover, don't hesitate to ask him. Great teacher.",1
"Ning is confusing and skips around from one topic to the next without continuity. He doesn't explain concepts in physics, just teaches equations. You'll be lucky if he understands your questions or even acknowledges that you have a question. The class is an easy A though-all in-class worksheets and one out of three tests dropped.",0
"Shauna was amazing!! She wants the class to be involved, so she asks everyone questions related to the chapters. She gives great feedback, her assignments were fun to do and tests were straight forward if you study. Shauna is a joy to have, always very bubbly and makes learning fun!",1
Explains everything thoroughly and tells you exactly what he expects. He likes to tell funny jokes as well while explaining functions. Low amount of homework and relatively lenient.,1
I'm currently taking her course online and it's literally the worst online class I've ever taken. I can't keep up with the readings or the assignments. There's no explanation on most work and the modules are hard to understand. I wouldn't recommend anyone to EVER take this class.,0
Professor Tavss is hilarious and one of my favorite professors at Rutgers so far.  He is always willing to help students no matter what and is a great lecturer.  I didnt really go to lectures but he posts lots of examples and helpful practice problems online.  Do all those old problems and you're guaranteed an A.  I definitely recommend him!,1
She was a solid teacher who show a lot of interest in what she was teaching.,1
"She is a very nice woman and caring woman. Her class wasn't difficult, just show up and do the readings, take notes, participate. The only complaint I have is she doesn't input grades very fast, but she is busy with being a student and a mom. It's an easy going and interesting class. She is passionate about soc. Would take again.",1
"She's a good professor, but definitely don't take her if you're just looking for an easy A. She definitely makes you work for it. The tests aren't easy and the projects require a good amount of effort.",1
This professor promotes his own book and assumes that no one is good enough unless they read his book and go by his own completely impractical marketing dogma,0
"Isabelle seemed really nice and she was probably nervous as she told us it was her first time lecturing for such a large class but man..... she basically just read off the slide, all her own statements were just reworded what she had just said, and she was extremely confusing. There was stuff on the exam we NEVER covered. Goin to class not worth it",0
Cool guy!,1
"Dr. Wisner is cool so I took him twice. Very direct and responds to all emails. However, he often takes his time when it comes to grading assignments. ",1
"Excellent professor and interesting topic! All we did in class was watch videos. Yes, her notes were all over the place but the key points could easily be found on google and wikipedia. Try to attend the majority of classes and ask questions (yes, she did have favorites). Read everything on the syllabus and you will be fine.",1
"Dr. Meyer's lectures are heavily focused on his personal life, trauma that he has been through and his accomplishments. He has a confusing mix of talking about the terrible things that have happened in his life as well as the things he has accomplished and is proud of. Pretty annoying to listen to, though he is a nice guy.",0
"Professor Bailey was a great professor, her expectations are clear. she does gives alot of homeworks though but overall i think she is a fair grader! Work hard and you'll just do fine. she gave me multiple chances on my work and I appreciated it! I like the prompts and the essay! made me think critically and I learned alot Thakyou",1
I love this class. I cannot stress how much I love Prof Shaw. I had no interest in Women Studies before this class and now I love it. There's a weekly blog and the midterm is essays even though you don't write any before then. She has the class sit in a circle and everyone gets to know one another. It's wonderful.,1
"This class is a class that shouldn't be hard, but professor hill made it almost impossible. She was never willing to compromise or help you out if you were struggling in the class. Doesn't allow any extra credit and has no exceptions. Only way to get a good grade in this class is to study the book a ton and pay attention in lectures.",0
Best history prof. at the U. He seems easy at first but he will challenge to do better. Wish I could pull off the way he mixes his patterns on his clothes!!!!,1
"Everyone here seems to think this teacher is easy, but what they forget to mention is that the tests for each chapter are completely asinine. Asking the most unrelated questions and always using vague questions. If you can take this class with someone else. Or else take like 10 practice tests before the real test, they cover useless material.",1
Professor Endlich is amazing. You won't regret taking her class. She is accessible and very understanding. Has a few lectures and papers but she is not as strict as other professor. She makes class enjoyable and easy going.,1
great guy. solid. anytime,1
"Professor Leslie Looney is honestly amazing. I would call this my first positive experience with a science class!  In addition to being truly GOOD at teaching, he makes class interesting.  I literally lol almost every period.  LOONEY FOREVER!!!",1
"Great professor!! I took her class in spring 2019. She really knowledgable works hard to get students involved in learning process. She always offer assistance to struggling students to work on how to improve grades in her class. Very punctual in keeping her notes, grades, announcements etc. definitely recommended!!",1
"Maureen teaches an amazing class, and her ideas are inspiring. But she is genuinely senile. She has so many things she requires that are ridiculous, takes forever to give back assignments. And she marks hard on the first assignment and then easy on the rest, somehow making it look like her students have improved when they haven't.",0
No Comments,1
"While Professor Culter is pretty okay at exposing things in class, she is awful at giving good examples in her online video lectures. She expects you to know the material (which is fine) but doesnt explain how she gets certain numbers and where they came from. Half the class dropped out after the third chem lab. Do NOT have her as your professor!",0
he singles people out and talks mainly to the females in the class. do not take him,0
"Actually very good.  Gives a lot of real life examples. But be careful, the tests are hard though he gives some bonus questions. You have to understand the materials very well. If you work hard A should not very difficult, but of course, not super easy.",1
"I found her very unhelpful and unapproachable. The few times I interacted with her she was very unpleasant to deal with, and never fully answered my questions. She is clearly passionate about what she is teaching, but lacking the teaching skills. Would not recommend taking this class.",0
Attendance is mandatory. She used to be the director of ESL 1450. Its ironic for an English Second Language instructor to be a racist.,0
Professor Guzzone is very knowledgable about the Music Industry and all it entails. He definitely helped me become well versed in the world of Copyright and Media. I would recommend this class to anyone interested in working in the entertainment industry in anyway.,1
"So disorganized. Everything she knows about culture is just spilled all over the board and in lectures, and her powerpoints are so messy too. She gives you too many homework assignments that she probably doesn't even look at. This semester, she also wanted us to go to 2 events outside of class for credit, which were pointless.",0
"Dr Sheridan is a caring, thoughtful professor. He teaches 330 thematically and it is a really intersting approach. The books are good and well-balanced. Most of all, he is a wonderful mentor and passionate about history and helping students.",1
"Some material is difficult but he doesn't teach things that he doesn't think you need to learn. I forgot to do a written homework and he let me turn it in by the end of the day for what he said was partial credit, however I got a 90% on it so I think he just gave me a break. His tests usually have a bonus question.",1
Awesome course. Did not need adderall.,1
"I love having Alisha. She always is willing to work with you and walk through steps that are confusing. Things can seem to be a lot in this class, but they really aren't that bad. When you have Alisha she always will make sure you succeed. Highly recommend!",1
"I recommend that you sign up with him with any class that you can, he really cares about how well his student are doing and makes his lectures really interesting to listen to. He gives quizzes, Hw, and exams just like any other class but he switches it up for the hw and quizzes so it rotates between every other week,he gives plenty of time 4 both.",1
"A great professor to take for this course. He lays out everything you need to do to prepare for the exams. Does a great job presenting powerpoint notes. HW can be tricky, but he's always more than willing to explain in detail if you ask for help. Exams are right out of the HW and notes. If you study those, you'll do great.",1
"intense teacher, she is very smart and makes class interesting.  she's helpful, she gives guides for how to go about difficult reading. the class is hard, prepare to do a lot of work, make sure to prepare for class, she likes it when students speak up.",1
Great teacher!,1
Fantastic professor! I would take a class with him again any time. Thoughtful feedback and interesting class discussions.,1
"Soo much work! An excessive amount really, almost a hundred questions per chapter and you do two a week. Always includes a post with the work and she is an extremely hard grader. The work itself isn't too bad but it's very time consuming and very pointless.",0
I thought she was great. If you need help with the structure of your paper she will definitely help one on one  but during class doesn't explain it well or at all. She is very passionate about her subject which is why I liked her so much. Very easygoing personality makes you feel comfortable with the material.,1
"This was the best online class ever. She encourages you to use the book and notes as all the quizzes, exams and final is open book. She's very laid back and gives good feedback on discussions. The deadlines are very clear and organized. Even during a pandemic, she was so kind and understanding!",1
"Melissa is the saint of all saints, highly recommend taking her class if at all possible.",1
Very helpful and a very nice person. She knows what she is talking about and really wants to help her students. I would absolutely take her for this class if you can!!!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!,1
"Overall he is helpful and wants you to succeed. However,he is a very hard grader. If your not a good writer, and or don't like to write do not take his class. ALL you do is write and the  assignments are sometimes unclear.",1
"Dr. Harvey knows how to teach. She is patient and helps students whenever she can. Study her practice exams, they'll be helpful for the exams (4 exams including final). she drops the lowest grade if you do well on the final. Don't miss her lectures if you want to learn.",1
"Professor Davis is one of the best professors I have had at the University of Delaware. He is straightfoward with his notes and his examples reflect practice problems. Group projects are challenging, but applicable. Prof. Davis has a patented dry sense of humor, but you end up laughing anyways.",1
She is very professional and knows her stuff. If you keep her involved with your issues she is always there to help you. If you ignore this that is the student fault. A phone conference clears a lot of issues up and with her busy schedule she always makes time.,1
"Took this online. Recommend it to everyone. All blackboard assignments are based on opinion. She gives review sheets prior to test stating exactly what to study, and this is always true to her word. As long as you do every assignment on time (there are 9 very short ones this semester) and do review sheets, easy to do well.",1
Maria is a wonderful professor. She has a passion for the subject that not a lot of professors portray to their students. She has actually been to a lot of the places she speaks about in her lectures like the Guggenheim museum among many other places. Having her bring her passion was a breath of refreshing mountain air. Russian candy included.,1
Listens and adapts to students' concerns. Knows his stuff and cares about students' knowledge.,1
"I loved professor Knox. He had interesting lectures. His TA (Keely) was horrible i could not stand her. if you showed up a second late, were on your phone, or talk during lecture she will take 10 points off your attendance grade. I am not a soci major but this class was obtainable to my life so i found it interesting.",1
Brown a really nice guy and he does a lot better at teaching Orgo 2 then 1. If you read the book before class you'll really understand his lectures. A 60 is a C in his class and he curves more then professor i've ever known (i've had 18pt curves before). He's an okay teacher and you can definitely do well if you try really hard.,1
"He did provide a lot of reading material, some so valuable that I will keep for lifetime reference. Though he doesn't say it directly, I found we were not expected to thoroughly know every single article. Rather, skim to find snippets or entire articles that resonate with you and focus there. Assignments open in advance, good for busy ppl.",1
"You really do need to keep up with the readings, the quizzes are short. Gives a lot of extra credit opportunity. Great man, very funny. I totally recommend taking his classes.",1
Super clear lectures. Low difficulty but you can definitely learn things! Took his differential equations at Scripps College this semester. Really liked it!,1
"This was the third course I chose to take with Dr. Masud. He is the best teacher I have come across at postsecondary level. He does not only teach Ethics but practices it as well,",1
She is really nice and always willing to help!,1
He is absolutely horrible. I have learned nothing from this professor. He sits in class every day and just reads off the power points and plays YouTube videos of people teaching the concepts. The only reason I go to class is to sign the attendance sheet. He does all of the online quizzes in class. That's the only good thing about him.,0
Expects perfection,0
"Prof. Infante is a wonderful professor, very engaging and fun to listen to.  He genuinely cares about his students and wants them to succeed.  Awesome teacher!",1
"Mrs Brown is a really great and nice teacher, and she gives a lot of extra credit. The lecture in her class some kind of bored but lab part was fun. Otherwise, If you not understand, she will help you.",1
"I'm a math major and for me, this class was hard yet not impossible. There's a lot of hw and quizzes every week. My advice to you is that you should watch videos for every topic you don't understand, do examples from each section and then do the exercises&hw. That is what I did and I did well in this class. It takes a lot of time but it's worth it.",1
"Honestly, this class was one of the most enjoyable, easy classes I have taken. I am so glad I found this ""Social Media"" class. It only lasts half a semester and def an easy  A if you do the work. Don't get lazy as it's not much work! Easiest A if you do the work. Also, very nice person in general.  I would take him again if I could!",1
I emailed him and asked him multiple times to meet with me throughout the semester - got very few responses the entire time. AKA hard to get ahold of. If we were in class it would probably be much better. Fill out the study guides as much as possible and you will pass.,1
"After speaking with other students in other 101 sections, it became clear that I hit the jackpot by being placed into Krutz's section. Wish I could take him for more classes.",1
"Lectures are very thorough? This guy legit never writes a SINGLE LINE OF CODE in his class, and he has no DEGREE according to KPU faculty, how could you take him? There's a reason why only 8 people show up at his ONLINE lecture!",0
His tests are online and okay. Take notes and read the articles. His lectures are extrememly boring but he takes attendance so you have to go.,1
He is an awesome teacher. He is really easy too. He always tells you exactly what he will be testing you on. The logic class was really interesting and fun. I wish I could take it again. Easy A,1
"One of the best class experiences I've had. Prof. Nielsen is very chill but upbeat and seems to really enjoy being with students. Classes felt relaxed but she knows what she's talking about and gives easy to understand, matter of fact instruction. Course load is pretty moderate but you'll definitely know Photoshop when you get out.",1
"This is one of those professors that says there's a ""method to their madness"" because they know they're too disorganized to teach properly",0
He's literally the best professor I've had. Lectures are super informative and going to class is a must because he has a very specific teaching style. You definitely have to work for your grade but he really wants to see people succeed and has a lot of practice problems and review you can do before your exams.,1
"If you like being yelled at and lectured like a child then take him. Self torture is the best kind of pain, but he will add to it. If you don't do your work then he will straight up ask you ""why are you event here""? He will kick you out of class, ask you to leave, and dismiss you. He will tell you ""get out of my face"".  extremely rude.",1
Very intelligent professor with a lot of experience.,1
"He is a good professor. He gives you study guides that if you do them, they are word for word like his exams. Any word he says is relevant to these study guides so you need to pay attention.  He does curves. Enough said with that.",1
He isn't the most communicative instructor. Had to ask for the assignment schedule and it isn't laid out well online. Not the most responsive to emails.,0
"This class is an easy A. The only downside is that you likely won't learn anything unless you REALLY try to. Test, homework and even the final was online. Class was pretty much optional and even you went, you won't be able to hear him speak (he whispers). He did give a pop quiz during recitation once though.",1
"I wish I didn't take the advice from people leaving reviews here. I do not care how good you think you are at math this guy was a rude awakening for me. It wasn't until I started skipping class and teaching it to myself did I improve. Marks you down for doing math problems ""in a way that is confusing"" to him even if you get the right answer. Run.",0
Avoid at all costs...,0
"KNOWS HIS STUFF! Very smart prof. Able to answer anything you would want to know about History. Class is just lectures and note taking, unfortunatly boring-especially at 8:00am.",1
"Definetely not a bad teacher. She is always available if you need help. There is a lot of reading material required for the class. For each book groups are chosen to spend an hour long class discussing it in great depth. Requires a decent amount of writing and essay assignments. All in all, she is a really nice teacher.",1
Dr. Blankenship is such a great ENG 111 professor. She is very caring and her grading is very easy. All you have to do is show up to class and do the work she assigns and you will pass. If I ever have to take ENG 112 I will pick her for it.,1
"Neva is one of the best teachers I've had so far. Her attention to detail and knowledge of great academic writing made her an endless amount of knowledge. My writing and active reading improved immensely over the course of the quarter. She does have high expectations, and yes it's a challenging class. But worth it!",1
"Norris was so distant from his students. He didn't even know the SI's name for this course. Exams were curve balls. Whole grade for the semester was based on TWO EXAMS AND THE FINAL - and some points for the partnered lab section. He made studyguides, but refused to post them or the powerpoints to CC. Wouldn't take him again.",0
He is a terrible teacher. Please don't take him. I had to drop. I don't feel like he gave me the chance to really appreciate the subject and topic. His exams have only 3 questions and are nothing like the 40 questions homework he gives you. He CANT TEACH! He will mess up your GPA.,0
"Honestly one of the worst profs Ive had. Extremely boring and using most of class time for unecessary discussion time between students. Feels like there isnt enough criteria for her to teach, so she needs to fill the time through wasting it. Beware of pop quizzes. She is also very very hard to understand, regardless of how slow she talks. Quiet.",0
"Mrs. Hubbard is kind, professional, and involved.  Approachable, very interested in maternity, very knowledgeable. You can go to her anytime for help and she is open to ideas for making the class better.  She will be your best support!  The only drawback is perhaps the number of projects for class...a little too much ""busy work"".",1
"didn't go to a single lecture, didn't do a single lab more than an hour before it was due, and didn't learn a thing from the class... yet still got an A+!",1
"As other reviews state, he's a good dude. He knows lectures suck so he gets the class involved (especially at 7am). Tests are super easy because he lets you use notes, he doesn't believe classes should just be ""learn the material and spit it back"". Highly recommended, will be taking him again next semester. Easy A as long as you do the work.",1
"Kate is one of the greatest professors I've ever had, she is an inspiration in theatre and has definitely inspired me a lot when I had her last year. Take her class, you won't regret it!",1
"Not going to lie, I couldn't stand her at first. Trust me, give it time and you will appreciate her. She is intimidating at first, but you will learn SO much from her that will be helpful as a teacher. She really just wants her students to reach their full potential. I have learned more in her class than any other class I've taken at ECSU.",1
Has no grading criteria at all so there is really no way to know what grade youre going To get on an assignment. Pop quizzes are given randomly and marked hard. Assignments are all very similar. PowerPoints are full of grammatical errors,0
"SO NICE! Super easy class and Professor Summers truly cares about each of his students, he is very knowledgeable and great at providing opportunities to learn from other nurses who have experience in different fields. He has such a positive attitude and is a great professor!",1
"I don't see why people don't like Professor Guetter. His stats course is a breeze -- he only really teaches how to do the work in RStudio :/. His jokes are punny and he can be self-deprecating is a good way. Overall a good person, ok lecturer. Just be ready to pay attention...",1
"Wonderful professor. Intermediate II is a tough class, but he does a great job of breaking down the material in a way that is easier to understand. His tests are really fair and he gives partial credit. High recommend!",1
"Taking a class (505 or 524) with Rachael is one of the most beneficial things you can do if you're going into this field. Not only do her classes get you great real world experience, but she will help you outside of class whether it's applying to jobs, internships, grad schools, networking or literally anything else you need help with!",1
Terrible at explaining the material. You come to class and all he does is work through examples. If you ask a question -- be prepared to look like an idiot. His tests are more difficult and somewhat different than what's on the homework he assigns.,0
"I hated this class with a passion. He is a cool person but I don't think he is teacher material, or maybe because he hasn't found his groove yet since he was a new teacher. The lectures dragged on, he would get off topic easily and we wouldn't cover all of the material before the tests. Easy A/B but be ready to be miserable.",0
"Whoever wrote those last comments are completely wrong. Mr. Goldiner is by far my favorite teacher at Cuesta. No homework, only 3 tests and 2 essays in the whole semester. He tells you EXACTLY what will be on the test, and it is. No surprises with this teacher he is crystal clear, not to mention really funny. Very intelligent and I learned a lot.",1
"I liked Professor LaMothe as a person, but not really as a teacher. This was her first time teaching and I felt like the class was everywhere. She would lecture for two hours and 30 minutes straight and only leave like 20-30 minutes to do a group project that requires way more time than that. Also her TA grades papers and it's based on her opinion.",0
"Would not take with him he is always off topic, we were 4 chapters behind where we should have been give easy questions for assignments and super hard ones for test. Doesn't explain things well. Would not take again with him",0
"This professor is very passionate about geography. He keeps things upbeat to the best of his ability. He has weekly reading quizzes that aren't easy, but they're only worth ten points each. If you take this class with a friend, it's helpful",1
"Horrible class, I could write a monologue about how the homework was excessive or how the lectures were unclear or maybe about his inability to work with me, but I'll save you the trouble of reading all of that, and of taking this class.",0
First day of class: had Digable Planets playing on the stereo - need I say more?  Fun class!  Fun professor.  Take it if you're lucky enough to get into the class.,1
"NOT an easy A kind of teacher. He will make u work 4 it! I got an A (thanks to xtra credit for perfect attendance). He gets frustrated if u question him too much or argue with him. My advice? GO TO TUTORING, stay quiet in clas (unless u have right answr) , good attendance  xtra credit, DO THE HW wa tutor!! He doesnt grade it, but it will help u! ",0
"Professor Ikegwuonu is a very nice woman. Often times, she goes off on irrelevant spiels and forgets what she's lecturing about. The book is trivial as long as you take good lecture notes. I gave her a 4 for difficulty because the tests sometimes do not follow the lectures making them hard. There''s one 10-page research paper, worth 35%.",1
"She's a nice and kind woman, but she's very stubborn and not really willing to see other views. If you write exactly what she wants you to (meaning, agreeing with her opinion) you'll do pretty well, but if you try to challenge any of her views, expect to get hit hard. Very unclear grading criterion.",0
"Rick is a super nice guy, he worked for the Fed for many years, so he has a lot of knowledge when it comes to financial institutions.",1
Lenient about due dates. Very helpful if you take the time to ask questions. She’s a great professor and enthusiastic about what she teaches. Tests are difficult.,1
"This woman, has been the worst of my experience so far. Her tests are weighted, and are either three questions long, or 8 pages long. Her Conduct class is absolutely terrible.I had a passion for political science before taking her class and it is no longer existent. She doesn't care about her students and she gets an A++ on being a terrible advisor",0
"Toms a character, but knowledgeable about what he teaches.",1
The class is completely online. I liked her teaching style and simple/organized structure of the course. The quizzes are 10 question each and you get two tries. The highest grade counts. She is accessible by email or phone should you need it. She also gives good feedback and is fair with the grading. She grades with a rubric. A great experience.,1
"This is a difficult class, it is a language class after all. He makes everything seem more entertaining and he truly cares for each student that he has. It you want to take French i would definitely recommend him!",1
She's a nice lady but at time is very bossy and wants things to get done ver her she really cares about her students and especially puente becareful though she would try to convince you to take a bunch of units for one semester,1
"I had already taken Chem before and I skipped Chem151 to take this class. His lectures are EXTREMELY dull, and I spent most of the time taking my own notes on the exact lecture he was lecturing on for 3.5 hours. Exams were easy for me, but any questions I had were not answered well, and it seemed like he never understood how to answer a simple one.",1
Absolutely awful. Not helpful to students who approach and has the most terrible marking scheme. Avoid her class.,0
"Not good in teaching. Book won't help much, you will have study from the lecture. If you get average or above average in the exams you will be fine. This guy doesn't care about students. but he curves at the end.",0
Good professor overall. I never liked math and only took the class for gen-ed requirement but the material she goes over is interesting and I did learn some useful stuff from the course. Class went fully online mid semester but she did good job in making things easily accessible. Exam problems are similar to the examples she goes over in class,1
"Good teacher, gives a lot of extra credit on test. Only thing the writing assignments are long",1
Jeff Allen is the grand master of PPS! Take him.,1
"Higham was a very good professor. The homework load is relatively heavy, but it's within reason. His approach was very professional. He didn't act like a ""friend"", but he was very approachable. I personally appreciate that.",1
"the only class that i never wanted to miss. Great prof.,very helpful, nice, smart, n hot !",1
Dr. McDonald boils down complex stats to simpler terms. He is very good at explaining statistical tests and their usage in familiar and easy-to-follow language. You will also get some lessons on ethics and conducting research right way. Sometimes time seems to go by really slow during lectures.,1
"I would not take this class again. With this class, it would be impossible for me to even pass. Lecture you had to practically teach to yourself using the powerpoints slides which briefly described the concepts. The practice problem videos were unclear and it did not seem that she was interested in the subject. For lab she was unhelpful and unclear",0
"Professor Bronie is a great teacher that truly cares about her students' success. She's a good choice if you're just starting out, or have struggled with math in the past. There's a lot of homework and the tests are relatively easy. The one negative thing I can say is that she's hard of hearing, so you have to repeat yourself sometimes.",1
"Marek is a very courteous and professional individual but he has many flaws in regards to his job as a professor. First of all, he does not tell you what he expect. No rubrics or guidelines are given for projects, so you have to do your best and accept the bad grade that comes with it. He also is very inconsistent with his marking. ",0
"Very understanding during the pandemic. Homework due once a week but towards the end, it was harder concepts but it was perfect and aligned with the tests super well. It's hard to keep up with lectures sometimes so make sure you are prepared. This class taught me so much and he is very generous with extra credit. Overall a solid and humble prof.",1
"Dr. Maher is a good professor. His powerpoints come directly for the textbook, and he posts them to blackboard so you really don't need to go to class but I would recommend going because he gives you participation quizzes which you don't even have to get the right answer to get the points. Lectures are boring, but the tests aren't hard, just study.",1
It was fun. Now I can speak Russian. The trip to NY was amazing!,1
Professor Hart REALLY knows her stuff. A good professor & you WILL learn a lot. Expect a lot of homework every single week. The assignments can get quite repetitive but there is a reason why she chooses to do it this way. Tedious at times. You cannot pass this class without the textbook. Participation and attendance is very much mandatory.,1
"The homework and quizzes are online and he gives you a lot of time to complete them. You need to buy the book because it connected with the homeowork. He is really sweet and is fast to respond to emails. This course is good if you have to fulfill a requirement, not so much if accounting is your major.",1
"Prof. Conta is absolutely the best, informative, entertaining, caring teacher in the administrative dept at LACC. He is a true gem. He is so human, humble, and yet, so spectacular....one of a kind.",1
He is hard at first but if you study you will pass. He gives curves on exams which helps a lot. Very fair if he sees that you are trying he will work with you. I would take his class again.,1
"I took the hybrid class.  He kept everything up to date on D2L and sent e-mail reminders when an assignment was due.  The assignments are easy to get full credit on.  The tests are matching and multiple choice, but he grades on a curve.  Be sure to study the book and the notes for the tests.",1
He is just the best teacher ever,1
"not the best communicator, not particularly understanding, either. VERY inconsistent with grading and assignments / tests. comes off as rude, but she is a relatively nice person.",1
"Exams have a lot of ""trick questions"" for no reason. It is also a little troubling that this man can barely form coherent sentences/spell basic words correctly is critiquing writing. In my opinion it is ridiculous to pay thousands for an online class when it seems that your level of education is higher than the professor. Gross",0
Be prepared to teach yourself everything or get a tutor. When you ask to get help on a question he will not help you and look at you like you should know everything. He doesn't give you credit for any homework if you miss the class period they checked it in no matter the circumstances.,0
"Lovely human being and teacher. She is a teacher and a friend, which is rare  Always there for you and inspires you to do your best. This was my first ASL class and now I am a deaf studies major. Hope to have her in level 3",1
the best of the chem profs,1
"I loved having Patti as a prof. She was able to keep me fairly interested in what was going on, and when though I didn't read most of the material, I was still able to understand what the books were about! I would love to take a class with her again!",1
"Falk is a nice man. I appreciate his sincerity in his grading curves. That being said, the book for this class is disorganized, without clear solutions. His tests average about 30-40% for the whole class, and his work seems disorganized and often messy. A very nice professor, but one whose class is often unneccesarily difficult and confusing.",0
"Professor Dent is awesome! She completely explains assignments with a detailed, written explanation that she goes over in class & online. 6 pop quizzes, but SOMETIMES hints before. First part of the class is hard concepts. Huge research paper but she breaks it up and gives great help in office hours. Really funny and down to earth, would take again",1
"Bring your ""PAF"" count; bring your ""Blessure narcissique"" count; bring your pillow",0
"He explains everything in a way students can understand, but requires class participation also. The written assignments (there were 10 of them) are extremely difficult.  It is totally possible to receive an A in the class, but you're going to have to work hard for it. I learned so much in his class and would take him again in a heartbeat.",1
"DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID!! I thought this course might be an easy elective option, but no. The lectures are recorded but they are literally just close up videos of her face, NO powerpoint or anything. The syllabus is extremely misleading and the evaluation criteria is very unclear. Plus, very unorganized. Dropping it ASAP.",0
AC 470 is required for my major and I was dreading it. Professor Dugas made it painless and as good as auditing can probably be. Her lectures are entertaining especially for a night bomb. She really cares if her students do well and made sure we understood material before we moved on. The tests are standard across classes and I felt really prepared,1
"Such a boring Professor. He is a nice guy, yet he is VERY monotoned. Also when he is going over the PowerPoints, he doesn't elaborate at all. I could not tell you a single that that we are talking about in this class. Tests and homework are easy though and the book is expensive.",0
He is amazing,1
One of my favorite professors in my online college experience. He encouraged out of the box ways of thinking while providing plenty of information to grasp what he expected of you. A fair grader that I would recommend taking. If he offered more classes I needed I would be taking him again.,1
"I had to take her online because of COVID-19. I thoroughly enjoy writing but her class made want to despise the entire subject. She seriously takes forever to grade assignments and marks points down for small mistakes. I feel like the experience would be different in a face-to-face class, but overall do not recommend.",0
"WORST TEACHER I have ever had in my life. She went on about how we should already know stuff instead of actually helping us, and the worst part is that she made us do the Kanji on our own time which is terrible because thats my weakest area. DO NOT TAKE HER u will regret it",0
She's an awesome teacher! Has a great sense of humor and her teaching is crystal. If you have a problem she helps you out. She lets you know what to study for the tests. Not a hard teacher at all!,1
This dude is awsome.,1
She is easily the best math teacher I've had. She keeps her class fun and interesting.,1
"Absolutely the best professor. Dr Cleveland's passion for marketing is infectious, and he sprinkles fun anecdotes from his life experiences into the material to help explain difficult concepts. His exams are difficult, as he requires you to recount both textbook & lecture material quicker than a Catholic reciting a Hail Mary. Work hard  good grade",1
his class was all over the place. We had a lot of different books and we would jump all over the material. He would go off on tangents a lot and it felt like what he was saying didn't align with what we were reading. His essay assignments were confusing and he took forever to grade. He's very stuck in his ways and i wouldn't take him again.,0
"Shes the best anthropology professor at WKU. Incredibly interesting, witty, and hilarious. Shes a bit scatterbrained but if you pay attention, youll be fine. Tests are usually a few vocab words, followed by a few short answer, followed by a choice of essay. Theres usually two or three class discussions, too.",1
"I'm sure she's great for upper level classes because I can tell she's caring & intelligent. However, this was so much work for a 100 level class. & I don't think she planned her lessons. I was stuck listening to directionless ramblings twice a week. Take someone else for ENG 104, especially if you've waited until senior year to take it (like me).",0
"Maher is a great guy and has a funny sense of humor. The first exam was very difficult only because I had no clue how his tests were. I suggest going over the slides, studying the animal families, and reading the book for more specifics. PAY ATTENTION to the things he mentions multiple times and even the side stories bc they are usually on the test",1
"Ochem is a hard subject to start with, and Dr. Kennedy really tries to help anyway he can. There is a lot of extra credit though, and the option to do homework for more points. Tests are hard, though.",1
"This is by far the hardest Statistics class to understand just because of the layout of the class. Exams are nothing like the HW problems in the book along with Wiley Plus. He drops an exam out of 3 still not helpful. The notations from his lectures to the books are different, which makes it harder to understand.",0
"Professor Hooper Mark has been my strength, though I know quite right that I am going to learn a lot from him when I first met him but never think that it will be as much as I did. In fact, Hooper your mode of teaching is really superb and clarity of words as the best teaching method which I believe will continue linger in all our heart.",1
"Professor Alemayhu is fair, but sometimes you mostly have to ask him to explain assignments clearly. He does care and wants everyone to pass his class, just do the lab exercises and you will do well.",1
"HW due on test day; tests are multiple choice YAY!, 4 ques. pop quiz for every chapter, very low stress and he is very understanding to your needs. He is willing to help you! If you put in the effort you cannot fail, he wants you to pass! This was my 2nd semester with him for these reasons! I could not have passed without him",1
No Comments,1
"Listen, I'm not one to dislike many professors, but I honestly really dislike her. If you can avoid Yana Sandlers, please do at any and every cost. Not only did her lectures not make sense, if you asked her a question, she just reworded your question into an ""answer"". She does not know what she's doing.",0
"Before having him, chemistry was a huge source of anxiety for me. Now, for the first time, I'm learning & enjoying chemistry. Grateful to have such an engaging professor. He makes a difficult subject fun & has a molecule of the day to connect what we are learning to everyday life. Tips: do practice problems, go to GSS, ask questions, and take MS!",1
This class was by far the most BORING class I have ever taken. It was seriously painful. She is ALL lecture and power points. She was really nice and her tests were super easy but the class was so boring. If your looking for an easy A this class is great but so boring.,1
"Great humor. Always gives you honest advice if you need it. She's a motivating person and works hard with her students as opposed to just watching them. Honestly, I love her.",1
He was an amazing teacher that spoke to the class on a more informal level and drew many analogies that help me and my classmates learn complex material by relating it to concepts that we already understand.,1
"Mrs. Khan is a cool teacher, everything on the tests are in the lectures and class activities.  Do all the homework which are easy points. There are only two test and haft the finale is the midterm, which she will correct and go over the questions  if you ask. You do have to write out answers, but it easy. The speeches are easy to.",1
"Loved his Killer Skies class! He's very funny and allows you to bring in a sheet of notes for each test and even the final! Theres no textbook, but you have to use his ppt slides alot for the HW and cheat sheets. The HW is quite hard tho, even with the ppt slides given to you. But you get unlimited number of tries, and the highest score is taken",1
Horrible professor. Dont take him. Very disrespectful and rude to students for no reason. Grades too hard and assigns difficult work.,0
"I cannot speak for in person learning, but IF DISTANCE LEARNING EVER HAPPENS AGAIN, DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR'S CLASS! Maybe he's more engaging in person, but over the computer- NO HELP AT ALL! ZERO class participation, just reads off his powerpoint. Doesn't explain content. But, he did provide all the materials to BB for you to teach yourself.",0
Richard Allen is not a super easy A at all but his tests are very straight forward. I went to class 0 times but watched the lectures and never struggled on an exam,1
"If you care about just passing this course, try to get a hold of old exams and keep re-doing them over and over again. If you actually want to learn the content, the lectures are very heavy and he moves very fast. So try to spend 1 hr everyday studying the lectures and understanding everything. The homework is very difficult, so most people cheat",0
"I wish I knew of this site before taking this teacher.  She is often late for class,  late returning assignments, totally off schedule, lecture has very little to do with English or readings.  Not very personable. Loses your assignments, extremely disorganized. i would not recommend her.",0
"very fun class! i enjoyed it! all you do is pay attention, take notes as you watch movies and you will pass guaranteed. Has 4 essays, presentation, 1 midterm, final. No hw! i recommend this class for anyone who enjoys films and need an easy A. Very nice prof and knows a lot about the subject. I actually learned a lot in this class.",1
"BY FAR my worst learning experience at Humber College to date. This instructor was an absolute embarrassment to Humber's reputation, and should be removed from the faculty immediately. Only showed up on time for 2 out of 15 classes. When he did arrive he was arrogant and demeaning. He made me feel dumb for asking questions. Unprofessional bully.",0
"Ill be honest, yeah he is not the best at teaching BUT outside of class he really wants you to do well and acc would help you, so talk to him, he is so kind and understanding and mans acc funny! I didn't expect to do well, but he helped me get the grade I needed!",1
"TAKE THIS PROFESSOR AT YOUR OWN RISK! Completely unhelpful, unwilling to correct mistakes, straight lecture, no actual problems done until you do your homework. Extremely picky grades while creating ridiculously vague problems on test.",0
"shes so amazing! she seems cold but she can be so helpful. shes a brilliant artist and knows A LOT. She will gear you in the right direction, just give her a chance.",1
"Dave Dusseau is a truly amazing professor, at least for the class I had (BA 101). I took this class at 8 am and he made it less worse by having interesting and entertaining lectures. The class is not difficult. If you put in the work for mikesbikes and the textbook, it's an easy A.",1
"She's a funny and kind professor. She curves exams, gives extra credit, very helpful when asking questions. This class is alot of work and studying time but it's doable if you have other heavy load classes. Its all about time management. I recommend a week before the exam to study. She's picky and detailed but overall, she's great w Anatomy!",1
"Dr. Hill is not a very good professor. She gives you a test and then tells you that it's the ""scantron people's"" fault that the tests don't get put into BB until a week and a half after. Do get the book because the practice problems at the end of the chapter are on the tests, as well as the questions from the quizzes. YOU HAVE TO STUDY.",0
"Tests are not made by him. So his tests do not mesh with his teaching style. I am a son of a math teacher, and even his math oriented questions were confusing because he does not clearly go over the math part of the course. Personally, I wish there was more math so I could have had a different grasp of the information. Physics can get wordy!",0
"Without a doubt one of the worst teachers I have ever had, in one of the worst classes I have ever taken.  She has an extreamly annoying voice, and can't control the volume of it.  She says um at the beginning of almost EVERY sentance.  The worst 2 hours you will ever have to sit through!",0
"Chris was an awesome professor! I took him for both World Geo & International Relations and I can honestly say I will never have a teacher that can compare to that. He is extremely passionate about what he teaches & he will talk to you for hours, answering any questions you may have. It's not always easy but if he sees you're trying, you will pass.",1
"Seems like she is scared to be up in front of the class teaching, sometimes stutters or doesnt know when you ask her a question.  Overall pretty boring and irrelevant class.",0
"Mr. Huff is AWESOME. He doesn't just teach the material, he explains why/how the formulas work and it makes math practical. I actually look forward to learning math!",1
"Charlotte is a great professor. She is extremely willing to help and wants you to succeed. Super available for office hours and is lenient based on the circumstances of online learning. Her classes are very vibrant, you have to participate and pay attention, so you really learn. I recommend taking French with her!",1
Florencia is one of the nicest teachers you will ever have.  She makes the class interesting and engaging.  Even if you are not very good at spanish she will help you learn.  Very fair grader.,1
Not very good ,0
"Professor Sheridan is a great professor, class is lecture heavy; however he gives detailed study guides ! Also three exams including final, 3 novels which youre quizzed on, and a paper on one of them. He lets u use notes for the exams. Overall great professor very hilarious!",1
"Professor Andrew's class was not difficult. If you want to do well in your essays READING is a must, so you can add a lot of detail in your essays. He gives journals everyday that you get credit for as long as you do them. Took him early in the AM and don't regret it because he really gets everyone to engage in the discussions.",1
"Overall a kind professor. Every week there is a reading response due for the readings assigned for the week, and for the film watched that week. Honestly learned a lot from this class. She won't give you an easy A on responses. You need to answer the prompts with the specific answer she's looking for. No midterm and a paper as the final.",1
"This man is a gem. Biochemistry is not easy, but if you record/relisten to lectures, take notes, and do his practice questions, you should do well! So kind, so approachable and so passionate. 10/10- the best professor I've had in a while",1
"She knows what she is talking about in chemistry, but honestly she is the type of teacher that assumes you get it really fast. She is super nice but a little unorganized. If you go to her after class she will definitely explain it to you which works better for me since I feel like throughout lectures she would rush.",0
"Mrs. Elfring was my best teacher at ECC so far! She is so funny and uses a lot of TED talks in her lessons. The papers are to be expected as per an honors english class, but the feedback given makes them easy to revise.",1
"Gives you access to his Power Point  presentations for his lectures. During each lecture, he will tell you what study focus on for the tests.",1
"Professor Ross is honestly legendary. Sends you his own notes to break down the dense material. He's just out there to teach, he makes sure you learn this amazingly complex material. A true philosopher.   ",1
"Pay attention to clicker q's as about half of the test q's come from them. Must attend class b/c he says info that will be on the exams. Focus on the purple phrases as they make up the exams (still good to know the other stuff). Don't ask him what to study b/c he wants you to enjoy the class. Drops the lowest test grade, so final may be optional.",1
"So Luttrell is a nice old man. He has become the butt of most of our jokes though. He would be great teaching toxicology I'm sure, but O Chem is definitely not his strong suit. However, he is the only O Chem professor at OC. Just READ the book, get labs and homework done (easy grades), and good luck learning.",0
hesss amazing!!!! take him,1
"Great guy! Makes class interesting, tests are usually pretty easy and he is funny.",1
"Brooke is great! I took her for Trig, which i was nervous for. She always wanted to make sure we understood what she was teaching. Her lectures were never boring. Her class is weighted heavily on your exams, so make sure to study. Overall, she is a really understanding and fun teacher to take.",1
You'd be a fool no to sign up for this class immmediately! She is very understanding of situations. Just do the few simple essays that she clearly explains and study for the few quizzes that she gives a study guide for and clearly explains and you should get an A. Highly recommended!!,1
"I think he's really sweet and caring, he tries to teach you as much as possible but really you could sleep in his class. He's totally fine but i just didn't learn anything in his class and passed regardless. I love him though and i wouldn't mind taking him again, 2 critiques & 1 experimental report & 1 take home final. He's nice though! you'll pass",1
"If you want a teacher who is passionate about her students and gives you reading material that is actually interesting- take Professor Pearson. She's pretty clear about what she's looking for and holds a lot of writing workshops to help you with your papers, she doesn't like to give bad grades so it's very easy for you to do well in this class.",1
"WONDERFUL PROFESSOR.  VERY CLEAR. MAKES YOU THINK AND WRITE LUCIDLY.  TAKE HIM.  IF YOU WORK WITH HIM, YOU CAN GET AN A",1
Great teacher. I took this class in the summer and still learned a ton.,1
"Terrifying and bizarre experience. ""Accidentally"" marked my answers wrong throughout the semester and then continuously denied it, repeatedly pretending like they had no idea what I was talking about. One of my exam grades went from a B to an A because of these erroneous deductions. Very, very scary.",0
"5 thumbs up for this guy. he was funny, but informative. i came to learn, he came to teach, we made a good pair. I would take another class with Mr Rosenberg as the professor",1
"Such a sweet guy. Class seems very difficult at first, but once you get the hang of it it's super easy. He grades solely on participation and completion of assignments. If you do what you're supposed to do, you will receive an A. You will spend each class discussing life, current events, history, etc. The class has no tests, quizzes, or final.",1
This guy is the man... period.,1
"Rick Brown is a very well-respected teacher. At first, he is one of the most intimidating people, but then he's like a goofy grandpa. He tells it like it is and he does not take any BS. If you want to be in his class and succeed, then you need to take it seriously. You need to make his class a top priority. It is a lot, but he's a big help.",1
Great teacher. Really funny and talks to you outside of class. Really enthusiastic about material and class is so much fun.,1
"Not understanding the negativity in other reviews. Dude's really enthusiastic about his field and knows what he's teaching backwards and forwards. Classes are very lecture-heavy, but I found that alright because he's a very good speaker. Take good notes and get a good mental model of the material, because it's hard to fake it on his tests/projects",1
Dr. Norris is a super smart person. The exams are 13 questions but worth a lot and the study guide is all you need and they are mentioned throughout the lectures. It was a good class during covid too. Theres a lot of information to cover but the study guide narrows it down. Study the study guide and start early!!!,1
"A mediocre course. Exams are tricky and entirely based on the textbook. Lectures simply regurgitate textbook material. 40% of your grade is based on 2 group projects. Coordinating a 15 page group research paper is no fun. Somewhat interesting subject matter but not presented in the most engaging manner. Nothing special, but > most MOS courses",1
He has been one of the best professor's this semester and I would take him the second semester if i could.,1
"This is a terrible class. DO NOT take him. He is not clear and makes you read a whole book for approximately 2-3 questions on the test. There are about 4/5 books. He does not care about the students and is rude and oblivious. One question on test is one percent of grade. Do not take, very bad class!",0
I learned a lot this class,1
"I absolutely love Professor G. It is truly evident that he is passionate about his teaching. Professor G makes sure you understand the information.. His organization, originally, was terrible, and as a student there were times I did not know that I needed to turn in. This quality, however, is improving, and this was seen at the end of the semester.",1
"He is a great professor, dont miss class, pay attention, listen and participate. He wants to prepare you for nursing school. His class is demanding but you can do well if you put in the effort. He is always available and approachable for questions or concerns. I enjoyed his humor and he really made me think and evaluate. I loved the class.",1
"Dr. Chalk is very good at leading discussions. When people don't have anything to say she'll input her own ideas. Participation definitely helps. There is a lot of reading, but it's also a lit course so what do you expect? Very available for help on essays. The books are interesting and she has good insights. She's also funny which helps",1
"she was so nice, i made sure to take another class that she taught!! i handed in a summary 2 weeks late and she gave me full credit!",1
"Assignments are given 2x a week based on textbook chapters. You have to come up with and answer your own questions (3). If a film is given there will be a DB. There was a midterm essay, short paper, and final essay. Do not plagiarize you will be penalized. Everything is clear and straightforward. First online class I've ever taken and I liked it.",1
She is the greatest spanish professor i've ever had.  Extremely helpful and enthusiastic.  Will get you interested in material even if you never thought it possible.  Take her if you ever get the chance!! She's great!,1
"She's an interesting professor and it is an easy class. You'll have one or two easy papers, and a few take home tests/quizzes. if you need a Cross-Cultural Perspective credit and want a A to boost your GPA, take this!",1
"Professor Quinlan is an amazing professor. He is such a sweetheart and I honestly enjoyed his lectures. He is really smart and holds so much knowledge, you honestly learn so much. Quinlan just wants you to do well, and he is a very understanding person. His tests are tough but they are fair. Taking him again in the fall. Would really recommend him.",1
"He's such a nice guy. He will give extensions if you are sincere. He cares about your time and will give you good feedback on papers. If you follow his rubrics and advice, your grades will reflect it.",1
"Heyborne is an amazing teacher! He cares about students and even remembers names. Tests are tough, he words things a bit tricky, but he schedules review sessions with his TA before every exam. You can always go to him for help. Exams are graded quickly, lectures are fun and he expects everyone to participate. You can see how much he loves science!",1
The best instructor ever! Wish I would have had her in high school....very patient and kind...made it fun and interesting.,1
"Im in 222 online. As an upper level course its challenging, for an A, but doable. Read, take notes, do posts, 2 papers & study. Rubric is clear & it is what you make it. I found it fascinating & you can get a real sense of the profs expertise in the field. Prof Wood is one of those rare special teachers that inspire & challenge. Highly rec!",1
Took Math81 with him and he is ok. He goes over all of the sections in a chapter and at then end of the chapter asks for the homework followed by a chapter exam. Also slips a 5 question quiz in the middle of the chapter. Attendance is not mandatory but it is reflected on how you on on the exams. ,1
"The better professor's class was full so I had to take Felber. She is a very strict grader. I'm a senior and have never encountered such harsh grading. Sociolinguistics can be a challenging subject. Don't add to that difficulty a teacher who subtracts points for petty, nonsubstantial reasons. If you must take the class, choose someone else.",0
"Mrs. Mudrick-Smiley was a great prof I had at DCCC.  As much as I hate English and all its ""to-the-point"" grammar, she made it fun and interesting, esp with the movie we watched with ""Boy in Striped Pajamas"". I'll be forever thankful for the great recommendation she gave me that helped me get into Temple. Take her if you want a good English class.",1
"Lectures are lengthy and he gives out many many long packets but he explains everything you need to know for tests in his lectures. He also gives examples with personal stories, there are lots of them. He is caring and doesn't really care if you show up, but will pull you aside to ask if everything is okay.",1
"GREAT INSTRUCTOR!!! only draw back is he will make you feel guilty if you don't join LAPD. I have taken every class available with him Many people say he is an easy teacher. NO! He is a teacher that can teach, therefore you learn! That why you passed! Always willing to help, especially when you want to join law enforcement. Take him!!",1
"Read, write, talk. Good teacher, no nonsense. Cute, too.",1
"Professor Wisner is the best English teacher, hands down. Take him for any English class, I promise you won't regret it. ) I've taken him for all mine and wish he taught higher level ones. :( He even dropped a test at the end of the semester which saved me. He is very clear with what he wants each week and the reading and discussions are easy.",1
"Not the best professor to start my 1st math class at LBCC. If you ask for help he'll laugh at your face. He teaches his material extremely fast and its hard to catch up. Basically, be prepared to teach yourself using math lab. The notes he gives out are super hard to understand and grading is harsh. Be prepared to go over 3 sections every meeting.",0
"Was my first SCC class  summer '15, very glad I took it. She would tell us when the schedule would change & clarified information when asked. Her lectures were interesting & helpful(sometimes got little tiring), went along well with the book.  Her stories were funny too. You MUST attend class.  Reading the book helps, a lot. She knows her stuff.",1
She was an amazing French prof. I learned a ton with her and she is extremely nice and caring. Grade is reflective of effort as her tests are very fair and she wants everyone to do well.,1
"This class is different from my high school math classes, it has a bunch of word problems which sucks but the teacher is so hot it makes up for it! :)",1
Very nice and knew that you had other classes to manage.,1
"Mr. Skrzypek obviously cares about his students, and he is always willing to help. The subject material is difficult, but Mr. S makes it interesting. Also, I personally think his jokes are funny. If you have to take an upper level philosophy course I recommend a course taught by Mr. S! ",1
I just took the final and can offically say that this class was a NIGHTMARE! I studied so hard and I still didn't do well. He made chem so difficult to understand. I actually think I know less coming out of this class than I did going in!,0
"Has a quirky sense of humor that is great in the middle of a lecture. Just an all-around awesome guy!! Class is simple, and still really cool. Simple math skills for the exams, otherwise, not much effort required and his slides are the reason to go to lecture, if you don't find astronomy interesting, that is. (Im a CSE major)",1
He is pretty hard to understand. Get the textbook so you will know what is going on. His in-class examples don't make sense and he writes in an unorganized manner. You will have no idea how to calculate your grade because he makes it up as you go through the semester. There are hardly any explained practice problems so you're screwed for the exams.,0
"Awful teacher. He does not actually direct you, and the lectures are pretty pointless to the homework which you are left to figure out on your own. He is arrogant and rude, and expects far too much from students who have never worked in the field. Will mark your papers as ""So what"" and ""irellevant"" but give zero direction.",0
"Goes off topic 90% of the time during the lecture. Super tough grader, always said we would do workshops in class to help people with what they were struggling with, but it never happened.",0
"She did not believe me when I told her a test was not open for me online and proceeded to give me a 0. I believe this says a lot about her as a person, and I do not recommend you take her class.",0
This will be the easiest yet most educational class you'll take as an undergrad. Mayor Street brings in many guest speakers which definitely contributed a lot to my learning and experience. He also gives minimal work/hw and is a great resource. Also he brings pizza the last class.,1
Mary Elfring is okay. She often will bring about current events which can be quite uncomfortable in my opinion. She gives more attention to certain students who talk more which is not right. Her classroom environment could be improved by allowing for balanced classroom discussion.,1
"She's passionate, classy, and intelligent. Overall, she's a great professor.",1
"Mr. Odien is a very good professor with a distinct drive and passion for what he does. His well-presented lectures are important to your success in the class and his personality makes everything interesting. He is always available to help, even during tests. That being, if you're looking for an easy class or dislike geology, I wouldn't take him.",1
Just the nicest lady ever. Honestly don't really have to go to class as long as you keep up in the text. Exams are all multiple choice and she tells you how to prepare. Can also fall behind and prioritize other classes if you catch up on the reading in time for quizzes and exams. Great combination of easy class in which I actually learned a lot.,1
I was nervous to take bio but Ms Mcgee made it so easy to understand! Tests were all from the powerpoint and reviews for each test were online so there was never any confusion on what would be on the test. Hoping I can take  her again for bio 2,1
10/10 hot af or bms,1
He is such a good professor with many inspirational lectures. He is a lenient grader and gives strong feedback on papers. I truly respect him! Take him for inspirational lectures and funny stories as well as an easy A!,1
"She posts podcasts of her lectures which is really helpful for off campus students. The tutorials are boring and pointless, but the content in her lectures is very interesting. She is very passionate about what she is teaching. Her tests are also super fair, just do the readings and pay attention in lecture",1
"Had her as one of my professors during the first semester of the pandemic, she was the only prof i had who did not give extensions on assignments and was not understanding/caring AT ALL to students needs. If you have something personal happening in your life dont expect her to be lenient with you.",0
"Professor Laucella is an amazing professor. 1st year seminar classes can seem unimportant and boring, but professor laucella makes it so much better. She genuinely cares for her students and will do anything to better their education. Not a tough grader, we took a few quizzes and easy projects10/10 suggest taking her for KSU first year seminar!!",1
"She's a very tough grader but if you thoroughly--and I mean thoroughly--edit and revise your paper's it's more likely to get a better grade. Class was a little boring, and it was mildly tough to pass with a B. She doesn't respond quickly to emails but is willing to help out if needed.",1
"Best professor Ive had at FIU. EVERYTHING is on the Power Points. Very nice, he will help you if you show that you care.",1
"I really wanted to enjoy this class because of the subject, but Professor Sewell makes it hard to. I've taken more academically rigorous classes, yet this professor has the harshest standards of grading I've witnessed so far. She does give instructions, but even when you try to adhere to her standards, it's not good enough. Regret signing up.",0
Loved this class. Lectures were always interesting and he is very knowledgeable about child psych. Gives a lot of opportunity for extra credit. I also liked how he had the students interact every class. Gave me the opportunity to meet my class mates.,1
"Been in college for five years and he's my favorite professor. Very willing to work with students who are struggling (approachable). Explains grammar concepts in a clear way. Brings outside sources into class lectures, like Arab music artists, poets, etc., so students get a taste of native syntax and culture. A wise, charming, hilarious man. ",1
Professor Goldman is a good professor with a pretty easy grading scale. Her tests can be difficult with the lectures hard to follow through. Make sure you ask questions!,1
Learned allot. He is very detailed. Knows his stuff.  Adds fun to class.,1
He's a really funny dude. sometimes gives ppt lectures but most of the class is completing assignments with a group. The assignments are a little difficult. Multiple exams & they are difficult. Absolutely read the textbook & attend class. I'd only reccommend if you're a soc major. I'm a soc minor and found it difficult,1
"Ning is great at his lectures, he is very inclusive with all students. His tests are very straightforward and he tells you what is going to be on the exam. You are allowed a notecard on the exams, so it is very easy to maneuver. Take Physics with Ning!",1
The class itself is very boring. Most days she will drone on over the same concepts and it felt like a high school English class. Easier than both AP Language and Literature. There's no reading other than a few articles for maybe 5 class discussions.,1
"Such a caring and down-to-earth teacher, he really makes sure that you not only know what you're doing on a big assignment, but also provides some in-depth feedback to help elevate your abilities. He is a quick responder to, which is great given the current situation.",1
I love you Professor Conta all I have to say. His compassionate in all that he does and goes out of his way to make sure every single student is able to succeed. Keep up the good work you have a nice surprise before you retire at the end of this semester.,1
"Not an extremely difficult class, but hard to do well in unless your opinions agree with his. Assigns reading every night, but goes over them everyday so reading isn't completely necessary.",0
"She cares and she knows her stuff that's all that matters if you care she cares Cliche, but you get what you give  I recommend her to anyone taking mkt research",1
"Has an accent, but while it is easy to discern what words are coming out of his mouth, it is impossible to understand what he is talking about. He spends every lecture covering the board in equations and theorems that will never be used on any problems and does not explain what they do. After the first test the class becomes impossible do not take.",0
"He is a good teacher. He is fair, clear and punctual. I am not so sure whether he cares for the students, but he did what he had to do and he did them very well. If you have basic math skills that are reqruired to take this class, he will make your life so easier. He also marks and returns the assignments and exams timely.",1
Class could of been more about what I was expecting to take other than something I was not even expecting to take,0
"She has very strong opinions and pretends to play devil's advocate. She challenges you to fight her opinion, and trust me-you won't win. She brought up current politics and made her opinions into facts. Would never take again and do not think she should be teaching history, or really anything at all.",0
I learned a lot about culture in foreign countries that I was not aware of. A very artistic and motherly type of woman with much compassion.,1
Professor Susan is responsible and the best instructor ever. Her lectures are amazing. I learned a lot from her in every aspect. Take Care!,1
"She is interesting teacher, but does need to work on controlling the VOLUME OF HER VOICE.  Take notes like crazy on her lectures, lots of her tests are on her own material.  She is really nice if you talk to her outside of class I find.",1
"Great professor, very helpful and gives very clear assignments, with due dates always posted at the beginning of the week, so you always know when something is due. Textbook is NEEDED! Only con is he takes forever to grade papers so it takes 2-3 weeks till you get your results.... However he replies really fast to emails, and very helpful!",1
"I have mixed feelings about this professor. He's a really nice guy and is very accessible, but sometimes he can be unclear when explaining his lectures. Luckily, the lectures are posted so you can go back and review it. My only problem with this class was how harshly the homework was graded. You'll do better on the exams than the HW.",1
you read about teachers telling funny stories..but this guy seriously tells the best stuff.. his lectures are half talking about his trips to different countires.. whenever we asked to go home.. 9 times out of 10 he'd say ya alright see you next time.. awesome teacher,1
"He's a very nice person and I learned some things in his class, but I would have enjoyed more challenge. It got a little confusing. I took the class virtually and I think it would have been better in person.",1
"Very helpful,skilled teacher.",1
"Professor Sherwood is really awesome. If you have problems, talk to her. She is very open and is willing to listen. There is a Research paper that is a major part of your grade, Aplia questions, and a discussion most weeks. If you respond to the students and her, it will be easy.",1
She is no help. ,0
Such a nice and caring professor. The material isn't easy but she prepares you well for exams and tries to make lab as enjoyable and stress-free as possible. Definitely take her!,1
"I love LaBelle. Her office hours are nearly always available and she makes the class engaging as possible. While her tests can be tricky (lots of essay questions and short answers), she really wants you to understand the material and has a passion for it. Overall, great teacher, would recommend.",1
"Well, she's thorough but gives too much info so you have to sort through to find the relevant stuff. Quizes aren't too bad if you do the reading. Essay marks are sort of low. She's nice, and tends to give the same mark based on first assignment",1
She's pretty cool and the class is a lot of readings. Attendance isn't mandatory but the whole class grade rides on a group project and she gives pop quizzes a few times. She's a pretty fair grader once you have to do papers and there's no final except for a group presentation.,1
Loved this class. Best teacher I have had by far. Would reccomend him 110%. I wish he taught more than just acc and dpr,1
"Super sweet and passionate. She very obviously cares about her students. Lectures are usually interesting, but she strays off topic very easily. Not very much actually material was covered in the class because she gets off topic so easily. The class was enjoyable and I still learned a lot from her, even if not all of it was from the textbook. TAKE!",1
Terrible teacher. She puts you down.,0
Good professor. Helpful where it counts.,1
Show up to Intro to Civil and get an A as long as you take the weekly surveys after each class. Voss doesn't really even stay for the lecture as it is given by a guest professor each week.,1
"Extremely nice professor. She was always available to help, whether in class or in her office. Knowledgeable, made lectures and assignments fun. However, you've gotta put in effort on projects. No worries though, they're fun. Definitely take her. There's a reason why her classes fill up so fast.",1
"THIS CLASS IS NOT AN EASY A. He makes terrible jokes and the class is not interactive. He never explains a specific topic but gives out long random examples that are not really helpful or explanatory. Operations Mgmt is an interesting subject, said everyone but I hate it because of him. You'll need a textbook that he wrote and is available for $90 ",0
"WORST PROFESSOR EVER!!!!!!!!!! I cannot emphasize how bad she is! I don't know where she came from or who does she think she is but she acts as if nothing else is going on but her own class. Avoid her at all costs!!! I won't be surprised if i don't see her here next semester. For what is worth, she is left with 3 students for the rest of the year.",0
"She's sweet, but I cannot understand her for the life of me. I've tried attending the lectures and she has online lecture recordings but her English is terrible. She's not good at explaining. To do well on the exams you HAVE to KNOW the book front and back and do the online modules and hw. No one did well on her exams, the test averages were awful",0
"Susan (or SK) is AWESOME, by far the best prof I've had. But be warned, you do need to bring your A game for her class and be ready to work. She just wants her students to put forth effort and not think they'll cruise by with doing nothing. If you're interested in script writing, taking her is a must! Textbooks are script writing guide books FYI.",1
"Unorthodox teaching method, all quizzes are online and timed, and very tough. Study the terms and artifacts on blackboard as often as possible. In class work is a hit or miss, so show up as much as possible. One quiz over each section as well as a short essay, and a final essay that he gives you a week in advance. Study thoroughly for this essay.",1
"Mr. Crittenden taught survey of math for the first time when the previous professor fell through. He seems like a genuinely caring man who wants his students to succeed. He writes everything out on the board, helps you if you need it, and lets you retake tests. His lectures can be a bit relaxing but you just need to bring some coffee to class!",1
"I enjoyed the feedback & resources Marco offered. My complaints were mostly in the content of films he chose to continuously show in class. There was little to NO inspiration and motivation in students and the art work suffered b/c of that. Marco was funny, but his humor is swallowed by a select few. I'm an older student and enjoyed him very much.",1
"This class was a podium for him to spit his political views out. We actually got told that fantasy football is a construct to keep the white man in power over the black man. Don't be fooled by the name of the class, this has very little to do with sports themselves. The second half of this class is an attack on corporate America and how to ""resist""",0
"Honestly, I am fairly confident that she wrote all of the positive reviews herself. I am an 'A' student, but I don't know anyone who would speak well of her. She is unclear in her expectations, terrible to communicate with, and doesn't understand student questions at all. I got a decent grade in the class, but I would seriously NEVER take it again.",0
"Do your homework, study guides, and read. He is passionate with the subject because he has worked in the field before teaching.",1
lectures are unorganized and boring. Feedback i recieved on my papers (which were the majority of the grading) were 1-2 bullet points that were not constructive at all. I wish i didn't take this course.,0
This is an awesome class. Pam knows everything about teaching language arts and is especially well read in children's literature. She is extremely supporting and nice. Would recommend!,1
"Very nice guy! He talks about himself a lot, but did a great job of structuring a class that was both workshop and lecture. All of our work was based around reading and writing creatively. Take his class if you can, he's a really solid professor.",1
Dr. Jones is an amazing person. I think that she would be a great person to collaborate with if you're interested in community service. As a professor.. not so much. I personally did not like how this class flowed. I loved the main goals and the purpose for this course but I hated the unnecessary assignments. Only got harder when we moved online.,1
"Mr. Bannow is clearly very intelligent. He expects everyone to try their hardest in his class. The syllabus he provides at the beginning of the semester can be followed exactly, so you know when every test, quiz, and homework assignment is due. If you go to class, read the text, and do the homework assignments then you will do great.",1
"Professor Mensah is a great professor who incorporated relevant news into the lectures. The course was straightforward. The required chapter summaries were few, but rather lengthy because they were to be single-spaced and 11pt font. I suggest holding him to the material in the provided test study guides, in case the answer varies on the test.",1
"Very fair course. Yes, I won't lie, his lectures are quite unclear, but if you follow along in the book and do all the homework you will do fine in this class. The tests were difficult and there's a quiz almost every class but just put in the work. very nice and he will help you if you seek it. Take him over sepinsky.",0
"Dr. Shahrava has a very good understanding of what he does and has the potential to be a great professor, but his lack of organization or communication makes understanding his lectures impossible. Reading the textbook will usually save you with profs like this, too bad the exam questions are pulled from concepts in his lectures and not the book.",0
"Doesn't keep promises on when he will grade stuff. His notes are over 30+ pages because he gives a lot of extra flip flap about personal stuff you don't need to know. When you ask for cut and dry clarity, he still gives you a lot of flip flap. It's supposed to be an online class, yet you have to take the tests in person. The final is cumulative!!!!",0
"He was okay. Based on these ratings I was looking more forward to this class, but was disappointed. Class got a little boring because I don't have that much interest in the Bible. But he seems like a nice enough guy.",0
"As long as you put in a meager amount of effort, show up, and participate occasionally, you'll get an A. I'm confident in writing, so this class wasn't difficult, but I saw many people not show up and fail. The paper is written during the entire semester, and he's very forgiving and flexible. Do the small assignments too, they help in the end.",1
"I'd recommend everyone who's going into medical or Biology field to take her class. Don't take it if you just need a science elective. I took 3 classes with her and I loved it! She really prepares you to be a medical field student. And if you can't keep up, well.. You may want to reconsider your career path because it's not going to get any easier",1
"Excellent professor! Has a passion for math that is contagious. Very understanding and willing to explain any/all questions students have. Didn't use the book, only the access code that goes with it (can be purchased separately online). Do the homework assignments (only a few examples per unit) and study.",1
"Not only is she very clear about everything (assignments, lectures, etc.), she is a really funny, entertaining teacher.",1
"The absolute best instructor I've had at Baker. Most instructors don't understand learning online, but Vincent absolutely does. He gives great feedback and the tools to actually learn.",1
"Easy A, but the class is taught like a high school class. You have to show up to lecture and do worksheets. There is a lot of busy work.",0
Good teacher,1
"Good lectures, You have to work for your grade in BIO 108 he give packets of lectures and you're supposed to memorize it for the exam 4 exams the lowest is dropped but not the final. For Bio 109 you do the lab and every time you go back to class you have a quiz on the previous lab and he only drops 2 lab. You have to do a lot of studying for an A.",1
"I had to learn everything from Khan Academy. I have no doubt he might be good in-person but online his videos are 10 minutes for what is supposed to be an hour lecture. He only does ONE problem per section, and his mind seems very scattered. I am not LEARNING from him. I feel like I'm being set up for failure for the future in his online course.",0
Amazing prof...funny...not a textbook teacher! Real world stuff--you have to study your notes to get a good grade(ps.I dont know who that other person was rating--totally NOT TRUE),1
"A little sporadic, but was always available for outside help... Even left his cell number on the syllabus so we could get in touch with him for questions.",1
"In lab, he was always willing to help and he was good at giving explanations and clearing things up. Overall, he's a great professor. It seems like he wants everyone succeed in the class unlike most other professors who make it clear that they don't care.",1
"Oustanding professor!  He was very tough, but he made the material so interesting.  He greatly improved my writing and he always cared--deeply--for students.  He made a lasting, positive impression.",1
"Really easy to get in contact with, which is important for online. I had an exam time out and submit prior to finishing and she was able to reopen it for me when I texted her. In this class, you get out of it what you put into it. You can read the chapters and learn, or you can find the answers for the assignment that week quickly if you're rushed.",1
Dr. Mckenna is A M A Z I N G!! He is a GREAT. You will be missing a looot if you don't take his classes.,1
He/TA's are very helpful! tests aren't super hard if you pay attention in lecture. i really like that the notes were available online when needed for homework help.,1
"Great Teacher , extremly helpful, orgainzed and harmonous. You pay tuition to learn from somone not to read it out of a book and he does just that.",1
"MS. MAGALLON IS ONE OF THE BEST ENGLISH TEACHERS AT CHABOT. VERRRRRY HELPFUL, NICE, SMART, CLEAR, UNDERSTANDING, SEEMS HAPPY TO TEACH NOT LIKE OTHER TEACHERS. A LOT OF GROUP WORK. WHICH MEANS MEETING NEW PEOPLE!! SHE IS THE BEST TEACHER EVER. U WONT REGRET TAKING HER. SIGN URSELF UP FASSSSSSSST!!",1
"Yes, a lot of reading.  Yes, a lot of discussion.  But the class makes you think, and that's what I like about it.  Additionally, Prof. Lawrence is very understanding and willing to help you out if there is a real issue.  He really does care about his students' experience.  Definitely worth taking his class!",1
Very chill teacher a lot of work once a week but its really not that difficult i took him twice because its a very chill class,1
"Best chemistry professor at UMD. He can seem condescending in office hours but it's bc he doesn't re-teach you anything, he makes you figure it out which can feel stressful. He follows the textbook but I never opened the textbook and got an A. Just know everything in lecture very well and do all practice problems over and over and check w/ him.",1
"Slides really helped get the info across. If you fall behind, you're toast.",1
"Reyes teaches more of immersion style, and participation matters. If you do the work and show up for class, and he knows you're trying, he can be generous with grades. Learning another language is hard and he knows it. Very responsive to emails and willing to meet before class. Genuinely cares about students and checks in with everyone often.",1
"He teaches you useful things and if you have questions he will answer them. He thoroughly goes over things before tests (if class isn't understanding it he will push the test). There is a lot of homework, but you work on it in class if you need to. Useful real world material, he's funny and easy going.",1
The other recent review is 100% correct. He doesn't acknowledge technical issues and is not clear about what material is on which quiz. The material is VERY disorganized and instructor isn't helpful at all. Either ignores emails/discussions or just responds that he thinks everything is self-explanatory. Many students post questions that are ignored,0
"Dr. Day is about as average as it gets. He is by no means bad, but his lectures are a little difficult to understand at times. It's clear that he knows his material, but does not teach it in an effective manner. That being said, he can look at code and know exactly what the problem is in a one-on-one session. He is very friendly outside of class.",1
She is so incredibly boring. I thought that the class material was going to be really fun and exciting but it was such a let down. Could have done a lot more interesting things in the class and instead it is the one class I dread going to the most. Seems to be pretty easy though.,1
His h.w are incredibly long and he takes points off for everything (have to include where in the textbook you found equation and do a sketch diagram for every question). when you answer questions for his oral exam he doesn't give you any feedback just a grade. incredibly hard class. the only good part is that it's an open book test. Do Not Take.,0
I learned interesting things about marketing which was cool since it isn't my major. I never read the textbook and only studied the powerpoints for the tests and did fine. Test questions can be tricky so really read them and try to understand what the answer is supposed to be. Do your best on MindTap b/c in the end it's a big portion of the grade.,1
I took this class during my last semester at UCF. Self is the best Prof in this program- he is very passionate and interesting.  The easiest way to ace his class is GO TO CLASS- record lectures and study from that material- don't waste any money on the book.,1
"DO NOT TAKE CLASS WITH HIM!!  I am a straight ""A student who is struggling to keep my grade up.  He has a 1 week, three assignments rule, original posts must be made within 3 days plus 3 additional on 3 separate days will give you a 79/100 he expects you to go above the ""required"" in order to get a good grade.  I emailed and got a rude response.",0
He is an awesome professor that knows his stuff. Only assigns hw when necessary but rarely (9 worksheets the whole semester). The lectures are very interesting and very detailed. He tells you what is on the test just make sure you don't cheat. I highly recommend taking his class.,1
"This is a difficult class, but it is doable. You just need to read, pay attention, take notes, and study. Dr. Hollis loves his subject, and that makes it easier to learn. There are enough grades in the class to help your grade. He gives great feedback on tests, and you will have lecture and lab quizzes.",1
She is soooo hot! Take this professor! She is very helpful outside of the classroom!,1
"Field trips for the Twin Cities History course were great; we got to hear from a lot of cool people. Classes were chock full of fascinating info. Lectures could run long, but were consistent with class length.  As for grading, there were only 3 paper assignments (writing intensive), and he was a fair grader. Would take another class with him!",1
"Excellent professor. Hilarious, fun, and good.",1
"Probably one of the easiest classes I've taken, ever. As long as you're able to complete all of your assignments on MyMathLab, and partake in the discussion boards, ON TIME, you will pass this class. She has a strict-late work policy.  Also, if you're passing the class with an 85% or higher, you're exempt from taking the final exam ",1
Its an online class so u are on ur own. Textbook is a must and u have to teach urself by reading it. The material is hard to learn on ur own. Weekly homework assignments are hard and discussion board is a lot to do at the last day since u need to write an essay for full credit. But in class review classes make ur mind blown. Dont take eco online,1
"Fantastic teacher.  Ms. Fox is a very tough teacher, but you will learn a lot from her class.  She responds to emails in a very timely manner and is always willing to help, if you ask.  Hands down the best teacher I have ever had.  If given the opportunity, take her class!",1
This instructor is great. I really enjoyed her class and would take other classes taught by her. ,1
Took her during the summer session! She gives a lot of extra credit so it makes it possible for you to pass. She does go off topic a bit during lecture but she teaches well.,1
"Unbelievable professor. She is the root of what it means to be a good teacher and she works every day to show that. She always shows up with a smile on her face and she's enthusiastic about everything. She uses great examples and replies to e-mails very fast. All in all, my favorite professor at UMD. ",1
"He is honestly one of the best professors I've ever had.  He's incredibly intelligent and knowledgeable, but really funny and nice too.  Wish he could teach every class!",1
Pam was a very good prof.  I enjoyed her class and it was very organized.  She has so much to share and really gets you excited about literature and strategies. It's a lot of work but all worthwhile to the teaching profession.  Put the time and interest into it-it's worth it.,1
The class wasn't all that difficult and it is my fault for slacking off towards the end. But he was easily the worst CS professor I have ever had. I'm not sure if it was just me but the way he taught the class and interacted with students made me feel very unmotivated to participate. I would avoid taking a class with him at all costs.,0
"A&P is a difficult class, given the large amount of information. Dr. R is not hard. If you pay attention to her powerpoints and focus on her study guides then you should be fine. You have to study consistently to retain the information. She has a great voice that keeps you focused and gives great ways to remember the material. She is the best!",1
"While his lectures were excellent and he knows his study, Mr Schlortt seemed vague and inconsistent in his feedback on papers and took off points from every minuscule mistake imaginable. His quizzes and ""cartoon analyses"" are extremely rushed in class (he hangs over you if you haven't finished in 5 or 10 minutes) and rigorously graded.",0
"He was the best professor I have ever had. I learned so much from his example of a good person, and great teacher. Thanks to him I am a better counselor.",1
I expected more from the Director of the School of Social Work. Very surface level course. Be prepared to spend 10 minutes of every class talking about football.,1
Really nice guy but the man is the most boring teacher I have ever had.  He is monotone with a constant stone face expression.  The man barely has a pulse!  Seems like he might not be a tougher grader however and that is a plus.,1
"Don't take this guy. He doesn't care about teaching and he'll basically blow through class with his powerpoint. He asks hard questions in class and doesn't give you time to read the question. He does the problems correctly so write everything down and learn it later, at least that's how I did. midterms aren't bad, but try to not take this guy",0
"I wouldn't recommend taking this class with her if you have little background in stats. She assumes the class knows more than they actually do, so she tends to skip many steps when doing problems. She won't take responsibility for the class doing poorly (My class had a 62 average for exam 1 and said ""it wasn't her fault"")",0
Great teacher but very tough grader!  She gives fair exams and is willing to accommodate her students.,1
"I took Alison for BIO127, A & P 1 twice, A&P 2 twice. I retook both courses because I wanted a better chance at getting in the nursing program. I retook them specifically with Alison because although difficult, she is very thorough and literally prepares you for nursing school. Not an easy A, but the BEST teacher if you're going into nursing!",1
"The content was interesting and Prof. Gentry is so funny. Assignment-wise, there is so much reading that you HAVE to take notes on, 5 speeches, and in-class discussions. You need to put in the work to pass and pay attention. The homework takes a while but stay ahead and you'll be fine. TYPICALLY REQUIRED FOR NURSING!",1
Great teacher! easy tests..  tough grader on assignments and mock trial i would recommend taking  her,1
Mrs Schultz is a great instructor. I had her last semester and she made sure I had a good understanding of the work and even too the time to work with me privately. Make sure you do the lab work and that will be very helpful.,1
"Kind, compassionate and amazing professor. Helps everyone understand the material, which is very difficult in this course. The extra credit helps a lot and is worth doing. Tests are tough and requires lots of prep from the study guides, questions in office hours or email, and taking good notes in class. Overall, tough course but well worth it.",1
"Sweetest prof out there! He makes stats really accessible to students who have no math/stats background and always provides example questions and past quizzes/exams so you know what to expect when you're tested. He's ALWAYS available for questions, and even had office hours on weekends because he genuinely wants his students to succeed.",1
"Arevelo is a terrible teacher. She has a very heavy accent which makes it difficult to understand her lecture, as well as making it easy to loose focus and interest. If you have to miss an exam the only time you can make it up is 2 days before the final(she will not budge with this even if you have a good reason). Test are very hard. DO NOT TAKE!",0
The work is very easy and he explains what he expects of you for each assignment. Reading the book helps a lot. If you keep up with the work and pass the quizzes you can get an A.,1
He is one of the best Math Teachers I have had. He goes above and beyond to make sure you understand his material.,1
Studied abroad with her in London. One of the best instructors i've ever had!,1
"He is the best professor so far, he really cares about his students. The lectures are fun.  He is really clear about the topics. There are 2quizzes 1 Midterm and 1 Final. Its an easy A if you understand the content, you dont have to study that much , just listen the songs and understand the influences.",1
"Class is smarter than she is. You can argue your answers and get credit for being wrong pretty much as long as you have a good arguement. She moves off topic a lot and is easily distracted by student dicussion. She also favors to a degree. Easy to make her favor you, sound smart and outgoing. I prefer her class over any else because she's so easy..",0
He is a fun teacher and makes taking core history fun. He uses slides which helps with taking notes and as long as you show up to class you will understnad the material as he explains it extremely well. Would take him again.,1
"Snarky but in a good-natured, all in good fun, type of way and likes having a good time. He is very accessible and as long as you meet him half way and do your part effort-wise he will go out of his way to help you understand the material. Very smart and really knows how to breakdown the concepts. Put in the effort and your grade will reflect.",1
"Class is lecture only, but very interesting! If you don't come to class you probably won't get an A, though you may pass. He will write down what you need to know but anything he says is fair game on a test, so pay attention! No homework; grade is based on test scores. If you have any interest in music you will ENJOY this class and instructor!",1
Seems intimidating at first but he really cares about the student and he's really good at answering questions if necessary. He gave my friend a full text book for free.,1
lectures are for videos. the content you teach yourself with the textbook so may as well take it online. weekly quiz based on textbook questions so absolutely need the textbook. overall was very boring but easy class,0
Hes super loud but nice. When someone asks a question he goes off in a rabbit hole but other than that hes nice. Dont sit in the front of the class otherwise you will go deaf... the tests are hard but the homework is easy. He doesnt even read it he just checks that you did it. He offers one extra credit at the end of the semester but its long.,1
I had Scott for ICU clinical and went on study abroad to Ecuador with him. Best professor ever. Cares about students and their learning. Able to explain challenging concepts and be for students after difficult days at the hospital.,1
"Do not take a class with her. She made me hate math. She does not teach and expects you to teach yourself. She is a real stickler with grading, does not matter if you get the answer right if you don't show enough work. There really is no need to make a student's life miserable. Her notes are not useful and gives a lot of homework. She is baddddd.",0
"I think the curriculum for SPAN302 is poorly designed, with too much busywork, both in class and for homework, and not nearly enough opportunities to have conversations and actually learn Spanish. With that said, Professor Newall did his best to work with it, and he is a very caring professor, so I'm sure he will improve, as this was his first year",1
"I took this class thinking it would be easy and I was wrong. Valliere is a tough grader, and although incredibly blunt to where it can be borderline rude, he gives great feedback and is an amazing professor that will push you out of your comfort zone. It is clear that he is passionate about his work, and I could not recommend this professor more.",1
"I took this class online and I have never regretted anything more. The material we were told to study was nowhere near what was on the tests/quizzes. Instead of understanding and being accommodating, she was accusatory, rude, and dismissive! Every week, something went wrong. If this class had been taught by anyone else, it would have been great.",0
"Course is well-structured, perhaps because Dr. Longridge has had tons of experience. There was quite a bit of work from assignments, groupwork, and the readings. But it's clear what's expected. She's reasonable - once I asked Dr. Longrdige for access to future reading material since I wanted to get ahead in the course and she granted me access.",1
"I can actually speak Japanese now. Professor Garrisi emphasizes that students speak in Japanese everyday in class. Be prepared to be called on several timers per class, and reply in Japanese. I loved this. She was amazing and funny!",1
"He is very VERY easy going. The class is more of a think tank where you share your ideas AND GET CREDIT FOR IT. He understands life happens and will give extensions as long as you have a good reason. If I could I would use him for all my classes. If you have the chance to take him, I would recommend him.",1
The lectures are boring but that was expected considering it was a Gen Ed bio class.  I always felt aware of what material would be on the tests. There are a few hwk assignments.  He seems like a really nice guy and i would recommend him for the bio 101 class. If you study for the tests you should have no problem passing the class.,1
Had him for summer ochem 1 and was blown away. Unlike every other stem professor Ive had he actually cares more about teaching students than his own research and is willing to go above and beyond to make sure you comprehend everything. Definitely take his class if you have the option,1
"Took this class on friday class was 4 hours long and honestly didn't even feel like 4 hours. He gives good discussion topics and most of them are to prep you for out of class essays as well as in class ones. He is a fair grader. Tip: take advantage of rough draft days, have him read it. Amazing. Take his class!!! Replies to emails quick too.",1
I enjoyed Dr. Batman's class.  He is a fair grader.  I had never taken a physics class in my life and made a B in this class.  Do your homework and read for quizzes and things will come easier for you.  You have to take this class seriously.  Do not expect to coast through it.  Dr. Batman is very dry but he guides you through the class very well.,1
an easy class to take as long as you study for your tests. only 2 papers to write throughout the semester but they're very easy. vartinian is such a kind and caring professor. she really does care about her students' well being and constantly encourages us to seek help if we need it and to help us live our best lives as possible.,1
"He is one of the best professor I had at ASU, he teaches the material really well and is generous about assignment extension.",1
"Pretty easy class if you know what you're doing. Explains the assignments the day of, step by step, so it's hard to get a bad mark. Grading criteria is confusing on the final assignment, as there is no real rubric. Takes a lot of time for each assignment but he gives you a lot of lab time and it is due at midnight. Overall, an easy A.",1
she knows her stuff.  helpful and funny.,1
No Comments,1
Take this class to get credit for a plan letter knowing we signed up for a introduction class. Then he says if you have a brain youll get b or better and talks politics half the time. He grades and talks to us like this is a class in my major and I will be taking religion for the next 3 years. Hes got to understand were taking it for a letter.,0
Professor Wolf is probably one of the best professors Ive had at UC Davis. Shes very organized and the content she teaches is digestible and relevant. Very nice woman and very understanding!,1
The class itself is really good.  A lot of group activities.  The essays are easy and fun to do.  I would highly recommend this professor.,1
"Dr. Guerriero is a really sweet lady, and if you show up to class and do all your work, you will pass easily. I really liked her, and the class might not have been interesting at all, but you learn a lot that is really beneficial. If I would have to take this class over again, I would definitely take her as my professor, and I highly recommend her!",1
"I highly recommend Prof Rarick, he is knowledgeable about statistics and posses the skills of a genuinely good teacher. He has an educational psychology background so he cares about helping students learn. His lectures are clearly and well organized and they conceptually explain the math and steps to solving statistical problems.",1
"Excellent teacher. Course structure is clear. Class is fun. Requires more than a little effort, but is totally reasonable compared to some classes. Would recommend to anyone serious about learning Italian.",1
"LOVE HIM. Professor Caruso is not big on grading, but rather what you learn and how you understand the material. Easy A for sure, the bulk of the grading is based on participation",1
"Professor Pave is, hands down, the best instructor at SBVC. His classes are interesting and you will receive daily instruction. He is encouraging and allows creativity and free thought. He responds to his email daily and I am sad that I have taken all of his classes that are available at Valley.",1
Dr. Yamazaki is one of the hardest but most amazing professors Ive ever taken! Although her tests and quizes can be brutal she trully cares about her students and prepares you for any professional program. Take her physiology courses if you want to learn and can handle a chanllenge.,1
He is my favorite forever!,1
grades harshly and doesn't accept any late work no matter the reason. I won't take her again or recommend her class to anyone,0
"Dr. Rickerson is such a lovely person.  She's a very compassionate European Lefty in one of California's bastions of what's-in-it-for-me conservatism.  She is entertaining, goes of on really enjoyable tangents and has lots to say about all sorts of things.  If you want to learn about architecture, while being entertained, take her class.",1
No Comments,1
"He is simply one of the kindest people you will ever meet. He is so open about everything and really makes everyone in class feel comfortable about sharing personal experiences. He has a huge background of schooling and knowledge. He really knows a lot and teaches you in a fun, easy way.",1
Super helpful and understand. He tries his best to make the class comfortable and to ease speaking anxiety.,1
"this class is really fun and interesting.  You learn so much about movies, film making and directors.  plus.  hes friggen hot.",1
come to participate or dont bother with this class. at first i didnt participate and my grade reflected my effort. i went to him complaining and he asked me why I was taking the course? I changed my attitude and my grade got better. dont blame Matt if you dont intend to put the effort into this class,1
"Dr. Marlow is super fun. He has a hard time getting through the material because he encourage class discussion. He knows how to explain things so student's understand. Though there was one time where I emailed him a question and his reply was ""it's in the syllabus"".  The syllabus is 13 pages long. Just sayin. Into to Linguistics is very interesting",1
"This teacher is really nice! you have to buy her books for 80 dollars and you get two, its totally worth it because her tests are exactly from the study guides at the end of the chapter. the only reason you cant understand her is she has a really thick greek accent. other than that really easy class and pretty interesting.",1
"He can be interesting, but he records and posts all his lectures and slides online. The text was very interesting. He is a bit rude. Had no problem until grades were released and it said I hadn't taken the final, which I had. He ended up losing my scantron and giving me a lower grade then I had earned. His TA was useless.",0

"Russ Powell is super nice and answers any questions you have. The lectures are extremely dry, he wrote the textbook too so you dont get anything extra going to class. Easy to do well if study the textbook.",1
HES A NICE FUN TEACHER. HE GAVE US SO MUCH FEEDBACK AND DOES GRADES RIGHT AWAY. HE'S LIVELY AND MADE CLASS FUN I HAD TOOK COM10 WITH HIM LOVED IT AND THEN TOOK COM30 HE IS THE BEST I LOVE HIM HE MAKES EVERY PROJECT FUN YOU GET YOUR MONEYS WORTH THE LAST DAY OF CLASS HE DID NOT MAKE US DO THE FINAL SINCE WE CAME ON TIME INSTEAD WE THREW A PARTY (:,1
"I highly recommend Dr. Jones for senior seminar, even if you didn't like her in Genetics! She has a completely different demeanor in this course; she's very warm and understanding. Now listen closely when I say this: THIS WOMAN'S CAREER ADVICE IS INCREDIBLE. I did not expect to get much out of this course, but now I'm so glad I took it with her!",1
"Grades given are very confusing. Would not recommend unless taken pass-fail. Otherwise, you can attend every class and work really hard and think you will get an A and then end up with something much worse.  In terms of class material, the dance class feels more like yoga. Would recommend looking at other classes like Ballet or Jazz dance.",0
Number 1,1
"This class has been my favorite thus far. Dr. Chalk is a great lecturer, the topics and novels were very interesting, and everyone was always involved in class discussions. I am very glad to have been able to tak one of Dr. Chalk's classes!",1
"I had him his 1st semester too, it was awful. big waste of time to be honest, I hope he has gotten better, for everyones sake",0
"Gets uncomfortable if you have different political views than him, which he voices very clearly. Lots of difficult reading. Main journal assignment is difficult because he wants it done before class which is before he actually teaches anything. Absolutely no feedback and grades wildly different each time. Yells a lot. Did learn a little though",0
"Incredible, helpful and super nice. If you take his class and you study, you'll pass easily",1
"she goes off topic a lot, makes it hard to pay attention and understand her",0
"This lady is a demon...I dreaded going to her class. She told the class do not ask her any questions, she is not a tutor. She gives directions, but sometimes there is notn clarity so u are lost on the assignment. She is a total nightmare!!!!",0
"Great professor, really enjoyed the class. Makes an effort to get to know all his students and is very enthusiastic about the class and subject matter. The class isn't too hard and the material is interesting.",1
"Professor is nice and understanding. Expect a pretty full (but bearable) work load, but she gives great feedback and makes the class fairly interesting.",1
"Great! You learn a lot. She will help you and answers e-mails in a timely manner. Plan on writing. You can make an A, but you will work for it.",1
Gives consistent feedback on everything. Requires you to source from the class textbook on almost every assignment. The assignments were discussions and essays with one extra credit opportunity. Took the class to satisfy requirements. Overall I found it to be pretty boring. If you enjoy learning about theories and statistics then you'll like this.,1
"Very nic, clearly explains material throug repetition. Gave plenty of extra oppurtunity to better your grade.Thought she was great.",1
"Bertram is exactly what to expect if wanting to go to a university, JUST KEEP THAT IN MIND! I did not care for him! Once you figure out his tests and quizzes you will be fine. His tests consist of the types of cells, the physiology of how major concepts work,  and diseases associated with anatomy. HE GIVES Extra Credit that can bring up a letter!",1
Never miss class. Lots of notes..it was hard for me b/c I suck at math..lol,1
"She is a great lecturer, very knowledgeable in her field, and really cares about her students. She's very friendly and easy to talk to. This class was not difficult (no tests)  and was mostly about getting upperclassmen to become very comfortable with critically reading scientific literature",1
"Nice woman, but discusses things of little relevance to the subject matter. Helps brainstorm paper topics, which is beyond valuable for the papers, but most of the discussion section consisted of awkward silences as responses to useless questions. Add feminist elements in your paper to up your grade.",0
"Constantly rambles off on tangents during lectures. Many of her diagrams made things more confusing. Changed the entire format of the midterm the week of, and instead assigned it for over spring break. Totally inaccessible out of class, never responded to emails, often waited until lecture to answer very time sensitive questions. Easy class tho",0
"Take him over winter or summer and you will get to use cheat sheets. On those cheat sheets put all of your hw mngr problems and step by step how to do them. Learn to use your calculator. Tests are 1/2 homework type problems MC answer and 1/2 theory MC. Its not easy, but I like finance, I got an A, most people got C's. He doesnt explain that well.",1
"Only one thing you need to know. She writes down ""Daily Objectives"" (or hands out). SAVE THESE. As she goes through class, write the answers she defines in class for each daily objective. THEN for exams, she hands out a study guide that is LITERALLY compiled from the daily objectives. Match up your answers, memorize. Ace the test. Very simple.",1
He is possible one of the worst professors I've ever had. He is very bad at explaining topics and doesnt go over half of the clicker questions so its hard to catch up if you are behind. The only reason I go to his lectures is for clicker questions because I learn little from him. The class by itself isn't bad but do what you can to avoid having him,0
"It seemed like this was the first time she teached in a classroom, but obviously not, after reading everyone else's comments.  She was always at least 5-10 minutes late to class, unorganized, WAY too much work for an intro class, and she couldn't keep the non-interested students from bothering the ones that wanted to learn.",0
"Cupani is honestly one of the nicest people I have ever met, and she will never cease to surprise you. But, she reads the power points for her lectures and doesn't really teach the material. The only thing your grade comes from is tests. They are 15-20 questions with multiple parts, and if you miss one part, you get the whole thing wrong.",0
"Dr. Pringle taught the second half of the course, focusing on fungi, diversity of life, and plant life cycles and biomes. It was her first semester teaching any class. She can be quite out of touch with the students sometimes. The things she presents as interesting and hyped up just are not. She asks belittling questions that nobody responds to.",1
"Final exam essay is worth 40%. Apparently, my fall class only had to write a 1000 word essay. Other class have to write 4-5 500 word short essays. A lot of material in 8 weeks, esp online. He personally called me to help though with the final essay. Made me feel more confident. Lined up pretty well with History 1301.",1
He is just too hard. He gets off topic a lot and doesnt stay focused. When you go for help he is not really helpful at all.,0
Professor Burman was a very nice professor. But will be hard,1
"Professor Baumgartner went above and beyond for all his students in Anatomy 101. Be ready to pay close attention to his lectures. If you plan on not going, plan on failing. He works with you and for you. He's also a great lab instructor. I just wish he would teach 102 and 201 :( ",1
"She gives quizzes at least once a week. She expects you to read the book and know everything before she teaches. Shes a hard grader and when she says you just need to know the basics, she doesnt really mean it. Theres a lot of material in a short time. Shes strict about attendance and theres no such thing as makeup or late work.",1
"His class is pretty easy, but you could tell he's been told to lower the marks because their too high. So you have to be careful. Labs are pretty good too, alot of easy ones just sitting around waiting, so you'll enjoy that, just be careful with his tests now",1
"Really intelligent and knows what he's talking about. Nice and accessible. Study for days for his exam because it's not something you can cram for the night before and expect an A. His study guides help a lot. Take really good notes bc the only way to get an A is to pay attention to what he says, not what's on the slides. I recommend him!",1
Awesome professor. She was very helpful and always answered emails/questions quickly. There was a lot of extra credit so as long as you're handing in work on time it should be an easy A.,1
"Sara is one of the most amazing women that I've ever met! She is so passionate about what she is teaching and you can tell that she really cares about her students! If you have a little bit of background, you don't have to attend class to get a good grade but I found myself excited to go to class because her lectures so interesting.",1
"I really enjoyed his class and how he teaches. He's super friendly and will always help you if you ask for it. The only critique I have is that the tests are over ~5 chapters at a time, which is a lot of material to study. However, if you do the practice tests he provides and study, you should have no problem. I definitely recommend him.",1
"Excellent professor! His examples in class are straight from the text book. He is very funny also, however a little antisocial. Sometimes for his exams will give you something crazy that you have not seen before.  Easy grader.  He is always 5 - 10 minutes late to class and tries to make up the lost time by forcing the class to stay 5 minutes longer",1
Professor Cox makes Anthropology fun I was nervous going into this class having no knowledge of the subject but I was able to walk away with so much information and understanding of biological anthropology and the differences in the anthropology. If you are thinking of taking this class I recommend it but you will have to put the effort in.,1
"Very good prof.  Not an easy class, nor should it be; must think very critically and express it in your writing.  I worked hard and it paid off.  I'd recommend her.",1
She is a great person! I recommend her to anyone! she's really good at what she does and she will help you. She will put a smile on your face guaranteed! awesome lady great heart! She's very proud of her accomplishments; she's worked hard for her success :),1
She's fantastic!!!! She's always there to help with anything!,1
Honestly every review you read is correct. She was amazing both in person and online. She will give you good feedback and she tries to help as much as she can. Plus shes hilarious and sweet.,1
"Dr. Y. overlooked the physics labs when I took it. My lab section was stuck with an awful TA, Joanna. Everyone complained, but Dr. Y. insisted that it was us and not her. I got a D- in lab and a B+ in lecture. I have a high B average in physics 2 lab+lect. this yr. My grades prove I understand the material yet I was still blamed b/c of an awful TA.",0
"Overall a nice enough guy. Problem is his lectures are very dry, to say the least, and his grading mechanisms are quite flawed. You will more than likely be teaching yourself the material. The one good thing is what he teaches and gives in assignments is essentially the tests.",0
One of the best professors I have taken in a long time. He has a passion for Japanese and teaching. He's easy to understand and thanks to him I am quickly learning the language.,1
"Dr. Yamazaki is so far the most knowledgeable, interesting, and informative professor I have met. In her class,YOU WILL LEARN. Do not underestimate her class though, you have to write everything she says down, doesn't matter what, just write it down, trust, it will save you later. Exams and finals free response. If you want an A, study everything.",1
"Hands down, one of my favorite teachers here at SLU, even just as a grad student. He made class a conversation and was interested in what we have to say. Not an easy class but you get out what you put into it and Mr. S is more than willing to help you in any way possible. After having a terrible intro experience Mr. S made philosophy worthwhile",1
"Anne is one of the best professors I've had at Madison. She really listens and cares about your thoughts on the class and her teaching style. Our class ranged from Botany Grad students to non-science major Undergrads, and everyone still got a lot out of the course. I tell everyone I know to take this class",1
The best professor on campus,1
"She told me that college isnt for me and that I will never get a degree, all because I was habitually late by 5 minutes, which she considered to be absent for class. I work full time and was trying to get degree. She was very condescending and ruined my self esteem.",0
He is funny and full of energy.,1
Gives clear and real life examples to make the course simpler and relevant. Very approachable and nice. Got a question she'll take her time to break things down to make you understand.,1
"This class was awful. I hoped to learn more about forensics, since I'm in the field, but all he did was make us read stuff about the 'corrupt' forensic scientists. I learned nothing about forensics at all, just how some scientists have done poor work. Do not recommend AT ALL.",0
She is really funny and entertaining. Her test are hard but if you look over your notes you will be fine. She is reasonable and is willing to work with you. She makes a big class feel like a small one because she engages students and opens up the floor to here other peoples thoughts and opinions. i recommend her! :),1
"I am so happy I took Professor Wood. The book is a must , participation, doing your work, showing up to class, and communicate with Professor Wood. You will pass the class. I highly recommend her because she cares for her students, welcoming, and inspiring. You wont regret taking Professor Wood.",1
"best of a kind, book his class before full Marketing tactics Genius You'll Pass unless you yourself Screwup",1
Quizzes and exams are hard. All of the assignments are all rushed together. Most confusing class I have ever taken at UNA. ,0
This class is not terrible but his teaching style is so dry I have to drink a large coffee to stay awake most days. I recommend taking the online course but overall it is an easy A as long as you do well on the exams,0
"best in the soc dept, by far",1
He is a great teacher and such a friendly guy! He breaks everything down and it makes you feel like why am I taking 0700!,1
"He offers feedback on journal entries and short writing assignments. I dont know why I took this class, I hate writing essays. Also dont take him if youre in a different country but if youre east coast youre chilling. Idk why he made it mandatory to attend class but I just had my camera off and slept. Glad its finally over good freaking bye",1
The best prof I have had so far,1
"I took her for Writing for PR. very sweet, wants students to do well.  very approachable and friendly. class was a lot of work at first. Multiple assignments, and current event and GSP quizzes every class. quizzes were hard so later on she started letting us use the articles. She goes with the flow, but her expectations can be unclear at times.",1
aw. thinking back to this course i could cry. that class was so traumatic like destroyed my 4.0 and the one class i think is genuinely impossible to get an A in unless you live and breathe astronomy. It's sooooo bad you have to do like hours of reading then have a quiz every class that has nothing to do with the reading and he does not care,0
If english is not your best subject she's the teacher for you. You dont need to buy the book you can just look up all the stories online. You write three papers and she will give you an A if she sees you are trying. The class can sometimes get boring but its totally worth it!,1
His tests are tough but he is a good actually now prof.,1
"Great teacher, explains material clearly and has very do-able expectations for course work.",1
"all over the place, hard to follow, nothing makes sense. Nice lady",0
"Professor Bennett is very approachable, nice, accommodating to her students and is willing to change due dates on major assignments. Her classes mainly consist of group work, but she does let students choose their own group members. If you want to earn a good grade, do yourself the favor of keeping up with all of the canvas discussions.",1
"This guy knows how to teach. Always available for questions. You need to study to get good grades on tests, but he makes it easy. The schedule alternates between a day of new material and reviewing homework (or a test). He occasionally crams in more material than he should, but great overall. Really takes advantage of recorded and live classes.",1
"you have to put in the effort to do well in your class, but as long as she sees you are taking risks with your acting and trying, you can do well.  if you are the type who doesn't like uncertainty in grades you shouldn't take the class, because you won't find out your grades on the acting assnmts (only the written ones).  fun class.",1
"Dr. Tzacheva is very knowledgeable on the subject she's teaching. Lectures, unfortunately,are boring. She respects all students equally, though,and she does what she can to help with raising grades. A very nice lady overall.",1
acosta was an okay teacher but moves to fast,0
So sweet!,1
This class has been the worst class that Ive ever taken Prof tests on the concepts he barely spends time explaining throughly you are essentially on your own when it comes to tests. The labs are also bad he expects you to know all the lab material and literally comes into lab just to ask you questions and if you dont get them he roasts you.,0
"Ervin is a good guy, but this class is very challenging. I am an 'A/B' student in the business school but I got a 'C' in this course.  The homework is easy in the beginning but get harder as the semester continues.  I studied at least 24 hours for the final and still failed. Attend class, ask for help.",1
She favors reg. ed. students over special ed. students. She is a hard grader and can be rude and too rough with her comments on papers. I would find another instructor who is not so fake!,1
He is great! Super friendly and is very intelligent. You will learn a lot from him.,1
"This class is a lot of fun, but also hard work. You need to really pay attention and work hard on your assignments. Professor Kendall is super nice and very helpful with answering questions. The class is great and I would definitely take Professor Kendall again.",1
"sometimes too impulsive, expects student have a great interest in just his specialization of electrical. doesn't care much if you fail or pass; popular with his see you next year line. heavy on homework. Past questions will save your life, but try to know your stuff",0
"This is one of the worst professors at GWC. Taking Botany with him and it is SO easy, and not in a good way. He always wastes lecture time consistently by going on random tangents about irrelevant things. There's no organization or structure in this class and he does NOT put students first. Easy A but you will NOT be ready for other majors courses.",0
Awesome teacher.,1
"My GPA was a 4.0 until this class. This woman is ridiculous! I received a F for my milestone 3 for my final project. She said I needed to use parenthetical references which I used 8! One solution for bullying I used for the anti-bullying campaign and she said it doesn't tie in! Um, what?! If you are unlucky enough to get her, change that course!!!",0
"If you don't get an A in this class, you're doing it wrong. Incredibly easy. You will learn a LOT about Philadelphia politics and government. There's really no higher authority on Philadelphia politics than him, whether you liked him as mayor or didn't or aren't from Philly either way. Final exam is a city council budget simulation. NO PAPERS/TESTS",1
Professor Thomas-Reid is one of my favorite professors yet at App State. He does not give tests and we only had to write easy 250 word reflections throughout the semester. He is accessible outside of class and really cares for your education. He is always looking for ways to improve himself which shows what type of educator he strives to be.,1
RUN I YOU CARE FOR YOUR GPA. THIS CLASS IS FOR PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY L I K E PHILOSOPHY OR HUMANITIES. THIS PROFESSOR SHOULD NOT TEACH GED CLASSES!!!!!!!! HIS CLASS IS FOR A PHD STUDENT. HE THINKS HIS STUDENTS ONLY HAVE TIME TO READ FROM THE TEXTBOOK FOR HIS CLASS EVERY DAY. DO N O T TAKE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YOULL THANK ME LATER!,0
"Although many people consider Mrs. Fox's classes to be difficult, my opinion isn't that her class is difficult but instead that her classes are guaranteed learning environments. Starting on the first day, she lays out every detail of her class to the students. She has a strong syllabus that leads to success so long as the student does the work.",1
"Very easy class. A few easy assignments and a group project. You can only miss 2 classes of the semester. Scott is really funny and brings in good guest speakers. He made it easy to understand what nursing is really like and was accessible to ask any questions. Great guy, easy class!",1
"Professor Knott is a great teacher who cared about her students. She is energetic and loves to talk about the subjects she teaches. She assigns a lot of reading and requires a lot of interaction, so make sure you stay on top of everything. Professor Knott was very helpful to point out parts of my papers that I needed to work on. 9/10 recommend!",1
"This was his first semester at PSU Abi, and I really enjoyed his class. I thought it would be an easy Natural Sciences cred. You do have to work for it, and study, but its worth it. I believe we only had 3 exams, maybe 4, don't remember, and he helped you get ready for him. Aside from that, he's also super funny and easy to talk to. Cool guy",1
"Jenny is understanding of her students and really kind. The class itself is pretty easy, but it can get a bit boring especially when no one participates.",1
"Perkins is an awesome professor. I thought theology was going to SUCK, but I loved most of the readings. We watched movies and played video games as part of the class. Discussion-based class - there were only a couple of times we had lectures with notes. Very tough grader, but the class and his chill personality made it worth it.",1
"Hunt is a very boring professor. She gives very organized power points but reads in such a monotone voice. As far as being a teacher she is okay, but as a person she doesn't seem to care about her students. She has a lot of pride and looks down on her students. Her exams are also more difficult than other professors.",0
"One of the most humorous and interesting people I have met at ECC. His test material comes right out of the notes. As for a lecturer, he can get a little dry when talking about music, but is creative, charismatic and spontaneous enough to keep you involved. Overall: great teacher, great person.",1
"Lectures are 3 hours long, yes he is a bit boring and some topics are hard to sit through depending on your interest but it is very easy to do well in his course. He provides study guides that are 6-9 pages but if you go over it the exam will be easy since he pulls questions from the study guide. He also gives xtra credit 6% added to final grade.",1
I finished this class with 108%. Quiz and exam questions come straight from homework! Maybe numbers are changed. Lecture is super helpful and great explanations! All you do is examples and the material really sticks. Very good at explaining! Lots of extra credit opportunities. Quiz each week: 2 questions. Two midterms: 5-6 questions. No surprises,1
"Le cours est bien en général, il aime beaucoup parlé de son expérience, c'est sûr que défois c'est long, mais c'est quand même un cours de comptabilité...très satisfait en général!",1
Theres a lot of writing in this class that it can be overwhelming. You have about 2 days or so to complete a draft. Mandatory office hours. Expect to spend hours on this class. Lots of reading. Nothing impossible but tiring. Easy grade as long as you put in work. Hes chill and cares about his students. Most assignments will be marked complete.,1
Great thoughtful thorough. Wish I had her again.,1
"It's a hard class by nature of the material, not the professor. She's a working professional in the field so she definitely knows what she's talking about. Despite her busy schedule, she's always around for extra help if you need it. Tests were hard, but there were always EC options to help. Really sweet person and makes her expectations clear.",1
"TIME CONSUMING! Great class, love the teacher but you must pay attention and actually read to survive.",1
No Comments,1
"I don't know why so many people like him. he's terribly boring and ive learned nothing from him. bias towards one religion in my comparative religions class. rude to me and many other classmates. dont take this class, you'll fall asleep every time.",0
"Dr. MS is a great teacher. He knows how to teach and is very knowledgable. His tests are difficult but they are fair. There is about a 13% curve in his class, but depends on each class. Averages are in the 60s and the final avg was a 72%. Even if you are way below average you will end up with a C. Overall Fun and engaging teacher!",1
Among the best prof. I've ever had. Having access to Christos's brain in office hours is seriously priceless.,1
scariest teacher ever. Don't even bother asking questions because she makes you feel stupid for even asking them. Her course is extremely challenging and she doesn't let you go to the bathroom.,0
"He was really nice and there was no homework, only a quiz once a week and two exams and a final. He was really clear when teaching all the concepts and wanted the students to learn, didn't try to trick you on quizzes. If you study the lecture notes for the exams you will do well.",1
"ENG49 with Professor Gonzalez is an extremely fun class - his lighthearted manner combined with his extensive knowledge and care for his students makes this class one you won't want to miss. English is not my strong suit, but he is always available to discuss problem areas and gives great feedback on how to improve. I highly recommend him.",1
I haven't been to one online lecture and I'm passing. He literally sent an email that said please do not feel inclined to show up to class. You can take the quizzes and find the answers in the readings that he posts so easily. You also get two tries to take the quizzes. Easy class and i've never even heard the guy talk. Slight Gen ED to take.,1
"Lot of reading but it's all skim-able and very manageable for an English course. He explains things very well in lecture. Easy grader, and easy exams if you look over the slides beforehand. He was flexible when I had to take an exam early, reachable outside of class, and definitely entertaining! Highly recommend",1
She expects entirely too much for a 101 level class. Is not very helpful and makes the learning environment stressful as she constantly puts people on the spot.,0
"While he is very intelligent, if you are the type of learner who needs more explanation, he's not the professor you need. He explains the math problems by the book without further explanation. This course is fast paced and will not slow down for those who learn slower.",0
really hard class. lectures are irrelevant to midterms and final. midterms and final contain unseen problems,0
You will be suffocated by work and consider changing your major many times. She takes a while to warm up to but believe that she cares about you and the field of education which is why she gives you work and is tough. One of the most influential courses I've ever taken and Dr. Jones is an amazing educator,1
don't take her ever . she is not A PROFESSOR  i took her 240 with her last semester. i recommend you to drop her class if you register her class. Take another professor,0
gReaT teaCHer. sHe reaLLy kn0w heR fieLd.,1
"To anyone who sees this; take 322b off track with Dr. Thompson. He is the absolute best! His lectures are crystal clear- he explains everything and leaves no questions unanswered. I got a C+ in 322a but an A in his class. Go to lecture, do problem sets, go to his review session, ask questions, practice material and u will get an A.",1
"Even though his attendence is not mandatory I recommend going.  If you go, you will do better in the class.  He's a great teacher and grammar is hard.  He explains well.",1
"Professor was very unorganized. Syllabus was changed but not updated, so class didnt know when anything was due or what was expected of assignments because she changes them without notifying the class. Very hard to contact. Does not use e-mail often. Lots of reading, long lectures where she gets distracted and talks of everything but the material.",0
"A rough prof to take, wouldn't want to take class with him again, cynical.",0
"beckett was challenging and frustrating (maybe even useless), but hansen was a lot of fun. fair grader, workload was average, down to earth and accessible.",1
"I took Van Horn online. Very easy class and great professor. She is really understanding and wants everyone to succeed. There were 3 reader responses (400 words), 2 papers (1250-1800 words), and a final paper 1800-2000 words). I didn't buy either of the books and made an A.",1
"Dr. Crowley is an amazing chemistry teacher. This was my 2nd time taking Chem 2, and I felt 100 times better this go round, I actually understood the material! She went over every concept clearly and took time to make sure we understood before the test. Her set of notes are by far the best form of studyinglearning. Overall, best chem teacher!",1
Really kind and is open to helping students. Weekly readings and at home 2 question quizzes. Midterm and final are very clear and open note. Definitely a top choice for a teacher.,1
Great teacher and a great person. Cuts away the B.S. in the material to teach you what you really need to know. Tough class with a lot to learn and do but a great teacher. Seems sarcastic at first but cares about his students on a personal level. Tends to jump around from topic to topic in lecture. ,1
"if you aren't passionate about gender, get a different teacher. she will give you lower grades if you dont agree with her. she doesn't give exams or any homework except for essays, so if you dont do well, you're screwed.",0
"I loved professor kim! Not only does he care about the subject matter, but it's always amazing to learn from a professor who is passionate about what he teaches. Very kind. Graded by 2 papers, 1 midterm, discussion + final. A lot of reading but not hard to understand. Ended the quarter appreciating my cultural roots + history than before :)",1
"not sure why Professor Tavvs gets great reviews for his lectures.  He is a very sweet guy but his lectures were not for me.  If you see on his syllabus, his notes are very in depth with a lot of problems that are not necessary  (70+ pages).  Tavss does put in a lot of effort and do his practice probs! I Prefer Guerra or Kimmel.",0
Honestly the best math teacher I've ever taken. He's thorough and explains everything so well! Amazing teacher that truly cares!,1
"Dr. Labelle is a good teacher, very kind, involved with the class and gives good feedback. This class, however, is challenging. The class is all about running the Rethink Campaign; that's all that you'll be doing. So the entire class is like one big group project all semester long. But, Dr. LaBelle was very helpful and responsive throughout.",1
He does not grade tests fairly in my opinion and only rewards you marks if you follow HIS process despite many of the problems having two or more approaches,0
I never opened the textbook I bought. Lots of online homework. She was often very snippy with our class and the final was an assigned group project.,1
Would definitely take her for another English class.,1
"Charlotte is wicked smart and very engaging. I may not have loved every film we watched, but I still enjoyed her class tremendously - the workload was reasonable and her instruction was always stellar. I do wish she had led the discussions & flexed her Princeton PhD a little more though. Regardless, Gettysburg French Dept is lucky to have her !",1
"This the worst teacher ever.  She talks like she makes a lot of sense but unless you are a research expert, you will never understand what she is saying. If you ask too many questions in order to clarify her teachings, she gets upset and is either rude or disregards what you say. In the end she did grade on a cruve but the stress doesn't compensate",0
"Nice guy. Class is him doing practice problems from the tb. HW is through webassign. Tests mimic the tb/hw. Curved all of the tests. The curve is something like score*1.15 + 15. 1 test is dropped! 91 guarantees an A. Very easy if you're good at Math. I never went to class and got an A. Don't if you're bad at math, curve benefits the top.",1
"Tavss works at a faster pace than the other professors, but personally, I like  that he does that. It gives me time before the exam to review everything, instead of learning the material during the lecture prior to the exam! He has a great sense of humor, and will help you when you need it. Just pay attention and go to office hours, they help!!",1
"I took this class by mistake. The school signed me up for this coarse that i don't even need. He doesn't speak clearly, he is to fast, a lot of people dropped this Friday and Saturday class. He is not understanding at all, and he does not comprehend very well. He says mean things to students like oh well you don;t pass not my problem. Fire him!",0
"I can't express how much I love this prof. She is the most kind, sweet and caring individual I've ever met. She is super laid back, understanding and accommodation friendly. She gives such good feedback, and her assignments are super easy. You can find great study guides on quizlet, and she provides them. The textbook content isn't too hard either",1
"Professor Caramento, is very nice. He gives very good feedback when it comes to assignments. Would recommend his class if you are interested in African studies or if you need an elective. If you make the effort you will get a good grade in his class",1
"he cares a lot and will make sure you don't fail, lots of extra credit because it's a tough class. Lectures can be confusing. Don't need textbook. Good teacher.",1
horrible and very rude ! don't take any class with him,0
Great guy! He knows his stuff very well. I had no problems. He's always available to answer any question you might have. Great professor.,1
"Dr. McCabe is the best professor I've had at Bethel. He is insanely smart but very down to earth. You will never catch a ""holier-than-thou"" vibe from him. He gives insane amounts of homework (""good"" homework if that's possible) and is very challenging, but he is compassionate and not dogmatic. His classes are worth taking regardless of your major.",1
"One of the most caring professors I had. Wants her students to do well and is willing to work with you to get the grade you want. Exams, homework, and group projects make up the class. Be sure to show up she does take roll. Study guides for exams are given and homework is all in the book. Great class atmosphere and very approachable professor.",1
She can never be satisfied.,1
Jon has a lot of experience in this area. Also the class was service learning so we had good projects and Jon was able to help with the experience he has. It was a good class.,1
LONG exams! 150+ question exams. Yes he gives you the review a week before but the review itself is 200+ questions that you need to find the answers to and remember them. Unrealistic. Don't bother complaining he won't listen/care. Attendance is mandatory. You lose points for not coming to class. Jams 5 chapters in one test because he's unorganized.,0
"Professor Fetter is one of the worst professors I have had at Butler. He is a great person and a very enthusiastic teacher but does not efficiently provide students with the material and teaching skills necessary to do well in class. He records notes and puts them online, which are just as confusing. Do not take him or Marketing Analytics (MK 384).",0
"Great professor, the drafts help to get easy points and allow you to make a great final draft. She is clear on what she expects on every assignment. I took this online and it was great !",1
Jeri is an extremely fair grader and you dont need to be an artist in order to pass her class. She understands that everyone has different skill levels and as long as you try your hardest she will give you an A. Shes also extremely organized and accessible outside of class!,1
"First test in this class was easy, but the second test was a nightmare. Go to class and work through the practice exams he posts online. He doesn't post keys but if you work through them and bring questions to his office hours then he is very helpful.",1
"This guy is the easiest teacher to get along with.  He's simply a teenager stuck in a man's body, but he really knows his stuff so don't fret. (lol, it's a guitar joke)  If you have been playing guitar for more than 3 yrs then take lessons with him and not his other classes. Do yourself a favor and just have fun in his class/lesson. ROCK AND ROLL!",1
Definitely a difficult marker. By the end of the class however you will have learnt A LOT. Is reasonable. READ THE BOOK!,1
"Professor Hug is by far my favorite science professor I've had in the past 3 years. She made the material very straight forward and provided us with helpful analogies. Go to class even though it's not mandatory, sometimes there are extra credit assignments!",1
Professor alice is so caring and understanding she explains math promblems soo good. She is really sweet.,1
"She's a very nice professor. She post the slides presented in class on blackboard. Also, she invites guest speakers. These guest speakers always provide information that alters the way you think about a field in the CJS. Withal, she provide a few extra credit, one paper, a midterm, and a final. (She provides a study guide w/ all the information)",1
"Decided to take Pilates and am glad that I had her for a teacher! She keeps you motivated and even gives you small tasks to try to accomplish over the weekends. Her personality is bubbly and entertaining. She can have a militaristic style but in her own words ""its all out of love"". Ill take any class that woman teaches!",1
"Honestly the worst teacher I've ever had. Completely unclear on when things are due, or what. Instructions on canvas rarely make sense. Grades a basics class like we should all have a master's degree and 15 years experience in drafting. And just awkward and not enjoyable teacher. Would highly recommend not taking a class from him.",0
"This was a decent class, but I expected more. We were given two assignments during the year that were utterly pointless and felt like lower div busy work. There were also two papers and a final, pretty straight forward. Decent lectures, but very broad, and she really likes her terms so be prepared to memorize for the final.",1
"Lectures are long, does not explain material well. Does not give clear expectations. Answers emails fast. Book is useless, he provides a free pdf version.",0
worst teacher ever for online classes! her tests are impossible and she never responds to E-mails :(,0
"Really nice guy. Southern guy with a sense of humor. Go to class, he rewards the people that go. He can also be extremely approachable and genuinely cares about your performance in class as long as you care to show up and treat the guy with respect. Not an easy class but you can pass with an A if you just do the hw and take good notes.",1
Great professor! He thinks like a student and gives tips on how to study for his exams. Goes over many many examples and provides test practice!,1
"He was very helpful, very enthusiastic about Math, which makes the class interesting and fun. He gives a lot of take home quizzes that are sometimes harder than the exam questions. His exams cover a lot of material. He offers enough help when you seek for it.",1
So dedicated to students,1
Very difficult class.  Didn't help that he burned through the material.  Nice guy though.  Knew what he was doing.,0
This was the best online instructor Ive had to date. Mr Hebert is always available and answers questions no matter what time of day. I would recommend this teacher for all online classes.,1
"Dr. McKenzie is overrated. Everyone said to take one of his classes because they're ""fun"". This was a 100 level class but he treated it like a 400 level class and I had to teach myself everything from the book.",0
Amazing teacher! He is one of those teachers who knows exactly what he is talking about and is able to explain things thoroughly because of his knowledge.  Studying is not really needed because he explains everything in class. People say he doesnt help u on anything and he does but when they are dumb questions he lets u figure them out on ur own,1
"Fair class. Professor is friendly, but goes off on tangents occasionally. The unbearable part of the course is the material. Sometimes it's not very interesting and he will acknowledge this. No textbook use. 5 random attendances. 3 tests, drops lowest score. Final exam. Do the study guides! Questions are verbatim, you just have to find the answers.",1
"Fair professor. Make sure you actually practice Arena in your own time though or you're screwed. Keep up with the work he assigns, or you will be lost. Nice guy though. Takes attendance.",1
"Really delightful. Approachable, interested in your outcome, knows her stuff.",1
"Je l'ai eu à 2 reprises, à ma première et deuxième session, j'espère le retrouver pour ma 3ième. Un prof passionné, intéressant et humain. Il nous fait réellement aimer le français. Toujours souriant en plus !",1
Take him if you want an easy A!! He is pretty understanding + nice and not a stickler for due dates. If you are late you still have a chance to get a good grade. I had been late with a couple of assignments yet I still got full credit for them despite turning them in a few days past the due date. The book/Pearson lab part is expensive though.,1
"friendly and tries hard to entertain the class with pictures, but his notes are very disorganized and doesn't tell you which parts of his version arent in the 'student' version so unless you print them, try to sit with someone who does; relatively easy, nice to have all multiple choice with bonus questions and not cumulative",1
"Get ready for plenty of dad jokes. Not an easy A but it's far from impossible, participate in class and do the study guides.",1
"Good, organized professor.  He offers lecture notes that are only available in class.  There's practice exams available, to which he provides the answers.  These practice exams make up the majority of the lecture exams.  Lab is not complicated at all, but the lab exams require some studying.  Put in the time and you'll do good.",1
"If you do the readings and write the essays, you will likely do well, but not because of his teaching. He is often unprepared and goes on inconsequential and (often weirdly sexual) tangents that will not help you decipher the texts at all. You learn much more in discussion than class. Calls every female student ""dear"". Wouldn't recommend taking.",0
She is an awesome teacher will be taking all of her classes that I can. She's understanding the work is very clear and straight forward and she responds to all emails and questions,1
"While Professor Schlortt is very knowledgeable in his subject, this is by far the worst teacher I have ever had. He fails to communicate clearly outside of class. He fails to provide tools to help you succeed on quizzes and tests in a timely manner. He is antagonistic with his feedback. The list could go on forever, avoid this excuse of a teacher.",0
"Has weekly quizzes but they're fairly straight forward if you pay attention in class. Lectures had a lot of content, but exams were easier than expected. All of his classes have group projects (that I've taken at least). Old school teaching style, but very nice guy outside of class. Also none of his classes use textbooks.",1
"He is an amazing professor! Breaks down the material in a way that is extremely easy to understand. I tried taking ECO2023 online and it was a nightmare trying to teach myself, so I withdrew. I took Lenhart and made a 99 in the class. He does Connect HW, which helps boost your grade. Exams are clearly worded. Definitely take this class with him!",1
"There are quizzes every Thursday on the information you learned the week before. Everyone had trouble with the quiz timing and could hardly finish in time. There is homework for every chapter on the Pearson website, and sometimes there are problems that were never covered in the lecture. If you make a mistake on the quiz you will lose many points.",1
"All of these negative reviews are exaggerated. Yes, it's a difficult class, and he isn't the most ""warm and fuzzy"" guy. Nonetheless, he's very fair with his expectations and you learn A LOT. His priority is preparing you for the CPA exam, which is much more difficult than this course. If you put in the time you'll be fine; it's not rocket science.",1
"she's a cool person, but she tends to ask for too much from an ACA class. Like its a 1 credit class and she doesnt understand some people's circumstances. So i'll be a tough rater, like she's a tough grader.",0
"Alex is simply the best. He's a tough grader, but will go out of his way to help you and be there for you, and gives great feedback on papers. His class was the highlight of my semester and I wish he taught 205 so I could take him again.",1
"He is a really good teacher. It is important to attend his classes as his in-class examples end up on quizzes and tests. He does a really good job of explaining the concepts. His assessments are very difficult though. Short answers mostly. 5 quizzes, 2 mid-terms, final. He had a lot of homework but that was more to help you grasp concepts.",1
Dr Capper is by far the best teacher Southern Miss has. He is interesting and helps you really understand the material. I would highly recommend his class and this professor.,1
"The book was really helpful and interactive. His lectures basically repeat what you read the night before. DO YOUR HOMEWORK or you will not pass. Tests are difficult, but not impossible. Amazing professor and really makes sure you understand. iClicker required so show up. Mikes Bikes simulation is fun, but hard and you must remember to do it!",1
A person who knows what he is talking about and can answer any financial question given to him. He can push the envelope if he has the right class.,1
"The usual honestly. Not the best, not the worst. He definitely knows what he is talking about, and I enjoyed the one personal response we had (huge mark booster worth 10%), however, if you're someone who doesn't learn well from a textbook, or won't memorize things 100% as they're written, don't take his class.",1
"Man, his class was disappointing. He engaged the class pretty well at the beginning but lost it half way through. After the midterm, lectured continued but there wasn't a final exam... so his lectures were quite pointless. On the bright side, the work load was EASY for a 3rd year class, fewf.. He's not on blackboard, didn't like that. I would avoid",1
"Listen for nonart majors, this class will kill your GPA if you think oh that's an easy A. He's rude and tough grader. I took an upper-level painting class and got an A, this is a 1000 level class and he gave me a C?? this class makes no sense like is this even art ?He's too demanding someone needs to put him in his place cause it's 1000 level class",0
No Comments,0
Had a very negative experience with this professor. The class goes for the full 2.5 hours and is unbearably slow. Bases her teaching off slide shows and is VERY lecture heavy. The premise of the class is to build up skills and give a mock-lesson for the class. The professor basically verbally bashed us in-front of the whole class. Not proffessional,0
"Prof. Nielsen is amazing! She is kind, sweet and empathy! She always supports students!",1
Really easy class!! Tests are from hw problems so just put them on your cheat sheet (allowed). Really nice guy but soft voice. Take his class if you want a good grade!,1
"Putting tough grader isnt specific enough. Having a map quiz once a week is not a appropriate way to engage students and lecture slides that are so long the computer cant download them wasnt helpful either. When your average and median scores On everything are below 70% that is an issue with the structure of the course, not the students.",0
Wow what an amazing class. Not! The longest most boring thing youll ever do. This course is like watching paint dry and you get just about as much information from both. Professor Thompson shouldve retired 20 years ago. He will mumble on forever reading power points that have nothing to do with the actual tests. failure in action.,0
"Dr. Hansen is a wonderful professor who cares about his subject and teaches it in a clear, fun way. He gets to know each student. He gives his students lots of opportunities to get involved in hands-on learning, through field trips and soil labs and other ways. He is so, so kind. He is a very fair grader and very understanding.",1
"Everything week to week was the same so you can always know what to expect. Lots of reading but the work is easy if you actually do it.  The instructor however was not understanding at all. I had a few sudden unexpected things happen in my life (newborn in NICU, step-father died ) and he had no leniency and wouldn't even offer me a few extra days.",1
I completely disagree with the other review. Anne puts very little effort into this class. Tests come from a test bank of her previous tests. The TA is responsible for everything else. You could easily learn everything taught in this class from youtube. For a 4000 level class Anne is extremely patronizing . Don't waste your time.,0
"ONE OF THE BEST PROF IN SFU I EVER HAD. IT'S WORTH TO TAKE HIS CLASS. REALLY CARES ABOUT STUDENT, GIVE EXTRA HELP. ALTHOUGH THE CLASS IS NOT EASY, BUT YOU WILL SURVIVE AND ACTUALLY LEARN SOMETHING.",1
He is pretty easy grader and most projects aren't technically due until the end of the semester (I do not recommend starting them so late since you have 5 projects to do). His lecturers are a little boring and he uses a lot of old code that he sometimes needs to look at again to figure out what they do. His exams are pretty easy.,1
"Although she can be a bit unorganized and late to class, I truly enjoyed this course. If you take this class for honors, she will try her best to brainstorm ideas with you and find scales for your project.",1
Really cool guy. Have him for teacher and advisor and has always been very helpful in all aspects of learning. Cares less about memorizing stats formulas and focuses more on how it will help you in other classes. Definitely the best professor I've met so far.,1
"Great professor! she's very lively & makes learning Japanese fun. Attendance is mandatory, if you don't attend class your only hurting yourself",1
"Took him for film and lit.  This guy is the greatest professor at nassau.  I would take any of his classes.  Truly passionate, understanding, helpful, and inspiring. If you think I'm overduing it, then you haven't had a hellish experience with a professor yet.  This guy is the man. Pronounce his name ""Dongello"" and he will love you for it.",1
"I took him for online classes and I loved it! And when I was supposed to submit my final I couldn't get it to go thru, and he saved the day and helped me get it in on time!",1
Dr. Parker was great. Get him to tell you stories.,1
"You will never find a more caring, passionate, and professional teacher than Matt. He will do his absolute best to help you succeed. A truly rare breed of professor.",1
"Professor Thanajeyan's class is easier for those that have prior coding experience. For those without any coding experience, you will need to spend more time reading the book and paying attention during lectures. The labs are discussed in class and his final is based off of his lectures so it pays off to attend them. Also, do read the book.",1
"He's a good TA. Has a bit of an accent, but still easy to understand. You can ask him for help with the discussion worksheet so you should do fine in the course.",1
"The book is used for the test along with handouts. Multiple group projects with due dates around the same time. Wonderful learning experience. Just make sure you have the required elements in each paper, attend class, and participate and you will get an ""A."" WIU is lucky to have such a distinguished global educator.",1
"Dr. Batman makes University Physics super easy.  He explains things clearly, and he has the best dry sense of humor.  I would recommend always coming to class, but he gives you plenty of warning before tests, quizzes, and group problems. Oh, and he really is the Batman. So don't be a Joker. ",1
"Ive been doing great throughout the semester, but then he has had us study our two last assignments and study the answer key. The 50% midterm was based almost entirely on those two assignments. Frustrating that if i didn't understand something after doing well consistently i will suffer heavily for it.",0
"Extremely helpful, made learning the topics fun and easy. Loved her job which made learning the material a lot easier. Cared about her students and how they were all doing. Dropped a bunch of low grades and assignments.",1
"Prof Epstein is a nice guy and clearly smart, but has NO idea how to teach in a concise manner. His lectures were all over the place, he didn't hold office hours and was hard to get ahold of, and the material on the exams wasn't made clear beforehand. DO NOT take this class if you're just looking for distribution credit/not interested in ling",0
"Dr. Mark is excellent. I kept having technical issues and she allowed me to resubmit the assignments I lost, after the due dates! She gives short lecture videos, weekly quizzes, and group discussions, which can be difficult to organize. The exams are difficult because there is a time limit of 1 hour, with lots of questions, but they are open book.",1
"I worked really hard for a low grade. The class was insanely interesting. I was frusterated because no matter how much I memorized, visited her in her office, or spent on the readings, I couldn't figure out how to raise my grade.",1
I really enjoyed GEOL 100.  His exams are directly from his power points so if you take good notes you'll be fine! He gives three exams and lets you work in a group for the second half of class on them. There's a mandatory all-day field trip so expect to devote one of your Saturdays to that. I would highly recommend Dr. Boden!,1
"took this class in the 4week summer sesh & was working 2 jobs; that is the only reason I didn't above 92%. Dedicate 2.5ish hours/day to review & answer the practice problems, you will 100% get an A. Record the lectures and listen to them when reviewing notes. He doesn't ask any questions from book. Gives practice tests very similar to actual tests",1
"Esposito - charismatic, strange, and entertaining. Probably gets too far off-topic during tangents, but not a huge deal. Made an entry-level Greek civilization class interesting even for a junior-year statistics major.",1
He is an amazing teacher who makes it obvious he wants to see his students succeed.,1
"Dr. Kosnik was the best professor I have had in my college career so far.  His notes are clear and easy to understand and his lectures are humorous and engaging.  I miss his class.  Ee is awesome at piano and the organ.  Also, he is the cutest, nicest old man ever.  Dr. Kosnik is a boss.",1
"Great teacher. 4 unit tests 15-20 questions-review is the class before it, he does the review in class and it's exactly like the test just different numbers+if you complete it you get bonus points. 1 final of 30 quest no bonus points. No mid-term. Mymathlab HW due on the day of each test - easy!!! I suck at math but he makes it easy for you.",1
"LA is a super chill prof. I honestly did not go to many of the lectures because she posts the slides that do have most of the information she talks about already on them. 4 online quizzes, an essay on a Canadian criminal (interesting), and a final. You definitely need the textbook to do well on the quizzes! 100% would take LA's class again.",1
Very helpful and patient. I would highly recommend him esp in a face to face class.,1
He's great in helping and directing student to achieve great goals to every student. Great sense of HUMOUR....,1
"Hands down best professor at Blinn. I took this class to avoid taking biology/chemistry/physics and ended up maybe changing to an ag major! Pierce has much knowledge in this field, is very caring and guiding towards students, and doesn't make non ag students feel dumb when learning about new terms. Would 10000% recommend taking this science course!",1
"This man is engaging! Even online, he is an amazing teacher, I learned so much! He makes it easy to love the material; he doesn't use the book but provides the reading material; gives great feedback and gives clear assignments. He does online tutorials to help understand the midterm and final expectations. LOVE HIM- TAKE HIM!",1
"A conversation with Matt Anderson cures my depression and clears my skin. What an inspiring, encouraging teacher. God bless this man.",1
"12week DL spring 2019: I am not a huge reader & not big into history. Yes, theres hmwk. Expected. Everything is very clear and to the point. Do the work and you'll make an A/B. Hmwk/Test come from your book. No testing center required. Take test at home. Discussion board every other day per week-no wknds. Not that bad. EVERYTHING COMES FROM BOOK.",1
She is a great professor! you wont have to take notes as she already made work sheets available for her students that you simply fill out. this allows you to cover more material at a time and easy to come back to. She also records her zoom meetings so you can come back and watch previous lectures. Lots of extra credit too.,1
I enjoyed this class,1
He is a great professor and I have really enjoyed his lectures.,1
Lytle is an amazing human being as well as my favorite professor that I've EVER had; I highly recommend her. Just take her class for fun like I did and you'll see! Her class is where 50 min feels like 5 min.,1
"Her lectures are okay. She loves group work and you will do a lot of it in her class. She isnt a tough grader, but her quizzes might get you.",1
"Yifan Li is good as a person, but not so good as a teacher. I got a hard time to understand his leature, which is what the exams are based on. My english is not good, but I can understand all of my other classes. I couldn't take notes because I was not sure what he was talking about for most of time, and these notes can't be found anywhere else.",0
He is one of the best professors I have ever had. He is witty and funny as well as understanding. His lectures are actually interesting and he plays guitar for his classes sometimes.,1
"I took BIO203 with Professor Ba and he's an excellent professor that will give you the tools to study hard and his lectures are really worth paying attention to when the first exam is coming up. His exams require paying close attention to details and knowing and memorizing the answers, there is no room for cheating and skipping class.",1
Not a fan. Hartman doesn't really seem to care too much about her students unless you're a part of the English department. I've gotten attitude one too many times from her and I would not recommend her if you're a student who needs help outside of the class.,0
"Effective professor, so the material is easy to understand--seems boring, even. Don't let that fool you into not doing the practice problems, though--for an A, though, it is not enough to understand the material, you must also develop your ability to solve problems quickly and without error.",1
"Excellent course, excellent professor. The professor is very helpful and responds to all e-mails. Would absolutely take a class with Dr. Fredrickson again!",1
"she is a good professor, really specific and caring about her students. If you want to learn how to play piano and you have not taken any lesson before she will be really helpful. For those people that already play she will give a lot of work, not just playing but looking to achieve perception in your pieces. Highly Recommended!!!!!",1
"He's pretty redundant. Not much of a help, pretty much just a burned out bum.",0
Had her for both Writing 101 and 102 because she is very structured in assignments. Turn in work on time and participate and your grade will reflect it.,1
"never on time, frequently misses classes, not helpful, very angry person, at times she is irrational",0
Very clear on expectations- allows revisions to get a higher grade- very responsive to emails and provides a lot of help if you need it- is a lot of work if you take over the summer but can be done if you have good time management skills- 4 essays that are 40% of total grade- I definitely recommend Dr. Zbeida!,1
"Content of the class was incredible fascinating. He is not the most engaging lecturer, but the content alone had me interested. Not a very hard grader, and the class did not require that much work. Would definitely recommend if the content seems at all interesting.",1
I didn't think he was as bad as people say he gives worksheets which are helpful and will explain anything you need to over again for sure it's a tough class tho and he is strict but he's pretty good,1
"He gets very distracted by everything although he would be a good teacher if he could just stay on track. He also picks favorites quickly, and constantly starts conversations with them while teaching. However, he is very nice and understanding.",1
I have been lifting for years now and Ayland taught me so much that I never knew. I could not recommend taking his class more.,1
"Sachs was awesome and so was his Social Media class. This was the best 2 credit- 7 week course that could possibly be offered. Do the work every week. Simple assignments and quizzes each week. No need to get intimidated by the work, just don't procrastinate & you will be good.  Cheap books.  Answers e-mails fast & helps if you have a question. TAKE",1
I took dr. Brown for 0700 math and I am taking him again this fall for finite. He is a great teacher . He takes his time explaining and makes sure you grasp concepts the way your supposed to. He is very sweet and easy to talk to if you're having some problems or difficulties.,1
it was a good class really,1
No Comments,0
The term paper is heavy for the grade.  The syllabus was clear.  Weekly writing assignments for the grade is critical.,1
"Take this professor if you wan't to become any form of a writer or poet. If that is not you, avoid this guy's class. He does not care for any reason or excuse you may have for missing a class or doing something in a way he doesn't want done. I was one of 3 kids who passed with a C or better out of a class that began w 30-40 students. Good luck",0
Not good,0
"Very unprofessional and inappropriate at times.  Extremely laid back. Although, her adult lecture class is fairly easy. However, not a good instructor to learn from or gain experience with.",0
"Professor Nia C. Mahallati's Graduate Acquisition's Law Course covers Contract Law with an emphasis on the Sale of Goods. The course is very informative if you want a good foundation in Contracts Law as it relates to Services Related Contracts too. Great course, well informed professor, one of most useful and practical law courses.",1
The best online instructor I've had.  She is very engaged and in touch with the class.  Highly recommended.,1
"Prof. Smith made my first semester of nursing school a very enjoyable experience. She tells you everything you need to know for the tests, so record her lectures and print out the powerpoints. Also, shes absolutely hilarious. If youre in her class then relax because youre going to pass if you just pay attention. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND HER CLASS.",1
super sweet.,1
"Going into microeconomics, I did not have  clue on how interesting the subject at hand is.  She made the class very fun and used plenty of props to illustrate the concepts being taught.  Their are plenty of oppurtunities for extra credit as a result of a small 5-10 min. presentation on a case study we read about within the chapter reading. Pro A",1
"I swam for many years and took this for an easy pe credit. I like him because he swam for a good part of his life and keeps swimming, but is also very intelligent with every stroke and many, many drills. ",1
"This class is one where subjective grading is prevalent. A majority of the class is made up of discussions and participation grades, where no real grading rubric is available. Many times the professor would talk about topics very one sided that made some people openly feel uncomfortable. The class was not the best experience for me.",0
Don't take this class if you don't have to. You have a quiz at the beginning of every class on the chapter read in the book. The exams are difficult and hard to study for. The professor doesn't help much with teaching the material you basically have to learn it yourself.,0
"Excellent professor for both robotics and 170A. His exams are very theoretical, meaning memorizing homework questions will not yield a good grade (I think this is the reason for the negative reviews). Both corresponding lab sessions require many hours of work but were very interesting.",1
Extremely tough grader. When doing essays be aware of the rubric and follow directions carefully. No exams were taken but there were 3 presentations that count as big as an exam would. She is a very nice lady who cares for her students.,1
"Really doesn't care about teaching the course whatsoever. Told our class that half of us may become good engineers and the others would be outright bad ones. Doesn't really read emails for questions, instead responds with rude comments on how we should know certain things that he either hasn't explained yet or explained poorly in class.",0
"It's your required audit class for AC majors. All audit classes have the same tests and use the same material which designed like the CPA exam. Professor Dugas really cares about her students and wants them to succeed. She's easy to talk to and tries her best to make sure you learn what you need to the exams. She's the best, would recommend her!",1
no.,0
"Look, organic chemistry is hard. But MS is a solid choice. He is hilarious and tells stories in class which honestly helped me engage more and pay attention. Orgo is hard, but if you put in the work you will do well. Downside to his class is that tests ARE THE ONLY GRADE. There is a large curve though. I took him during COVID-19 and he was generous",1
"Professor Royce always made a point to understand and connect with his students, especially when Covid was mucking with everyone's life. His lectures were a little dull, but the course was easy enough that skimming through notes got you through. Beware that this course had a large portion of the grade on one semester long group project.",1
"Dr. Hauck is amazing! If you are taking genetics at Butler, definitely take Dr. Hauck.",1
"What an unbelievably disappointing class. She bases the entire course on class discussion, yet has us sit in lecture-style rows and talks for 75% of the ""discussion."" She's very easy, just don't come in hoping to learn anything like I did.",0
"Professor wider is a very fun and energetic professor, he expects his students to read material and quizzes are basically every class but is very easy. Gave 3 tests of multiple choice, true or false, and fill in. Cool professor definitely",1
she might be a little scatter brained but shes awesome! honestly if you show up for class and do your work you will pass the class. she does assign a good amount of work but its never that hard shes also open to extending dates to help her students out. i never once sat in her class and didn't laugh. she can be a tad bit irritating but she great!,1
"She is an amazing instructor, doing amazing things. She heads the Chemical Dependency Program at ELAC, which is a great program that allows for a Substance Abuse Counselor certification, if passed. Her psychology/addiction lectures are lively and interactive. She covers a lot of the material, though having a book is good. Take her class!",1
"shes great, smart, funny and very challenging.",1
Professor Lawson was definitely one of my favorite professors this semester ! He makes a 3 hour class go by super quickly with his hilarious anecdotes that relate to the lectures ! 10/10,1
"Super nice and understanding. Take good notes and study the night before the test and you'll be good. 10/10 would recommend her, easiest class ever.",1
Cant teach. Doesnt curve. Dont bother going to his office hour to fight for your grade. Wont give you a point back and will ask is this why u come to my office hour? Caring professor. Sarcastic. Doesnt care about your grade tho.,1
"Portfleet is such a nice professor and is hilarious! She goes on and on when she tells stories and always let my class out sooo early. She is so passionate about what she teaches, but I do not think I learned one thing in her class.",1
This professor was AMAZING! Best professor for business law! 3 tests and 4 group projects. She's very knowledgeable. I would take her over again!,1
Great Professor that you will learn a lot from especially if you are interested in a career in the medical field. I recommend her class to everyone. I got more out of this class than I did any other class I have taken while in my undergrad.,1
Excellent Professor! Gives very good feedback and amazing lectures. Dr Gueye is always willing to help students. Would definitely recommend him. ,1
"This class was great. He makes it sound like it will be really hard but as long as you do the homework and sometimes read the book, you'll be fine. There is a lot of homework and quizes every class period but it's all really easy. The only tests are the midterm and the final and there is a 2 page essay due at the end of the semester.Its really easy",1
"She assigns work daily to turn in the next class. She does not accept late work, nor does she grade on time. If you want to go the semester not knowing your grade by her or BB she's the one. This is a SELF LEARN COURSE!!!!! Only took the class because it was substitution for Stats II. Should have took my chances with Stats.",0
"After enrolling in Chem1A this semester I can honestly say I miss him. I learned a lot from him and his teaching style was easy to understand. He is a funny, cool, chill, and understanding guy willing to work with us. Gave LOTS of extra credit which saved my grade. His tests are kinda hard but he also gives study guides which are extremely helpful.",1
"Dr. Sarah La Belle's passion for ""research methods"" can take a toll on someone. Going to her class everyday was BEYOND the worst experience I have had in my very long time in academia. Do yourself a favor, do not take this class. There are other ways to fulfill the research methods cred (soc295 forsome). You will be saying, what is research method?",0
"All info is presented and you have 2 months before things are even due. No interaction until something is graded, and she grades on technicalities, not if you even understand the materials. She comes across really pretentious and condescending. Exam questions are based on YouTube videos. Honestly this class is hard to pass and I have a 4.0.",0
"Well lets put it this way. I got an A in the class. I didnt buy the book. I listened to her lectures and took some notes and thats about it. Just do the projects and put some effort into it. I never studied for tests but dont be fooled by that, just take notes during her lectures and you should be fine. Easy B/A :) Good teacher. Chill class, I advi",1
"Actually a pretty nice guy, obviously very intelligent.  Doesn't really cover test material in class, though, and you rely heavily on former tests that he posts.",1
She is a very tough grader and is super picky on papers. Her tests are dumb as well. Her teaching is dead boring and she is very mean. Avoid at all costs.,0
"His reviews before the test help immensely. He tries to get the class to participate and often would wait for a response which kinda wastes class time. He does not require much of you besides weekly responses and readings. So far, I like Brian Williams and his laid back teaching style. Unfortunately, no phones or laptop usage in his class.",1
"While his assignments are presented as difficult, he's actually an easy grader. Technically, everything he assigned I failed to meet the minimum but, he didn't care so long as I tried. Didn't really learn anything but I did get an A. So, there's that.",0
"My favorite professor at BU. Really does want you to learn and improve, and can be a bit harsh at times, but he's a really funny guy. Allows you to have rewrites! Knows that 3 hours is a long class but he makes it bearable.",1
"Kristi is very friendly but she sucks at replying to emails, she grades everything months later. Is confusing when explaining the papers she assigns. Exams are ridiculously difficult would not take again.",0
"Horrible professor, so rude and reads straight from power points, doesn't actually teach. Tests are confusing. Read the anatomy textbook because it's your only chance of passing.",0
She is very harsh and a tough grader. Don't be humiliated. She has a lot of expectations. Doesn't give proper instructions. Horrible professor.,0
"Easy class! Do the study guides using her lecture notes that she posts on Angel and you will Ace every test! Shes also pretty funny but lectures do get boring at times. Shes strict about attendance and due dates but as long as you do the assignments, and on time, you get the credit.",1
This professor grades as if literature is your major. I took his summer class and his expectations were too high for the time allotted for our assignments. He expects you to know the depth of what has taken him over 5 years to be familiar with. ,1
Very nice guy. But worst math teacher I have ever had. If you don't show up you will not pass. There are no video lectures so if you miss class then you don't know what we did on that day. If you are not confident in math then do not take this class. He doesn't explain the material clearly at all and if you ask questions he gets annoyed.,0
"A great teacher who really knows what she's talking about. She's really intense if you don't put in any effort, is even more intense if you do. She really wants you to pass AND learn German so don't take her class unless you want to LEARN. She's also funny and quite attractive...",1
"Ms. Mahon is nothing but amazing. She is the instructor we all need to get through this difficult course. Shes knowledgeable, caring, strict, and still able to demonstrates empathy. Ms Mahon genuinely wants to see her students pass and she gives you everything you need to do so. She my top recommendation",1
Alynn was a wonderful professor for KIN 150! She was very enthusiastic in her teaching and willing to help students individually outside of class time. She marked the final sequences very fairly and gave you good marks if she knew you were putting the effort in. I would highly recommend her class to anyone! (and she's really pretty),1
"Really easy online class, if you do the work on time there will not be a problem.",1
"Her class has very long boring lectures. She just reads everything off the board. She is a tough grader. She makes you feel stupid for asking a question in class.  I finished the class with an  89 and I regularly attended class, did every assignment  and did EVERY extra credit assignment and she still didn't bump me up.",0
"Doesn't post note, so you must attend. Class was very interesting. Very knowledgeable, very nice, and very generous. She told us what possible/actual essay questions we would need to answer for the midterm and final. Really easy to write up your essay before hand, memorize it, and then regurgitate it. You still have to write a good one, but easier.",1
"When she said the class is an accelerating class, she obviously wasn't joking. Although her class is not easy, it's not hard either. As long as you follow her instruction, you'll easily pass the class. She's extremely helpful and nice.",1
"280 with Nelson is the best class I've ever taken at Davidson. People think he's scary, but he's not; you just have to actually speak up and he'll notice you fine. LECTURES ARE AMAZING, challenged my ideas on life, not just on literature. Do yourself a favor, and take a Nelson class.",1
"Dr. Huerta is one of the most genuine and kind professors I know. She is so caring and flexible for her students, and really makes them her priority. Dr. Huerta is so engaged in her lectures, and really makes it a fun and interesting class. I would definitely recommend Dr. Huerta as a professor for any of the classes she teaches!",1
"Professor Hansen is one of my favorite professors of all time. He's brilliant, incredibly engaging, and very funny. I always looked forward to his lectures. Hansen does a great job at clearing up material that may otherwise be incredibly pedantic. The only downside/inconvenience is that he is very slow at handing back graded material.",1
"Really math-focused course that can get a bit dry, but it's easy to understand it's applications as you go through. Exams usually have one really advanced problem that we didn't go over, but everything else is fine. Projects are always one big problem we didn't go over but it's still manageable. Also he's really funny despite what anyone else says.",1
You do not have to show up at all and you can still get an A. Do the online assignments (which he grades easily) and use his study guide for the midterm and final and you will be fine.,1
"She's one of those people who thinks being ridiculously hard and assigning tons of work makes you a good teacher. The day a 7 page research paper was due, she told us we had a take home essay as part of final due in 3 days. Are you kidding me? Also, tons of reading each day. And she definitely plays favorites.",1
Very fun teacher. Very knowledgable about computers and very entertaining. Provides study guides that makes passing the tests much easier.,1
"Gives opportunity for extra credit relating to the class throughout the semester. Fair grader, and if you are having difficulty in any of the projects or material, he will take the time to explain more.",1
I love her ,1
"Not very well prepared for class.  We spent most of the class time waiting on him to get his stuff ready and the rest of it talking about things that didn't apply to anything remotely related to the course material.  Tests somewhat difficult, but not too bad.",0
"Took him during summer semester. There was a lot of readings, fill in the blank questions after reading chapter, assignments to make you understand what you learned. Wasn't tough on us. He did tell my class that he would usually have students take oral exams but luckily we didn't have them, could be different. Overall nice guy, expects a lot from u",1
"Crazy guy, sooooo funny! He is out there but his jokes are funny and keep me tuned in. Pretty easy teacher, just do the work. He is a fun guy. Very scatter-brained!",1
"doesn't just teach you facts, teaches you how to think, challenges you as a student. The best teacher at Coventry. Should be a Prof!",1
Dr. Konen is a real inspiration to environmental science nerds like me. He teaches you so much information simply through his power points. All of the notes you need are online (blackboard or whatever system NIU uses in the future) and so are the study guides. PLEASE do the study guides- they are exactly what the exams are about. Minimal homework.,1
Chris was awesome! He is so caring and talks about issues that MATTER even if they are controversial. He's the kind of professor that doesn't make u feel dumb if you have the wring answer. He has a clear method on what works n what doesn't for students i really wish he was teaching 103 this summer. He's my favorite english professor at FC!,1
"Idk why her ratings are so low but trust me when I say she's amazing. She explains things rlly well, and rlly cares about her students. Responds to emails, and helps u whenever u need it. She is a tough grader but she gives you good feedback on drafts so u can get good grades. If you'll put in the work then you'll be fine. Take her she's amazing!!",1
"5 questions quizzes every class bout assigned reading, sounds easy right? Wrong. Questions always consist of the most trivial parts of reading! Tests are multiple choice, but don't let that fool you! They are still extremely difficult! The course material is challenging to say the least and his ;lectures do not clarify anything! Also talks too fast",0
I took 2 Real Estate classes with Professor Lawson. Weekly discussions were interesting and helped to learn the material. I highly recommend his classes.,1
"Prof. Zbeida was one of my all time favorite college professors. I always got amazing feedback that was critical but never rude. She helped me improve my writing skills greatly. 10/10 would reccomend her course. There are many reserach papers and lots of quizzes, but every topic is interesting and the quizzes are very helpful.",1
Mr Tavss is the best grandpa!!!! The best teacher ever .,1
"Art 1910: Keep up with her calendar and do not miss quizzes or photo assignments. She co-taught with Kristina Smith who used sarcasm towards students and talked down to them. I really liked Professor Wells teaching. Overall, good class.",1
(part 4) Pros(3): The final exam is non-cumulative. But the algae identification is cumulative.  Cons(5): He doesn't give any curves for the exam. He thinks giving the sample exam is a form of curve and he believes he is doing the fair thing eventhough many of those questions are a PITA.,1
"I took 240 online with Dodson. I do NOT agree it was an easy A, but participating in discussion boards helps A LOT. Course material as it progresses gets tougher, but Dodson is a great resource. She's available by Email or discussion boards to help. Would take her class again. I was nervous after being out of school 10+ years but she was great!",1
"Don't take her, If your a good student. The best you can expect to get is a B or C. She has ridiculous styles when it comes to writing, and if you don't do it her way, she'll sure tell you. Your first paper she won't even read it. She'll Just tell you its not an A paper and prob give you a 80%. She doesn't like male students (Guys don't take her)",0
"If you struggle with math, don't take her. She isn't helpful and makes it even more difficult. Can be condescending and treats students like children. The book is something that she and other instructor put together. There isn't much there to help you learn material. Strong accent and difficult to understand.",0
"This teacher is amazing, if you struggle with math especially in an online environment she is always more then willing to help and make sure you succeed. She really wants you to be able to get something out of her class so as long as you reach out she will help you.",1
"Wouldnt suggest him. Very absent minded and unprepared for class. Also pretty unclear about what he expects for case studies and other projects, which makes the class way more challenging than necessary",0
"His lectures are really boring because he just reads straight from the slides, but the class is extremely easy!! don't listen to bad reviews on here. theres 3 quizzes that are straight from the textbook and 1 take home test. this class is an easy A!!",1
Very nice professor. Always ready to help. I took an online class and never felt like that I am in an online class. Always ready to meet you and very fast in replying emails. I would love to take class with him again and again.,1
"He is my favorite math professor. He stops if there is a question, it makes covering the material go a little slower but is well worth it to help everyone understand the material. He offers his lecture notes online so you can print them out and write on them in class, this was VERY helpful to me.",1
"Absolutely terrible. Gives little help on the massive amount of daily homework. Little explanation over topics expected to know without prior discussion. When he does answer a question is extremely condescending. On more than one occasion said ""If you don't understand this then drop the class."" Has knowledge of Spanish but doesn't wish to share it.",0
"makes a lot of unfunny jokes which come off as mean especially to students, goes off tangent often in lectures, feedback isn't helpful, readings assigned are difficult to write on for his expectations on essays,",0
"One of the nicest professors I've had but not the easiest A. If you do all the past exams and make a solid note sheet though, you'll be fine. I didn't really study the powerpoints much. Try to take the class after gen chem so those concepts are fresh in your mind. Also a lot of grade buffers with clickers, quizzes etc..",1
"Great lecture style, but does not post notes online, so you need to be in class to get content. Assignment instructions and feedback can be very vague, but will clarify when asked to. Exams are not difficult, but can be tough in grading assignments. She is different, but not a bad teacher. I've taken her twice and would take again.",1
"This class is supposed to be an easy A because no one cares about classics, we only do it for requirements. Lectures are like watching paint dry, some of the TFs are hardos and dont let you go on your phone, youll get points docked on your assignments for arbitrary reasons. Theres a lot of extra credit though and and that can save you from an A-",0
"This professor is absolutely terrible. She is always late to class and never has a lesson plan. She just starts talking and expects the class to keep the conversation going, even though no one knows what she's talking about. The work for this class is excessive. If you have any other options for professors, I urge you, don't take professor Hart!",0
Not exactly sure why Bushey gets poor ratings? Chem isn't for everyone so rating him poorly because you didn't understand the material is unfair. Bushey's class is straight forward and organized. All the lecture notes are online ahead of time and all of his quizzes and tests follow the notes perfectly. He does a lot of practice in class as well.,1
"God bless this teacher. She lives a very hectic life and has so many responsibilities on her plate. Obviously, she doesn't have time to organize and is very messy even for her honors class. However, she is a great professor and I will her the absolute best.",1
"Very entertaining, like said before he has lame jokes but are funny in the back of my head. He makes everything so clear and explains everything by step which some people might think as a waste of time but it really helps to just soak in harder steps.",1
Easy A if you read the book and pay attention to his lectures,1
"Stop her and ask her questions, she will help you. She allowed people who took her online class to visit the class and vice versa if you missed a day in class. She was telling me she did have exams emailed to her but it was more of a hassle then asking people to come in to class to take the exam. tho i agree online should stay online. Nice teacher.",1
"I have never had a professor give such meaningful and INCREDIBLY quick responses to my homework and assignments. You are such a responsible professor, and I appreciate feeling like my college dollars were well spent. It was a lot of work, but I actually learned a LOT in the class. Thank you Jonathon.",1
"I think Mr Bannow means well, but he is not very helpful if you have a question. He horrible at explaining concepts at a basic level and gets defensive and angry if you don't understand. I have learned to just figure things out on my own once I get home! Do not recommend his class, unfortunately he is the only option at the downtown campus!! ",0
"GENUINE TEACHER! He gives 110 percent, motivates you to succeed and makes things simple to understand. Requires active participation with the reward of actually learning and accomplishing your goal.",1
"She was very helpful throughout the semester. As long as you do the reading and homework, you will be set for the oral quizzes. The in class essays come right from notes taken in class a few days prior. The best professor I have had at Shepherd",1
"All he does is read off powerpoints and show youtube videos. He's a nice guy and means no harm, but he's just not a good teacher. He allows a cheat sheet for tests, and has all homework and quizzes online so your grade can't be that bad. But I wouldn't recommend to most people",0
Great teacher. Makes class interesting. Helps everyone succeed. Need more teachers like him!,1
"AMAZING  teacher, very helpful, unfold the material in an excellent way, understanding and always there for his students! I took him last semester for intro Sociology and so far no teacher excel like him + he made me love the class so much !",1
Go to class on presentation days. Super easy class. He is annoying and has a bad attitude towards things he disagrees with. You will have to do module online but I got it done in the free 2 weeks of having it so I saved $100 bucks. EASY CLASS.,1
He is so boring and scatterbrained he makes his tests harder than they need to be and claims that you have to read the textbook 5 times in order to get a B he doesnt teach and is kind of ignorant and thinks that no one studies and has no sympathy for people. He is super confusing and his tests suck.,0
"Took her for sociology and gender sociology. Amazing professor, her classes are very interesting! She has a unique grading policy,  you do have homework and short online reading/quizzes/surveys which help your grade A LOT!  Even if you are bad test taker, other things can fix your grade! Very approachable. Not an easy A though, effort needed!",1
Eddy is one of the most caring instructors that Ive ever had. He encourages creativity and is willing to teach you whatever you want to know about fabrication and engraving.,1
"Sullivan is a great professor to learn from. He has had first hand experience in the field, and can provide great insight on his lectures. ",1
"She promised practise questions for Imin, delayed them week after week and then never gave em. Inconsistent",0
"I enjoyed this class. She told a lot of stories and never really got to the point with most of them, but she was funny at times. Her tests were really fair and came pretty much straight from her notes. Study the notes and you should be fine.",1
No Comments,1
"She has made a well-designed course, easy to follow. You do need to have good computer skills, but she gives good feedback. Learned a lot.",1
"he is very good at lecturing and is clear with what he expects from his students. however, he does not give extra credit but is good at his job",1
"READ THE CHAPTERS!  her lectures are heavy from the book.  She is big on punctuality, so show up on time and be ready when the class starts.  if you show up after attendance, you are absent.  The exams were a bit of a struggle, as there is a ton of info covered.  She gives plenty of extra credit.  the speeches are given with loads of time to prep",1
Really enjoyed her class! I would take it again just cause its so interesting.,1
Andor is one of the best professors I've ever had. I have him for 3 of my classes and I am constantly excited to attend and learn from him. Take any class you can with him!,1
"She is a very nice teacher, does not put up with rude behavior. Her class was tough, I personally do not recommend her. Majority of the class failed, go to main campus more options. She makes you work in groups a lot. Try your best to keep up and get your book as soon as possible. Midterm  take home, Final  take home or in class(less questions)",0
Sitting through this class is utterly painful. He gives you a syllabus but rarely sticks to it. He makes you buy a textbook you barely use b/c you need to get 3 course materials packets (that he uses). He teaches the same idea abut 10 times and then moves onto another one. I have no clue what the final will even test on,0
"Dr. Pave is very structured and organized which I like. I took his class for a 5week summer course, so it was heavy. Initially it was overwhelming reading his syllabus. However, he does seem like he really cares about his students. He is active on Canvas, posting weekly. He is prompt to respond to emails. Do the work and you should pass.",1
Loved taking class from her! Would definitely take a class from her again if possible,1
"Dr. Heske is really funny and ALWAYS in a good mood. He is more than willing to help his students, and he knows what he is doing. He tries to keep the class interested in the topic at hand, and tests are based off homework questions so if listen very closely in class, read the book, do the sample problems at the end of the chapter, you will get an",1
Quite boring..strong accent.semi-lenient with grading..unclear in lecture.he is nice though.,0
"Very odd grading scale, grades off what she thinks is right instead of using the correct rubric",0
"She is my favorite professor here at Allegheny. I respect her a lot, and I think she grades fairly. Her class is my favorite of the semester, and one of the few that I've ever had that I actually really look forward to attending.",1
"Awesome professor! I highly recommend taking Dr. K, he is very knowledgeable in microbiology and does his best to get you to understand the content. He made the class fun. Follow his instructions and you will pass, very simple.",1
Great professor. Very helpful when you don't understand something. Made class interesting with activities and hands on assignments. We did lots outside of the classroom which was helpful for learning about the environment.,1
"Kosnik is extremely enthusiastic, loves what he does, and enjoys jamming on the piano. Pretty easy A as long as you go to class, pay attention, and do the reading. You have to go go a few concerts and write reviews on them, but it's very easy and there's a chance for extra credit.",1
"Professor Knapp is a great online teacher. He lays everything out for you, you just have to follow the instructions. You have to read and do the work to get an A, but he lets you do all of the homework all at once if you want. If you work ahead like he says, the class is a breeze. I did my homework up to the quiz once every few weeks.",1
"I had him as a discussion class for calc 1 and my god he seems so irritated to teach. As if it's not his job to??? Also, he graded my work with really rude comments. I attended his discussion once and I asked a question and he seemed super annoyed that I did. Never joined the class again.",0
This class was horrible. She grades on however she wants and doesn't give back any comments. Her scantron tests are not even covered in the book.,0
"TLS 356 was a very informative class. I really enjoyed the content of the course. There a lot of little papers, but they're no longer than 400 words which isn't bad. He does daily participation, so I suggest going to class. There are also quizzes almost every week, but most of the articles can be found online, so you don't really need to read it..",1
She was the best teacher ever. She is very kind and if we ask her a question she will definitely answer your questions very clearly. She will have homework passes to get extra credits,1
The class is pretty easy. In class labs are given once or twice a week and are worth 10 to 20 points. Dr. Liu is actually really funny and basically tells you what questions will be on the exam.,1
Stay away if you want to pass,0
Shes easy and sweet! If you stay after she'll help you! She gives out the questions on all your tests so its no prob! Shes laid back but you still learn. Great class!..esp as an elective!,1
Professor Warn was the best professor that I had during my first semester of college. You could tell that he really cared about what he was teaching and he always knew his stuff. He used personal stories to relate to everything we were learning in class and it was extremely helpful and entertaining. I learned a lot and would take it again.,1
"Asynchronous, does review once a week of the chapter we read(optional). Weekly quizzes (pre quiz & post lecture quiz) on Cengage. 2 midterms & 1 final, really hard tests. Professors accent is hard to understand.",1
Professor Heyborne is the man! His class was tough but manageable. He took time to explain difficult concepts and really made lectures interesting.  He cares about his students success. I have seen him several times on campus after taking this class and he still knows my name a year later. One of the best here at SUU.,1
Professor Wiley is a awesome teacher but makes you work for your grade.,1
"Took SOC-201 (which is an intro class) spring 2017 semester and Prof. Wood was always clear with lecture, always organized and ALWAYS provided feedback when ever needed. I would most defiantly consider taking another one of  Prof. Woods classes. 10/10.",1
"Grading criteria was not clear. Gives extra credit, but she won't post it online. So, it is hard to tell if she's really applying them to your grade.  Not very helpful. When explaining something, it was confusing.",0
She is nice and respectful,1
"Professor royce is amazing , he teaches everything which i upto trend that will definitely be useful for a professional career.",1
"One of the best teachers at Evangel! Dude is tough, but he cares about your learning and about you. I went to him many times with personal issues-- even on holiday breaks. He is awesome!",1
"here are some my experiences with her: 1. She has an accent however, she is understandable 2. she goes into a lot of detail into topics 3. she does not give reviews to exams. but she does provide review topics on blackboard. 4. notes on board is unorganized 5. no extra credit work 5. exams are difficult. 6. no hw decent professor. Just pay attn",1
Probably wont get an A but he's a great lecturer and interesting person,1
"never on time, sometime strays off into a rant.  easy to get along with, helpful, lets you express your thoughts, caring, knows his stuff.  not like any other professor i've had, cool dude.",1
Gives good lectures but very opinionated and doesn't really open her mind to student's perspectives. Memorize her opinions on topics in order to do well in the class and on the exams. She is kinda rude and detached from students. She is also a really tough grader and multiple people in my class including myself said she didn't grade fairly.,0
Best ever his life experiences and acedemic successes bring much to the class,1
great teacher!! she is always willing to help students through any difficulty. She is extremely nice and really know chemistry very well.,1
"She was one of the easiest professors I've had so far. Once you know her opinions on the topics of the class (she makes them very clear in lecture) it's really easy to know what to write in your papers to get good grades on them. She can be pretentious, and the lectures are really boring, but always show up, attendance is a big part of your grade.",1
"READING is a MUST! Don't wait til the last minute to cram stuff. No multiple choice tests, but essays, matchingidentification, maps, etc. Expect pop quizzes & short writing assignments. Read his instructions very carefully. No D2L slides, so take notes. Awesome teacher! Engaging. I learned a ton. I'd take another one of his classes in a heartbeat.",1
DO NOT TAKE HIM!! I took the 8 week online class and asked for help with the Excel project and got no response. I emailed him 4 times and got a response that did not explain anything. Way more than just the usual computer stuff. I get all A's in my classes but will be lucky to get a C.,0
"This professor is tough and makes you work hard for your grade. BUT he is extremely knowledgable about Sociology. He is always willing to work with his students!! Very caring. I took this class online in the summer and it was discussion boards and 3 exams. Definitely took time and energy, but worth the outcome.",1
No word can describe his class. You have to understand mumble and polish accent to know what hes talking about. I dont think he even knows what he's talking about. He speaks the same language as DESIIGNER except monotone and every now and than a moan.,0
"he is hilarious. he is always happy too, that makes it easier",1
professor logue is the best ever,1
Really enjoyed the class. Great Professor,1
"Horrific. She gave us a quiz one day after syllabus day that was extremely specific and difficult. She is not helpful and her teaching method of having students read and learn the material themselves through a dull and non-interactive textbook before each class seems counterintuitive. A professor's job is to teach students, not watch them struggle.",0
"She is definitely one of my favorite english teachers. If you do the work, you are guaranteed to pass, and if you put in some effort, you'll end up with an amazing grade. She is always available to help and truly cares about your success.",1
"This guy was awsome. At first you might seem lost but as long as you read, youl'll be fine. Tell's you whats going to be on every test and handed out NO homework. Just reading! Very interesting and makes class fun. Took him at SCC so I was lucky but if you get a chance, Take his class.",1
"I had Ning for college phys 1, PHYS 1211 and PHYS 1221.  I got a B in the first two and an A so far in 1221.  Although he has a chinese accent, and is somewhat unclear during lectures he does give a daily worksheet and has powerpoints on D2L.  If you study both you will ace the exam.  Make a good notecard with formulas and ADD UNITS OF EVERYTHING!!",1
"I don't recommend taking her online course. There was quite a bit of reading, but that is to be expected. Ridiculous time limits on exams/quizzes, NO feedback, and turn around time for grades (semester is over and I still haven't received grades for 2 papers- be prepared to wait 8-10 weeks). DON'T. DO. IT.",0
"Espo was a great professor. He is very intimidating at first, and you will feel like dropping out in the beginning. However, the hw and tests are very concise, and if you do the work and reading the class is great. He is very engaging and I really learned a lot. He gives A LOT of extra credit.",1
I love this man with all my heart,1
"People seem to either like her or hate her. I really liked her. Her quizzes do contain grammar mistakes which can make answering them a little confusing once in a while, beware of that. Otherwise, she is very nice, very understanding. Asides from the grammar, she is very clear and very willing to help. There's no surprises with her.",1
"He's a very interesting professor. There are professors who may teach a bit better, but Dr. Anikovskiy makes the material so interesting and is super helpful if you ask or email him questions. He released all his notes before the final exam, which really helped. Would definitely give him a 5 if he made slides for his entire part of the course!",1
THIS class was absolutely amazing. He gave you multiple chances to redo papers when you didnt recieve the grade you thought you deserved. He makes you think and opens your mind to so many things you never thought about. He really explains things extremely well. This class is the highlight of my week!,1
"Decent teacher, but he was not understanding at all when I had a severe case of the flu and had to go to the ER on the day of a test. A doctors note from the ER was not enough for him to allow me to retake this exam. I spoke with the dean on this matter and applied for a grade appeal. I highly advise everyone against taking this class with Knox.",0
"I attended Prof. Ross' class in 1994 and I have never been as engaged, reflective and verbal in class. He is simply the best teacher I've had and our discussions continued on train 4 downtown after classes. Since then I've taught and become a professor myself, but I'm nothing like Prof. Ross in class. I wish to thank him and recommend him.",1
"The only bad thing is he didnt follow the syllabus really, so I was confused most of the time about what homework was due and when. However, he really is a great teacher, he likes to joke around with students and ensure that everyone knows the content. Pay attention/participate in class, dont have your phone out and youll be fine.",1
Professor Carr's class was enjoyable and engaging. He cares about the students and what is happening in their lives. The online tests are easy but lookout for the in class quizzes. You have to study and memorize the terms to do well on the quizzes. The group project is interesting but hard to coordinate schedules with part-time students.,1
"Dr. Cutler means well, but if you get offended easily then beware. She is the type of professor where if you're good in her class, she'll be very nice to you and you'll have no issues. If you aren't so good in your class, she's really rude to you and makes you feel like you're the worst person in the world.",1
"Like the last comment said, take a SL class that is five units so that you will not have to take another upper division GE requirement. This class is a waste of time. Only her political view matters and that is what you will be graded on. Another student argued with her and she had the audacity to email us calling us complainers. Good luck.",0
"Took professor Nelson on a 6week period for PSY230, best decision ever! She was very sweet and definitely wants you to pass! She is understanding and will answer your emails if you have any questions. 6week summer courses are very fast but she made it so it was not overwhelming! I love how organized she is. Would definitely take her again.",1
"Prof is really nice, but the course itself is super hard. Make sure u do your homework. I got a huge curve in the final.",1
"She was very helpful. There was a lot of homework but was it never too hard. If you show up to class and do all of the work, you'll pass. If you have this teacher, don't worry- all will be well!",1
"By far the worst professor I have had in my 4 years of college. From the first week, students switched out of her class to another section with a different professor. Avoid her at all costs. Her grading is completely arbitrary and her lectures are just awful. Youre better off teaching Soil Science yourself!",0
Not clear AT ALL on what essays need to be written for his class. And NEVER responds to emails. Most incompetent prof.,0
"Took over the summer. Did not learn anything from lecture, learned every the material on my own, but attendance was required. Spends too much time on a problem when stuck, and shows that he did not review materials before lecturing. Lab was a mess, did not explain the procedure or setup, and left us 10mins to do the lab at the end.",0
"His lectures will put you to sleep within five minutes. Coursework is easy but time-consuming because he's so nit picky. Disorganized and looks for ways to cut points. Penalizes heavily for insignificant mistakes, and claims that's how the real world works. Seems to think students are stupid. Overly critical and just downright awkward. AVOID.",0
"He is very pationate about this course.  He doesnt stick so well with the syllabus, and his class is a LOT of writing, but he does make it very interesting.",1
You'll get use to his humor. He's a funny guy and made the material fun to learn. Get connect and start it. 50 questions on all exams except final is 75Q. Exams based on notes. Write everything he says and puts on the board. Curves n gives EC. He was my favorite professor and I enjoyed coming to his 8pm class after a long day. Highly recommend!,1
The class itself is pretty tough if you don't enjoy science and descriptive ways of how to conduct research. My roommate would spend hours studying the textbook to ensure an A on the difficult quizzes every other week. LaBelle gives great feedback and is more than willing to help in her office hours. Although I didn't enjoy the class I love Labelle,1
"Very good teacher, although my views differ from a few of those of Dr. Dotts, he was very welcoming and open to discussion/discourse. I learned a lot in this class, and would highly recommend Dr. Dotts for EDUC 2120.",1
"Wonderful Prof. I suggest getting note card program & taking your laptop to class, this way u don't waste time. 1st exam I got a C. 2nd I used note cards and did way better. For the exams (written), you have to remember the date, title, artist's name and description for over 125 pieces. What I though I knew was nothing compared to what I learned.",1
DO NOT PLAGIARIZE. Careful how you reply to the discussions. I would not take any of his classes.,0
No Comments,1
This was a great class and Im so happy I took it. This professor teaches well while still letting his students pursue the type of art they want to do. Hes very nice and easy to talk to and his lectures are great and always relevant to business outside of the classroom.,1
Professor Drake is definitely the best history professor I've had. His lectures are very informative and can be confusing at times if you're not a history nerd. His tests are blue book and he usually announces when a pop quiz is coming up.  Definitely the biggest eye-opener course. Only complaint is that he does sidetrack sometimes about books.,1
"I had her for calc 1 in the fall. She takes attendance and has quizzes almost every day, but they are to prove to her that you understand the material. I didn't learn anything though because I had calc in high school and learned it a there. She's really a nice lady and makes a huge effort to help you pass.",1
I thought I knew a lot about computers but the class covers so much that I was surprised at how much I learned.,1
"Great Professor!! Compared to the calculus classes at a UCF this class is cake. I love the way he explains problems! He doesn't speed through them, but he obviously can't go too slow because there is a lot of material to cover. Quizzes and test are required, but homework is optional. Obviously with the more practice you have the better you get.",1
Amazing professor! So sweet and actually cares for his students!,1
"Great instruction, very approachable to a boring subject.  Does not use Snap or Aplia. Buy a used book.",1
This is really a good professor with a very good experience,1
Loved having Dr Monroe as a professor. His energy and passion for anthropology really shows through during his lectures. Loved having him as a professor and want to take his class again.,1
"she is a great prof, she'll make a required course interesting",1
THANKS,1
"Pajer is a sweet person who cares about you. She takes attendance but if you miss class it is easy to make especially if you email her ahead she is very flexible. You write 5 Essays throughout the semester, which are doable and she is willing to help you. You are supposed to get a textbook and an online access code but you never use it.",1
"He gives good feedback on work, but don't miss any assignments. You will definitely have to put in effort in order to get a decent grade.",1
Interesting course. She is there to help you. Attendance is a plus since she gives you the answers to her test. She tells you exactly whats going to be in the test. MUST BE AN IDIOT NOT TO PASS [with at least a B]. Gave 100 points of extra credit. Overall a kick bak class.,1
"Professor Thompson is excellent at teaching organic chemistry. I never had a problem understanding a concept, it was simply a matter of memorizing it for the test. While he's worth taking chem off-track for, don't be fooled into thinking his class will be easy. You have to work extremely hard for a good grade.",1
"my suggestion would be to avoid taking this class at all costs. clawson drags lectures on and on, and is a kind of a jerk. there are 6 pop quizzes so while going to class is worse than watching your grandma clip her toenails, it's kind of necessary since you don't know when there will be a quiz. the only upside is not having to take the final.",0
"The discussions in my Latin American Film class were all enlightening & I feel like I learned so much about Latin American culture from taking the course. Dr. Adell does an excellent job at inciting discussion & generally teaching. For my class, she neglected to grade anything until the end of the semester, which was inconvenient. Highly recommend.",1
she is really nice and helpful. she makes class interesting snd fun.,1
"got an A, but i WORKED for it. definitely not an easy a. big chunks of reading, but as long as you stay up to date, you'll be fine. tests are open note and open book, but dont let that fool you. show up to class, since test material comes from there. sometimes gave extra credit for showing up to class. overall a very hard but rewarding class!",1
She means well and did her best to adjust the class for covid.,1
"Interesting topic, but he makes it boring and even more confusing. Gives no feedback. Assignments are crammed and confusing. Does not help. Assignments will take forever, but only worth a few points. Avoid at all costs.",0
"She is a fun professor, her classes are fun, she lets us out early.",1
GOAT professor and advisor in department. He takes time to understand students and made it possible for me to get back on track as a student. Thank you.,1
"He really helps a lot and has an interactive class. He goes around to make sure you understand the math. The tests are managable if you go to class, and he gives a pretty good curve as well. From what I heard, I would take him over any other 302 professor...",1
Are you ready to do some math? ;),1
Excellent teacher,1
"Dr. Miller is a great professor! This class in particular was hard because I'm an undergraduate student who has spent minimal time studying the Civil War, but he made it interesting. The biggest assignment is a multimedia project about the Causes of the Civil War, but it's open ended and you can do what you want with it. I recommend him!",1
"She was Great!!! Taught to the test, gives study guides. The best summer class I could have picked.  It was a breeze if you attend class.  She is very patient, understanding and kind.",1
"Dr. Erickson is great! I took this class with a ton of people who disagree, but honestly, if you show up and do the work, youll do fine. His tests are difficult because they require you to fully think through the topic, but if you know your stuff, youll do fine. Hes also more than willing to help and easy to talk to.",1
"I would not take Liya for an upper division course. She doesn't really explain key topics clearly. Many times she'll just read from the lecture slides, and it seems as if she doesn't really know the information. Also, the book goes into great detail for certain topics, that are very complicated, but she'll hardly explain them class.",0
Great teacher! I learned a lot.,1
"Connects really well with students and makes lectures enjoyable. Attendance is almost a must because she does not post her powerpoint's online but you are able to drop your lowest test grade at the end of the semester. Tests are not hard and not easy, put in some time & effort and you'll get a good grade",1
"Yeah she's a great, easy teacher  and all. But she's the worst if you want to try and make up a test or anything like that.",0
My adviser would not let me drop the class. All he did was rant about conspiracies and the government. He briefly went over material before announcing that we had a test on it the next class. I love music and he made me hate the class. I was extremely disappointed that he gets paid to not teach.,0
"NEVER REPLIES TO YOUR EMAILS !! Beside that though, he's a really good professors because he makes you do applications that you would implement in real life for the labs and exams.",1
Dr. hill is a wonderfrull woman. Her goal is to help the students pass while helping them learn. I have enjoyed her class more than any other. She is also very helpful. Her test are hard but she is fair about taking them.,1
I'm white and I love Dr. Fontenot's class. He is in no way biased towards any race. Just because he is teaching a class about a specific race doesn't make him ****. The people who say these things probly didn't come into the class with an open mind and weren't up to learning about another culture and THAT is why they didn't do well.,1
He is a nice guy but should not be a professor. He does not teach anything and expects people to know the material before we even mention it in class. His idea of teaching is going over problems that we have not learned yet. Avoid him if you can. The only saving grace to taking him is the curves you will get since the tests are so hard.,0
"This guy goes out of his way to be helpful, clear, and concise. This is the best instructor I've had since going back to school. I have tremendous respect for him.",1
"Great Lecturer! his power points are based on the textbook. He s very clear in grading, and explains materials very well. Exams are not very hard, and gives quizzes every class. Hes Friendly and fun to talk to. I worked hard and earned an A+ and the class average was pretty good. I would def take his class again!",1
"Loved Darwin. Great teacher. Very helpful. Three tests, four group projects, one paper/presentation. Easy and straight forward. Go to class and you will do well.",1
"Extremely nice, easygoing, and helpful.  He can babble and be scattered with his material at times, but he always reviews it so it is clear afterwards.  He truly cares about his students and always attempts to interact personally with them.  He will offer help in aspects that do not even involve his class.  Few assignments, and you can rewrite.",1
"Only keeps you for 1 hr of the 2 hr & 40 min. class. There are 2 papers worth 50% each. Just use the power points & include your opinion &  you will be set. Papers are 10-12 pages, but the more you do the better grade you get. I have had him for 3 classes and 20 pages gets me a 94 every time. ",1
prof experimenté et maitrise bien la matiére,1
"As a person, she is very sweet and thoughtful. My only complaint is her grading. I really don't mind putting in effort but after a whole quarter I still couldn't figure out what she wanted. I would go off her suggestions and still get points deducted. Very frustrating. ",1
"Dr. Allen is very knowledgable about seismology and is always ready to field questions, no matter how ""dumb"" they may seem. He is always enthusiastic even though students may not be. Great class: pay attention or re-watch a course capture and you should be fine. Probably the best class--3 units--to get the L&S physical science breadth over with.",1
"He has no time for the class, too busy with his day job! Does not grade labs, you have lab exams instead and he is not good about explaining how they work. Never know your grade because he takes forever to return exam grades.",0
"One of the best professors at St. Francis College. She'll make you enjoy coming to class. Makes everyone feel comfortable and welcome. Lots of group work, but also lots of extra credit. I've taken her before and am taking her again. Would def recommend!",1
"I took this professor for Calc 114 and am having a blast! He is funny, gives lots of hw (all really great because the quizzes are FROM THE HW!) and the tests are similar to the hw and quizzes. He lets you know what you need to learn and everything. I have absolutely loved this class and the prof. He is always available after class. 10/10 recommend.",1
Awesome teacher! I used to struggle a lot in math and in his class right now I have an A+. I would definitely take his class if you struggle in math he is so nice and won't hesitate to go over something you don't understand.,1
difficult to stay awake during lecture. but he is super nice and flexible.,1
"Tons of meaningless homework. The book is required and you are required to talk ridiculous, detailed notes on every chapter. Dr. Hart is really nice, very knowledgeable, and is willing to work to make sure her students succeed. Be advised however that the course is VERY back loaded, be prepared for lots of work around finals time.",1
"Very hard course. There is only a few grades, so if you do poorly on one, it really can hurt your grade. Wish we would have spent more than a few weeks going over theories, since the exam material is 50% of your grade. Class time is mostly discussion. Be sure to read rubric for group project!",0
This is the hardest class that I have ever taken. Tom is a hard grader but he is willing to help you out if you ask him. I am a better writer because of Tom and this class. The reason for this is because almost every class day there was a written assignment due. There is a lot of time and effort that needs to be put in. Just be prepared for a lot.,1
"Seriously the worst teacher I've ever had. Take my advice and find another teacher. You'll be glad you did. Lectures were incomprehensible, he was really weird and grading on the final SUCKED. he is not consistent with grading at all. AVOID HIM AT ALL COSTS!! :(",0
Clear about grading and assignments. Followed the syllabus throughout the semester so it was easy to keep track of what we were going to be doing in class. Keeps the lectures interesting and offers extra credit but isn't the best at responding to emails. Also doesn't post grades on D2L so it can be difficult to keep track of your exact grade.,1
"This class was one of the best online courses I have ever had. Others have said it is an easy A but I do not think that is a correct description. If the A was easy, it was only because you completed all of her assignments and participated in the discussion board. I loved the way the discussion board is an open forum for everyone. GREAT class.",1
"Dr. Nevil is a great teacher!! She is so entertaining in class and makes class fun!! Just do all the journals and assignments she gives you, she's really strict on the deadlines but as long as you do them, you will do well in her class!! Very easy class!! I got an A!!",1
She's a great professor! It's a pretty easy class but you learn a lot. She's extremely caring and knowledgeable about the subject. She wrote the text book and it has review questions in the back. Take her!!,1
"He is passionate about what he teaches and stops to ask for any questions. This class is an overview of Sustainable development in other countries so it may be vague sometimes. Show up to guest lectures and DO the readings. although there aren't a lot of them, he does include information from them in the exams.",1
Best prof i have met so far.,1
"Alynn is such an amazing prof! She is very enthusiastic, keeping each class both fun and interesting. Her lecture notes are well planned out and provides many real life examples in order to understand the course material better. She is very helpful and can always answer your questions. Bonus: she is hilarious! 1110! She is fantastic!",1
He is quite the angry teacher whenever someone has a question he gets annoyed straight away. Ask more than one and he''ll barely even help. He makes it overly obvious that he has no interest in helping. As far as teaching goes well he DOESN''T teach just reads straight off a powerpoint. You WILL have to teach yourself stay away when possible.,0
"This was my first class at ASU and it shook me to the core. He is a nice and caring guy but I don't see connections between the lectures and the tests. IF YOU DON'T DO THE READINGS, YOU WILL FAIL THE TESTS. For this class you will a lot of writing and it doesn't get easier. If you form study groups for test then your grade will definitely improve.",0
"This class deteriorated my mental health this semester. Dr. Brown's tests are multiple choice - no partial credit. This resulted in me failing tests despite somewhat understanding the content. His lectures are just awful - an hour of rambling and not much else. Please take this course with a different professor - or better yet, at Wake Tech.",0
"Whoever said his accent was difficult to understand has him confused with someone else. You'll love him. He's very loud, friendly, and funny, and he'll learn your name very quickly. He kinda speaks in hashtags, it's funny. Also a brilliant organist. Makes everything super easy to understand/remember. Do whatever you have to do to take his class.",1
"If you want to take ENGL 2030 online, Lisa is a great instructor to do it with. The course is set up well, with smaller assignments due mid-week, and big assignments due on Sundays. She also considers things ""on-time"" as long as she gets them before she starts grading. Most importantly, she's a great teacher, and I think my writing improved.",1
"I took the online course for this, not really sure how it would play out. Turns out you will need to perform 4 speeches. The kicker is you need to find six people to sit and listen to you for each. There is a quiz for every chapters in the book, 15 total. Its an easy A if you do the discussions, the quizzes and make an attempt at a speech.",1
"By far the sweetest, nicest professor I have ever encountered. I really appreciate your time and effort. I wish all my professors were like her!",1
Shes only given out one A in her entire career of teaching is her story on syllabus day. I don't know why I stayed enrolled but wish I wouldn't of. The classes are boring and a lot of reading. She has no enthusiasm as a teacher and drills you with homework and papers.,0
"I took Stats after being out of school for 10 years almost. Mr. huff does an amazing job of explaining the material and spending the time needed to see others succeed. Study is necessary, but he gives you all the tools you need! Great professor! Highly recommend.",1
"Brent is a really cool and nice guy. He's always willing to talk outside of class and is really understanding. The tests are pretty easy, basically straight from the notes. There is a paper and a presentation that you have to do but that's about it besides the occasional test or quiz. Pay attention to the lectures and you'll be fine.",1
"Very entertaining lectures. Light journal work throughout the semester, few tests, and only one presentation. Would highly recommend.",1
"Prof Guzzone is THE best professor I have ever had. I took this class as an elective amongst a lot of arts & entertainment management students, and immediately fell in love with it. He is the nicest, coolest guy ever. Lectures are cool, and you get to listen to good music. I would take this over and over again if I could",1
I love this man.  I'm taking him for multiple classes at once for this semester.  He makes difficult material easier to understand.  He also is very passionate about his classes.  I would definitely recommend him for someone attempting to take a class that's both structured and enjoyable.,1
"Most grades are over the group research project. Careful with who you chose and the topic you chose. Some assignments aren't clear on expectations, but I think that is intentional. She is very nice and helpful when you reach out. Genuinely cares about the students, but wants everyone to do the work.",1
He is the most sb professor in BU. I take it for summer term but the homework is two times more than other class in regular semester. And we all think he has OCD because he just wants us to do everything in the exactly way he wants. I don't think he knows he can grade A in this class. I feel like my time is wasted and I did not learn anything.,0
"I have had her for RPE 31 and Disabilities II in the Winter.  She makes the class a nice friendly environment. The class is well structured, interesting projects and easy vocabulary quizzes. Just study and not screw around and you will be fine. ",1
Dr. Holgado is the funnest biology teacher around. She also really cares about her students and loves to get them involved! Overall an awesome experience with an awesome lady!,1
"Perfect class to take online. Always has tests & projects graded within 24 hours of submission. Expectations are perfectly clear and assignments are super easy to follow! Tests, as long as you read the chapter you should be good to go! Great teacher and great class!",1
"her organizational skills are terrible. She is quick to change the schedule whenever it suits her, without warning the class. The teacher even goes over lessons in class, which have nothing to do with the chapter we have read. She never responds to emails, and is quick to deduct points based off grammar. She's also Always late when grading homeowr.",0
"OH DEAR GOD KILL ME NOW! I DREADED this class every wk.the tests are beyond hard,& he shows the first films EVER made in EVERY country.try to take cinema 2 to avoid this.NEVER out early.nice guy tho.i just thot his exams were way too hard.BUT I HATED THIS CLASS",0
"Not the greatest professor in the world, but he is pretty up there. He gives interesting lectures and is fair on his grading. He likes it when students utilize office hours!",1
Zimmerman threw the syllabus out the door in the first couple of weeks of class. She would switch deadlines and move points around because she forgot to give us a midterm. This class was not made a priority. My advice: avoid her and this class at all costs during the rest of COVID. The only positive thing I can say is that she responds to emails.,0
"Fun class with awesome materials. Nice person, but grading (in absolute scale, not curve) makes this class very difficult. Take astr323 when Gelco(Zeljko) is teaching.",1
"Pretty dull lectures. Weekly quizzes with questions taken straight from the homework assigned for this week to encourage you to study systematically. Midterms were straightforward, final was a bit more challenging, but the grades get heavily scaled in the end.",1
"Nancy is a nice lady, if you try with her. She offers extra credit on tests, and allows you to use notes on exams. The ""A"" is a 95 though, so you gotta work to get it. Never read the textbook.",1
"Nice guy, tries to make jokes. Lectures are essentially from the textbook. He does give helpful tips about certain strategies for problems though, so maybe have a friend who goes to class. Tests are graded fair, and you can ask him for a regrade of a problem if you think you deserve a few more points.",1
Very tough prof.. make sure to attend every class or else you will pay the price.,0
"He is super nice and he likes to get to know everyone's name in class (even in a lecture). His tests are similar to his practice tests, he explains things well and just overall a really good professor. Only problem is that lecture can be a little boring but other than that, I would highly recommend.",1
"Class wasn't difficult. But professor checks attendance every class. Have to read textbook to pass. Professor assigns extra credit to help student's grades. Professor seems too busy, not the best to contact her through email.",1
"She is very nice and presents material clearly, fairly interesting but case studies can get boring after awhile.  as long as you do the work you should have no problem getting a good grade",1
"Dr. Schrimsher is the nicest lady!! I took her ""Sex and Gender"" class. Honestly, you don't need to buy the books because you're not going to be tested on the material. She will have you do a couple of short assignments and one research paper. If you're looking for an easy A with no tests, take this class!",1
"This class had a lot of assignments, but if you completed them and participated in class it wasn't difficult to get a very good grade in this class. Dr. Portaro is genuinely interested in her student's success and is one of the most kind and understanding professors I have ever had. Definitely my favorite professor I've ever had at SUU.",1
"He gives the worst grades ever. He lectured on A thing and mark you down for doing literally the exact same thing. He's good I give him that but doesn't allow him to be rude when giving comments. His instructions are unclear and his requirements are just too much. He's asking for too many things, even if you're doing everything asynchronously.",0
"David, overall is a pretty nice professor. However, his teaching style is VERY outdated. You take tons of notes everyday and expects you to know the information based on the textbook&homework. Homework isn't graded but DO THEM, EVERYTHING YOU WILL LEARN WILL BE BASED OFF THE TEXTBOOK. He makes mistakes so please POINT IT OUT to him. Also DONT SKIP.",1
"Very responsive , and she doesn't try to make the class harder than it is.",1
"To be honest I had no idea what to expect but Dr. Carter is genuinely a good guy and probably after he handled my personal crisis with empathy and concern I would take another course with him. There are weekly papers and two 5 pagers for midterm and final, but he will give you feedback to improve your writing and it atually helped me.",1
"very good teacher! He KEPT me laughing the entire class! He's awesome! very helpful!! Just remember to read! Las Vegas quizzes every now and then, but he tells you and makes sure you a fully aware that he might give a quiz!",1
"ECE 241 was not a hard class and as long as you review Professor Day's actual notes and Power points on Canvas you should be fine. His lectures most of the time did not relate to what we were actually doing in Labs. He would often get distracted very easily and go even more off subject. Great guy, very helpful outside of class!",1
"She's great for students that have some underdstanding of the material beforehand, but she's horribly confusing to those who don't.",0
"I found Ms. Ridenour to be a little tough, but she was very fair. If you came to the lecture, paid attention, and worked hard on the homework assignments you did well in this class. This was a work intensive class, and the tests were challenging. The snowflakes that gave this professor a bad review, don't understand what college SHOULD be.",1
Professor Lanham is wonderful! One of the sweetest professor. I absolutely recommend her,1
"As a rising star in computational biology algorithms, Jeremy simply oozes intellegence. Naturally, many problems deemed reasonable by him are often more challenging to the average student. 
 
 Bright and upbeat in class, resourceful out of class, and always ready to discuss theory, Jeremy is indeed a gem of CSE.",1
Ridiculous test questions.  I have my masters and I took this as part of a 2nd certification.  Hardest/ most obscure test questions ever.,1
This class was really easy. I took it as an elective and I was surprised at how easy it was. I also learned some pretty interesting things about nutrition facts.,1
"I have no idea what those others are talking about saying shes a bad teacher. The only way youre getting an F or a low grade because you dont pay attention in class and not doing your homework. I failed two math classes because the other teachers were horrible. Prof Choi Baek, not only a great math teacher, but shes a great teacher overall.",1
"Dr. Richards was one of the most amazing teachers I had. I learned so much from her and found her class to be the most beneficial at of all of the education classes. She's an amazing lady and you can really learn a lot from her. She is challenging, but everything she does is for a legitamate reason.",1
"Just to clarify I emailed her and you're not allowed a index card on the exams anymore. Overall she's a good professor. Do your labs, discussion boards, and study the study guide and you'll be fine. Honestly I think its an easy A if you just put in the effort (not too much work anyways). You can't turn in late assignments, but you have extra credit",1
"Online Math 90 Class.  Class runs itself.  If you have a question, don't expect an answer until after the assignment in question.  Don't expect your tests graded in a timely manner either, he'll blame the school for not delivering them to him.",0
"Online class: tons of reading, writing assignments, no test or quizzes just readings and papers. The only problem I had was that I skipped one assignment and instead of an A he gave me a B+, so basically he can be a hard grader.",1
"It was easy to see that Professor Huerta was very dedicated to her work, and she always prioritized her students. There were a lot of readings, but it was possible to pass the class without reading every page (just skim through them if you are fine with that). She loved hearing all opinions and encouraged her students to speak up.",1
"Shartin is a really nice guy and always willing to help. Class is very difficult and hard to wrap your head around. However, if you go to at least 1 extra help session and he gets to know you, you will at least get a C. Was failing class and went to extra help for the final and ended up with a C+",1
"Dr. Sweet-Cushman the lecturer and mentor is amazing. Dr. Sweet-Cushman the grader is unforgiving. In order to get above a B- you have to perfectly meet all requirements outlined on the rubric and then ""provide further analysis."" Your writing style becomes conditioned to quantity over quality. She likes when you relate topics to recent events.",1
"CONS: Took a slow pace, thus consequently less time for more challenging concepts at the end. Lectures were nothing to write home about (unless in frustration). Grades updated only after midterm and final. PROS: Slow pace could be good for some. Good guy, funny, cares about his students and clear knows the subject. OVERALL: Easier than expected",1
"Took 4 classes with her within the passed 2 years. Her classes are boring and can be hard to get used to her accent for the first week but after that, no big deal. She's really easy and her classes are straight gpa boosters and I'm not even smart that's why I took 4 classes with her. She's helpful too if you actually go talk to her in her office.",1
"I took him for a CIT 170 class and he was insanely amazing. I am generally a bit slower in school so an online class was very confusing for me, well for the START. I met with him twice and he really did help clarify it with TONS of patients. He literally sat there with me while we did one of my tutorials for over an hour. Take him if you can!",1
"I enjoyed the course subject, but Dr. Richardson is a bit difficult. Receiving graded papers can take upwards to 4 weeks. The grading rubric and feedback for the papers is vague making it difficult to improve from week to week. The group project assignments are tough to coordinate and complete in 1 week with the amount of research that is expected.",0
She doesn't give feedback or let you see what you got wrong on quizzes. This is especially a problem because she has made mistakes grading. She gets annoyed when students ask questions. I basically taught myself using the online homework and book.,0
"she is a tough grader only because she likes you to give lots of detail. I wrote 2 papers and got deducted points for not referencing correct y she's very picky- follow her guide to a T. IT IS A MUST to make it to class, she's very passionate about what she teaches and that is good to have, if you have questions she will go over it slowly 4 u.",1
"Weird, but good teacher! Sample quizzes and tests helped alot!",1
get a good TA,0
"Adelle is a very smart women and i respect her highly. I did enjoy her class, however i feel as if she teaches at a more graduate level. She approaches lecture with a lot of statistical language + data presentations that may confuse you if you are not an expert in stats, sometimes it was hard to follow along. There is a very heavy workload as well.",1
Probably my favorite professor I have had at UT. Really passionate about the material and makes it interesting. Relates things from the lecture to the real world and other things we might encounter in our fields. No homework; I would say the textbook is recommended but not necessary. The tests are fair and similar to practice problems. Best ever!,1
Dr. Zbeida's English 1301 class was ok. It is not an easy A. She gives you the opportunity to re vise your essays for a higher grade. There is extra credit as well. Other than that you will have to do advanced essays and it was more than I expected.,1
If u are willing to waste an entire semester without learning a single thing about English u should go ahead and take it.. It seems more like history class rather than English his talks too too much about nonsense and leaves way to much papers and gives no help what so ever with the papers and grades really harsh! Be smart and do N0T take his class,0
"Dr. Bartl is hard, but you learn so much from even taking just one of his classes.",1
"Great, inspirational professor. It was fun and wery worth while  attending his lectures.",1
I really enjoyed this course and the aspect of applying what we knew. Sometimes the concepts were a little confusing if you did you read it close enough. It was a nice refreshing challange of not being handed the answers but having to figure them out yourself.,1
Dr. Thompson is a fantastic professor. His lectures are very clear. He has individual meetings with students after exams so you always have an idea of where you stand grade-wise which is rare for science courses. The material is incredibly hard. He makes his own problem sets and that's the most useful study material.,1
"Knott is a great professor and is very open/approachable! If you don't attend class or don't care about your work she won't be as patient, and she gives great input for essays and bigger assignments. She's a good person to go to if you've got writer's block. I wouldn't have wanted to take anyone else for this class. 10/10 she made me a good writer!",1
"I loved her!  She really makes people comfortable, high energy, and you do improve.  I hated giving speeches prior to this, but by the end I was a lot more comfortable.  Some people don't like her much cause she can be a little hippy, but its really not enough to become annoying.  She's very easy to talk to, and one of my favorite teachers!",1
"I dreaded every single one of her classes. She constantly gives the class lectures about how our class is lazy and dumb and that we should go to community college instead. After she explains her lectures she always asks, ""do you understand? yes or no?""  although this class is an easy A, i do not recommend it at all. ",0
"The questions are confusing, the reading material is absurd, and the professor is extremely hard on grading. If you don't answer one part of the 2 or 3 questions it shows drastically on your grade.  Don't take this professor unless you're prepared for a stressful class andor major headache.",0
"The course work is just watching a movie weekly and discussion boards. What I don't like is how she has us post everyday in the discussion and have a ""conversation"" with other classmates. It seems ridiculous to do that because it's just about a movie, then we have to also participate in class. There is just a lot of participation involved.",0
She has no consideration for her students. Many students asked her if she could possibly make changes to the work load due to Coronavirus. She told them in the 8 years she's taught this class no one struggle with the course load. She failed to acknowledge that none of her other classes took place during a global pandemic.,0
No Comments,1
"Awesome prof! I learnt a lot this semester, and her classes are really fun. If you show up pay attention and put the work in you need to to practice the language you won't have any problems. She is a great teacher with an awesome sense of humour, I would recommend anyone to take a class with her. I definatly would again.",1
"She's really nice, but she'll end up just doing the problems and not explaining much. Even after asking questions she'll do it again. The things on the test can be something taught a day before, also a super harsh grader. Do not take her if you already struggle with math",1
"Overall, a pretty good class. She is very outgoing and entertaining, but can be a little over the top sometimes. Final project takes forever; don't procrastinate!",1
"Best Spanish teacher of my life... class was interesting and fun. I learned a lot, and things I was confused about from high school were all cleared up! Sign up for her class... asap!",1
Dr. Lane can be extremely rude. He's not the worst but not the best. Assignments are easy but pointless. Take class with someone else if possibl.e,0
I think I speak on behalf of others to say that he was the best in AJ. We miss you and hope you can come back soon.,1
"I went into college loving English, I have always passed my English classes with A+/100% as my final grade but this class? This professor makes me dislike English and makes me not want to write which is something I personally love to do. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PROFESSOR.",0
"She may be good in person but not online. She caught a student cheating and punished the whole class by not allowing us to backtrack on the test. She would also make the test on Sundays at certain times such as from 9 am-12 pm. Also, all the negative comments have been removed for whatever reason. I did all her homework and still got an F.",0
"This is the first class I took for my Masters at NAU. I thought that it went really well. There is a lot of reading material, but if you are good at skimming there is no need to read everything, just enough to understand the concepts of each piece. Discussions are easy points as long as you participate.",1
"Dr. Yang gives a lot of work and can be a tough grader, but she really is there to help you. She always responds to emails quickly and is happy to help with homework during her office hours. A lot of her class is centered around group work- she has group projects that are 20% of the grade. Also be prepared to do the entire class in RStudio.",1
Amazing Professor. 10/10 would suggest.,1
Really sweet woman!,1
"Great professor who keeps his lecture interesting and funny, I have taken him twice and as long you study for the tests and attend class you bound to get a good grade! ",1
"Mike Jurmu is a very nice guy. I can not say that about his classes. Worst grader I have ever had. If you're looking for a class that you just want credit for with an average grade, take his classes. Does not reward smarter students for their hard work, and everyone is within the grade average pretty much. EXTREMELY terrible grading. TERRIBLE!!",0
"I've taken multiple courses with this professor. She is awesome. I had a lot of fun in this class. Just like any other college level course, there are expectations. If you are interested in developing your critical thinking skills and challenging your world view this is a great course.",1
"Dr. H is a great teacher and knows her stuff very well.  Class is very interesting and is mandatory.  If you miss more than 3 classes, your grade will be deducted.  There is A LOT of outside work for a gen ed class.  The bookarticle readings are a must for doing well on the quizzestests.  She is very willing to help and answer any questions. ",1
"I loved his class! From the beginning, he had the entire semester planned out start to finish. He was always sure to give great feedback, and was always nice to talk to as well. He provides many useful links on his website, such as various resources I otherwise wouldnt have known about on campus. Creative way to make English a fun class to attend!",1
"Class has proctored pre and post-class quizzes. The exams are next to impossible. These exams are a majority of your grade, the final is worth 30%. A little bit of the information is in the book or in his powerpoints. Studied for a week and still barely passed an exam. Knowledgeable guy but awful professor. Take a different science to fill a prereq",0
"Huge language barrier, and you have to basically teach yourself. You won't understand a lot what he is saying. I don't know how MCTC hired him.",0
Connie is so sweet and so understanding. She is very ethical and very professional. She is such a good person and she really cares about her students and does all she can to help them succeed!,1
"Before taking her class I looked on here and she had a good rating but now It's lowered I can see why since I'm in the class and it's terrible, she's such a hard grader and doesn't explain work well I'm always confused, and I didn't find out my grade till the end of the semester, now I know who not to take for enc1102.",0
"Nagase-sensei is a ball of sunshine. She is always patient with students and always willing to help if you ask. She cracks the best jokes, too. I am always learning something in that class.",1
"This was by far one of the best professor's I've ever had. Very dry and kind of weird, he really knows what hes talking about. I encourage you to be open minded with the discussions and you WILL get it and pass. Super easy tests off the notes (study guides supplied exactly off the notes). One or two pop quizzes and extra credit offered.",1
"Chemistry minors beware: this is not an easy A! Furthermore, if acid/base chemistry is your weakness do not enroll in this class! Otherwise Dean's a nice but ineffective professor. 2 exams and final are easy, hard, and comprehensive, respectively. Several group work activities make you wish he would go over problems on the overhead instead.",0
You really should take lab with this guy! One of the funniest professors I've ever had. Half the time you don't even do the lab and he grades you on TAKE HOME tests! You rarely stay over an hour and a half!,1
"Taking Spanish 204 with Profesora Sánchez is like taking two classes at once. In the first class, you complete predetermined online assignments that relate to the textbook and have casual grading deadlines. In the other class, Sánchez just lectures on certain legends, history, and musical stuff that she finds interesting about Bolivia and LatinAme.",1
"Class does get progressively more difficult, but he is very straightforward about what will be on the tests. Tests are highly computational and easy to make careless mistakes on. Thankfully he is a fair grader. Not many kids go to class because his lectures are more abstract and theoretical, but I found them helpful and enjoyed the class. Good prof",1
"Great teacher, fun and entertaining she covers the material on the test very well",1
She was the best Professor Ive ever had. She teaches in a clear manner and cares about her students. She also is very sweet and outgoing. I used to not like math and now l dont because of her.,1
"Really knowledgeable in his field, caring professor. Easy, and not much work to do, only 1 case study, 2 papers and the exams. The case study is done in a group. I got a 90 in his class. Extremely easy grader on the 2 papers that are take home finals. Do not listen to the bad comments, take him if you want a good grade. Easy to get extra credit",1
"Mr. Trower was very pleasant,  he went through presentations slowly, which for a person who is not good at math is awesome.  He was extremely helpful and met with me on occasions to help me understand and he did so in a nice manner! If I could take him again I would! Such a sweet man! ",1
"She's clearly passionate about chem. Chem 101 isn't always easy, but she did her best to walk us through what we needed to know. I feel she could have elaborated on some of the more intense chapters, instead of just throwing the test at us because we were on a timeline.",1
I absolutely love Dr. Griffin!  He is a great person.  His lectures are great and the work itself is not too terribly hard if you just pay attention to the lecture.  He is very wise and shares many great stories.  I would love to take all of his classes if I could!,1
"I have taken multiple courses with Nancy and did well in all of them. Fair warning though, Nancy does not care about her students and has no interest in helping you succeed, even when you make an effort and/or are a good student. The classes are worthwhile, if you put in the work you will learn, but expect to do it without her support. ",0
"Ben was an awesome teacher. His lectures were always funny, but you still learn. The class is not graded on many things, but if you show up and pay attention you should be fine.",1
"Alright, Picky about writing",1
Falk makes his class unnecessarily difficult. He gives homework on topics that haven't even been mentioned in class until after the homework is due and these topics are not in the textbook he recommended. He runs the class like a graduate class and will spend all your time on his class. He is very understanding about life circumstances though.,0
"She is quite possibly the best and most caring professor I have had my whole college career.  She is always understanding if you explain why something is late and always willing to help you out.  I don't usually like class, but I always find myself looking forward to coming to her class.",1
"Some teachers lose enthusiasm teaching the same subject year over year; even though he's relatively new, I have confidence that will never be Noel. He is one of the most passionate people I've ever met, and a truly gifted educator. You may struggle if writing intimidates you, but listen to his feedback and do the work. You'l be glad you did.",1
"As a freshman I didn't even know what sociology was, after the first class I was hooked. Now I have a BA in soc., thanks, Lisa!",1
"She is a fair grader. She explains her material well so you can understand. Homeworks are easy in the text book. If you need more help speck with her dont cheat she is watching everything. Very understanding, allows you to make up work and gives extra credit. All the answers are in her PowerPoint. She is very nice and I would take her again",1
"Really a nice professor. I cheated pop quizzes but he let me pass the course. I had to cheat because I could not memorize all the things I learned. I was an international student, by the way.",1
"Rude, unforgiving, does not participate in BB discussions",0
"Hilarious, always making the class laugh, whether it's on purpose or not.  Highly recommended!  You will not regret his class.",1
Didn't really understand the lectures,0
"I really enjoy professor lee,she is amazing at breaking down the math problems to makes for easy learning with constant practice.",1
"man goes way too fast, mumbles, has horrible handwriting, and just all around sucks",0
"an earlier post said ""run for your life""  you can't, she is the only one teaching this class. she may be belittling if ask a question during office hours. This will be one of the instructors who will be in your ONE OF THE WORST lists. I think she found the WRONG occupation, but despite the years of Poor Student E-Vals, she has the same job?",0
"He provides good feedback to each student helping them improve. The assignments help a lot & could be applied to real life situations. The classes are very engaging and he posts videos available to class before the lecture, which helps students more with their learning process. The online textbook was helpful. Very fun and informative course.",1
"Professor Trower is very nice and extremely helpful. I would definitley take a class with him again. I took a developmental course and its pretty much self paced but he helps with every question. He does talk a little fast, lol, but that was not a big issue.",1
"Best prof! Easy, but you learn a lot too.  Impossible not to love her. She is very genuine and enthusiastic. She helps whenever you have questions. Flexible. Generous (she gave us books!).",1
"Bude is probably the worst person to be in charge of a whole major. Her directions are very unclear and she clearly does not know what she is doing . Her work is all OVER the place. She came in to our SL to introduce a paper, she came in with parts of her power point missing so she edited while teaching. Also her English is TERRIBLE, she needs help",0
Only qualm is she doesn't give 100% on any paper out of principle. Amazing lady who is flexible with your needs. A+ teacher.,1
Lisa is amazing. She's a great life coach. She legitimately wants students to learn and be successful.,1
Do not take this class if you care about your GPA. He refuses to give out good grades and there are only 3 exams which are so difficult. Teachers like this should not have a job.,0
easy and fun class. he is really nice and understandable. i learned A LOT.,1
"Prof. Spiczak is really smart, but is a terrible professor. His clicker quizzes don't really help you learn the material, and doesn't mention material that is all over the tests. You definitely need to read all the chapters and go over lecture PP's twice.  Also, he seems really nervous and seems to be staring at the back wall rather than students.",0
This man is the worst person and the worst professor.,0
"He's by far one of the best math professors, if you can take his class don't resist. He makes the subject clear and the class not difficult to pass. Just study and you will pass plus he makes the class pass by pretty fast.",1
Sure nice guy!! Is extremely good looking and easy on the eyes.. I could look at his chiseled body all day!!,1
"O'Hara makes the class on their toes by calling people at random. He brings many of guest speakers from the world of journalism to his class. Get ready to go out and interview people, in Coverage of Public affairs you actually get to meet people and post the interviews. Make sure to read the chapters, all quizzes are on the chapters.",1
"Works with you on extra credit and unclear answers on quizzes. Will acquiesce if it's not a clear understanding of the material. Lots of powerpoint, youtube. Easily amused. Very understanding if you get behind. Gives extra points and free answers on exams. Often forgets where his classroom is , always answers emails.",1
"Prof Ba is a really easy teacher, I am currently taking him for anatomy 1. You use mcgraw hill connect for hw(have unlimited chances to get 100), quizzes (3 chances for 100), and gives you a study guide the week before your test with the exact questions. No lab reports, has 4 exams for lecture & 2 labs (tissue lab& bone lab).",1
"I withdrew  from the class, as well as many others! We started with maybe 15 or more, by the time I dropped there were 6.  She did not teach the subject where the student could understand and retain the information! If you ask for help during class, her response is always ""Well..., I don't understand why you don't understand"".",0
One of the best professors I've had in PCCC. He takes time to make sure you fully understand the material before moving on to new subject. Reviews before exams are always a giving so you're not baffle comes test time. He is one professor who truly cares about the students....,1
"Loved this course! Professor La Belle is young and extremely likeable. Her lectures were very easy to understand and digest. She is very clear about what she expects in papers, assignments, and what will appear on tests. Loved that she shows lots of Youtube videos and clips that help you understand the concepts from lecture. Take her class!",1
This class was a class that started halfway through the spring semester . It started the week the covid-19 pandemic started so we never met in person. She was NOT clear on due dates in emails she sent and whenever I emailed questions there was a rude tone behind the response I got. She seems pleasant but its all an act. Dont take her class.,0
I think I went to class 5 times the whole semester and stopped going because I kept falling asleep because all he does is talk. I passed with a C because all you need to know are definitions which he posts online. You also need to know songs and what definition goes with that song which is the most difficult thing on the test. I wish I tried harder,1
Thad makes a very difficult course a little easier. If you like to be organized not the class for you. No study guides for lecture or lab exams. Lectures are fun and entertaining. Labs can get long but are interesting. Takes awhile for graded tests to be returned but he's a soft grader. If he thinks you know it you'll get credit. Great instructor ,1
Easy class covering a topic you have probably taken,1
If you work hard and attend class you can get an A. He is very helpful and he wants you to succeed. I recommend that you take this class!,1
"MS is a really phenomenal chemistry teacher. He understands that not everyone will need to know Orgo for the rest of their life, so he teaches the essentials, and really avoids trivial things. He's an engaging lecturer, and made it easy for everyone to do well. The tests are tough but overall fair.",1
"Lots of essays and essay quizzes. Instructor did not provide clear instructions on essay topics & her critiques were vague. The books that were required for reading were very 1 sided & I felt that the she was trying to push her beliefs onto us. We read a book about feminism, immigration, & police brutality. For an entry level class it was hard.",0
I took my soci class online and I was easy. But I used the study guide on the test and made 80s and 90s on every test. The TA is really nice and theres not much work in this class,1
Business Law 2.  Took this class Fall 2014 - Peruyera is a lawyer. He lectures each chapter via power point. Goes into Spanglish mode all the time. Funny guy. Easy going. Early releases usual. You will have a presentation and paper for the final. ,1
"THIS CLASS IS NOT WHAT IT SAYS IT IS BEWARE(super boring, gross, only take if in dc). However... Miles was genuinely interested in our discover class. He cares about the city, and his students and was happy to mold those two things together. I had some medical things going on and was always sure to check in, which is a true show of his character.",1
"LOVE HIM. Professor Caruso is not big on grading, but rather what you learn and how you understand the material. Easy A for sure, the bulk of the grading is based on participation.",1
"She is very nice and grades fairly. There are a lot of papers, but nothing too difficult.",1
Amazing. That's all I have to say about that.,1
Hes courses are very easy. He cares about his work and students.,1
She is a super awesome and hip teacher.,1
"He is very nice.  He will make you feel like he is judging your every move.  He will appreciate any contribution you make to discussion.  His syllabus, yes, is outdated and his grading is harsh, and he will try to make you care about stupid literature which no one cares about.  There is a lot of writing, and little room for extra credit.",0
"I enjoyed her lectures mostly because she has a sense of humor. There are two group projects (one audio and one live presentation), once a week hybrid assignments, and five exams (fairly easy). There are a lot of extra credit opportunities. Her class is an easy A if you do the work which is really easy. I would definitely take her again.",1
Dr. Thrasher knows history.,1
Professor Huerta is genuinely one of not only the most caring professors but one of the most caring people I have ever met. She cares so much about her students and building community between them. She is one of those rare professors who understand hers is not your only class and will work with you to ensure you are successful in the course.,1
No Comments,1
"Very funny, very engaging person, lecture are kinda boring (probably because the subject is) but overall not difficult. ",1
ENGL 398 proved to be a useful class because of Dr. Parker. He made sure we had ample time to complete our work (offering in class time and extensions depending on the schedule).,1
Great professor. He is very knowledgeable and fair grader.  I would recommend this course.,1
"One of the best teachers I have ever had. I am going to sign up for more of his classes, regardless of what they are.",1
"Dr. Bowen was very passionate about his class, however, he was extremely scattered. His tests were almost impossible even with a 5 X 7 note card. The labs were long and confusing. Only two people passed when I took his class, myself included. Unless you have a lot of prior knowledge to the subject, do not take his class.",0
"Though her class is lecture heavy, she is very good at teaching. She draws out a bunch of diagrams to help you understand. The only reason why people don't pass this course is they don't memorize/study/put in the effort. I took this in the summer for 5 weeks. ASK HER FOR HELP!!! She's really nice. Thank you Dr. Yamazaki!! I learned so much!!",1
"Mr Humphrey has a great personality and is very intelligent. Not too much homework, even though it was a 6-week class. He is very clear about what he wants, and offers rubrics and study guides. Just do what you need to do and youll get a good grade. Not a tough grader at all. It is an important class that I recommend taking as an 18-week.",1
"I had her for the first time in Classifiers. She's always willing to help you out. There are a lot of videos (about once a week) but it's ASL, obviously there will be videos. Our last project was a presentation in front of the class and I was having a hard time thinking of classifiers for the story but she helped me make sure I had what I needed.",1
I thought this class was great and Ms. Lytle did an amazing job. I took this Public Speaking course online and she was very clear and concise with her requirements in COM-231 . There were several speeches due throughout and she gave wonderful feedback. I appreciated this class more than I thought I would.,1
"Dr. Chalk is amazing! She is so intelligent and knowledgeable about the subject matter she teaches. I took her for Roots Lit and it was focused on empire, and the material was so great and I learned so much about orientalism and the legacy of empire. She is very organized and her lectures are very helpful. One of my favorite classes at college!",1
She is glamorous as ever but not as helpful. She will help if you go to office hours but she tends to talk in circles. I really wanted to like her but I don't feel like she explained what was necessary. I will say she attempted but it wasn't the best.,0
"He responds to emails within a few hours. VERY organized. he goes over everything that is due the next week, never leaves you guessing. He plans everything out on a calendar for you. There are no surprises. He is willing to take the time with students to go over anything they may not understand. Very helpful and easy to work with.",1
"At first, I thought this course would be difficult but after a couple lectures, I started to get very interested in the course. The way he lectures and connects topics back to personnel experiences, he really makes lectures worth while to go to. He truly cares about the success for his students and I would take another course with him.",1
He really cares about helping you understand the material and is willing to tutor you at any time,1
"Ms. Nuneville is truly one of the most amazing people I've ever met. I'm so glad I got the opportunity to take her class this semester. If you want a teacher that cares about you, take her class. I never opened my book, so don't buy one. She provides all the information you'll need for the tests in her lectures, which she provides on blackboard.",1
The sweetest English teacher ever. Gives the best lectures and she's hilarious. If you fail that class it's because you don't want to do anything. She gives snacks in every class. I took her for Enc1101 only on Tuesday We only did 6 essays at home which you only turn in 3 for the final grade and just do Mylabplus.,1
"He misses class a lot due to traveling, so expect a lot of cancellations and/or subs.  However he's a nice guy and a good professor.  Very intelligent, very well spoken.  If you put in a moderate effort, you'll have no trouble earning an A or B.",1
Great guy. Learned a lot. Very interesting.,1
"This was a very easy class, and I enjoyed it a lot. Sara allowed us to get to know her as well as the other students in the class. Our projects were fun, and the workload was fairly light. She is a very good teacher to have as an intro to theatre.",1
Great professor! She instructs very well and motivates you. Very knowledge for every level of fitness (in the weight room or her work outs in the gym). This is my second class with Ms. Thompson and I cannot wait for summer session (her cardio/body conditioning courses will be four days a week).,1
"This was a super easy class. I think Andre reads these comments and takes the feedback to heart and applies it to the course because the instructions were really clear and he was available after class to talk. Even in lectures, he would constantly ask if anyone was confused and explain stuff over again if people asked for it.",1
"Great teacher, makes Math understandable for the Math challenged!",1
Andre was a very thorough professor. He clearly explained the data and which steps to take for SPSS. Also held office hours to go over or explain sections of the paper one might not understand. The first assignment was extremely easy. You just need to make sure you go to class to follow the instructions precisely. Or you won't do well on it.,0
"DON'T BUY THE TXTBOOK! he will talk to u about it on day 1. his lectures were fun and engaging, and it's an environment that supports participating and learning. only 3 tests (non-cumulative final) + project where you visit a school. it's not difficult if you study, reading/attending lectures will help. his study guides  the questions on the test",1
"I enjoy learning from Hansen. He clearly loves what he does, and although he can be slow at returning papers, you would be hard pressed to find an instructor more engaging or intelligent. Smartest person I know, not just in his field but in general. Easy to talk to, always willing to help his students. Highly recommended.",1
Hardest class I have ever taken. Watch the student graders!,0
"i Highly reccomend this prof to anyone into music. guzzone is very knowledgeable, has alot of experience, is crystal clear, and is very good at keeping your attention. classes are never boring, he uses all sorts of media to keep your attention - music, movies, and combinations of the two.",1
"Great class! Professor Wood was very helpful, the class was fun and engaging. She encourages you to communicate, work in groups, and build friendships. She also teaches you key steps to get past your fear of public speaking. I would highly recommend her classes, if you pay attention, participate, study, and communicate you should do well.",1
Professor Jones is a boss! She is an awesome educator and very inspiring. She has been through many different fields surrounding and within the educational world and has a lot to offer her students!,1
He is not a good professor if you take him for an online course. Also doesn't provide good feedback. If he has an issue with your writing instead of letting you know with the first few weeks so you can correct it and still pass the course he waits till the end so you end up failing. Worst professor I have ever had is no help what so ever.,0
"Dr. Houston is not a good choice. You have to write EXCELLENT papers to get good grades. I had papers critique by professors and adults and till received a ""C"" on it. She doesn't seem like she wants to help and majority of the class  left after the 3 month of school!! DO NOT take her because she can make you life miserable and it is not worth it!",0
Carters exemplary character and openness to all paths makes students gather before the morning sun to re-examine their half lived lives. I long for the days when he would sing to us the anthem of the international workers of the world. God bless the sound of 1000 brains forgetting how to shop.,1
"Maher is a pretty solid choice. He can be boring at times but he's passionate about biology. Makes it super easy to understand. Takes attendance but does not tell you what days he is going to, so you have to actually go. 4 exams and a final, but he drops the lowest exam. I would suggest him, just be prepared for his monotoned voice. Easy A",1
"she makes me smile - she's smart, her classes aren't hard, but you still learn a lot.",1
"Great Teacher! he explains everything as clear as day. everything he discusses can be found in the book which makes the tests easy to write. he tells you what he expects from everyone at the beginning of the semester and it doesn't change. just do the work, pay attention, and take advantage of every free concert opportunity you can.",1
Super vague about all assignments then incredibly rude when no one in the class understands what she is asking for. Horrible professor don't take.,0
"Professor McEntire did an outstanding job instructing the Film Appreciation materiel. He is easy to talk to. Must have the book. Exams are a bit hard if you don’t put the study time in. Honestly if you have it together, and do your work, you're golden. If you’re just a seat warmer, expect to fail hard. He will drop you for not attending class.",1
One of the best classes I have ever taken; an example of why higher education should exist. Dr Boden is a consummate professional with a dazzling array of subject knowledge coupled with incandescent enthusiasm and remarkable organization and presentation skills. A masterful communicator who motivates learners beyond their own perceived limitations,1
"She is very stern and means business, but she is willing to help you in anyway possible.  She really wants you to do well and if you put in the effort you will.  I would love to take another class by her again!!!!",1
"there are only 4 tests thats it. long sections for reading. i think that he might be a good teacher for higher level philosophy class, but for a GEP class he is horrible",0
He's a really good guy with the best of intentions. He's always there for you if you need him. My only complaint is that he doesn't always answer questions straight. He answers with another question to make you think things through. This can be rather frustrating at times. But he's a very nice person and a strong ally to have.,1
Her teaching style is lacking in clarity. You are pretty much on you own for knowing how to write a paper. Her tips and tricks are not very useful.,0
Celia is an extremely tough prof. As a science student who is used to getting a lot of work-don't be fooled she gives a LOT of homework. She is really strict and for some reason thinks no one in the class studies and puts in effort while everyone is struggling and crying. I think I've had maybe 3-4 nice cry sessions from her class. Not worth it.,0
"Professor Schap is a great professor, and you can tell that he likes teaching. You will read a lot in his class, but it is manageable. While his lecture material can be very difficult, you will learn a lot. No curve, but 90 is A in his class.",1
"hey guys, anyone whose had her for bio med/soc issues...how are the exams? does anyone have old ones? she is very cool so far.",1
"Amazing Professor! I loved his endocrinology class! He excels at teaching and is very approachable! I highly recommend this class. You rock, Dr. Love! :D",1
My favorite NMC professor by far. He's very willing to help out and actually cares about your success in his class.,1
"I took Dr. Bowman for arts in contemporary society for the summer, online. Her class has a lot of work for being a 3 credit course but if you stay on top of it youll do fine. I was nervous from reading the reviews but I made an A. She expects you to write well so if writing is not your strong suit, I would not advise taking her.",1
"The lectures are usually boring, but it's good to pay attention. She usually hints at what the essay question for each of the 3 tests will be, so going to every class is important. She gives out study guides, do them, that is the only way to pass the tests. Define every term you use on your tests or she will dock you points. Be specific.",1
"Prof. Montague-Smith is hands down the best Organic Chemistry professor at UMD. He is tough and will challenge you and your will but after a while you begin to pick up patterns and things begin to repeat and it gets easier. Go to class each day, copy his notes, and study many practice problems and you will succeed in this class. Hard work pays.",1
"Avoid this class if its not mandatory. Assigned useless papers, took an easy class and made it as hard as possible. Would never recommend :/",0
"Sandra is such a kind lady! A great first year prof, she really made my experience enjoyable! She wants the best for her students and always makes sure students know that they are being thought of. Her lectures and helpful, readings are necessary, and course material is applicable to real life! Her tests and exams are fair. Overall, great prof!",1
"Classes are boring, tough and late grading... Get ready to warm coding skills before semester starts. Otherwise hard to catch up !",0
"The class is an easy A if you are one of her favorites. If you aren't, and you'll know because she makes it fairly obvious, then no matter how hard you work you won't get an A or even an A-.",1
Jill is an excellent professor! She is very helpful and explains difficult materials in a very understandable way.  It was her first year teaching at Concordia but she honestly seems to have years of teaching experience. Absolutely loved her class!!!,1
"Get Chegg. Very abstract, non-linear teaching. Your quiz and lab report grades rest on your group members, so hopefully they actually participate for you. Attend every class, even the shorter, non-lab days.",0
Extremely good teaching abilities,1
An amazing professor. This is possibly the best teacher I have ever gotten at Palo Alto. This professor is very understanding and loves to communicate with his students.,1
he's a nice guy but kinda weird.  its a really difficult class and his tests are also difficult.  if you ask him he'll help you.  if you do go to class (which most don't) you must pay attention b/c he's disleksit(sp?) and you might need to correct him from time to time.,1
"he took 10 points off just because I attached files one the back of the report not in between, not clear of what he wants, take a lot of points for no reason. if you write a nice detailed report he will mark you off. he took 5 points off my lab because I wrote the results and explained why ! I wish I didn't take him TOUGH GRADER",0
"Professor Ball does not give a lot of homework. He also doesn't require his students to buy a code or book. The work he gives out is so easy and his lectures are interesting. I never was good at math but his class helped a lot. And he is hilarious! Take him, I promise you won't regret it!!!!!",1
Dont know why she appears to be so mean on our marks: the lecture room is far from the other lecture buildings but she will always start the participation questions at the very beginning of the class? She doesn't consider if people would get injured on a slippery road when rushing from another classroom far from hers. Tends to give everyone lowmark,0
"*Took this class online due to Covid. This is an easy A as long as you participate. The class is literally gym, just exercise and record a time-lapse or use a Fitbit. Ms.Z is usually pretty chill and half the time won't take off for lateness (because for some reason she wants things turned in at 11PM and not 11:59PM). Also very responsive to emails",1
"Rebecca is very passionate about communications - it shows when she is delivering content.  She is very nice, approachable, and understanding.  Do read the book - she loves to use terms and concepts from the book during class.  The quizzes are also based on the book.",1
"FYI, John Street is the former mayor of Philadelphia. It's not quite as easy as in past years, possibly because he has a new TA. It's an easy A, but still a lot of work. That said, the Mayor is an awesome professor and equally awesome person and I learned more in his class this semester than in any previous one. I can't recommend his class enough.",1
absolutely hated her. An obvious failed screen writer who is trying to hard to connect with the youth. Class is useless and not helpful all we do is watch the behind the scenes extra features on DVDs. Would definitely recommend her as a professor.,0
Easily the worst professor I ever had in college. She is insanely strict and expects you to never make mistakes. Like EVER. There were many nights where I would just start crying because one little thing was inaccurate on my work and she would give the entire assignment an 'F' and be horribly rude about it. She does not communicate well at all.,0
awesome teacher...,1
"Sociology was a really easy class. There is a discussion and a quiz every week to do, and thats pretty much it. The final is open note and easy. Professor Robertson is really laid back. Shes an easy grader. I enjoyed this class a lot because she also had great feedback and commentary as well! This class is really interesting and a must for all.",1
"Pawkett is a guitar GOD.  If you're willing to learn, he will teach, and teach you well.  Prepare to laugh, cry, and play guitar like you never have before.  Take any of his classes, and I promise you, they will be your favorites of your college career.",1
"Shawn is one of the best professor at Humber. He cares about his students, give good feedback and was funny during class! He truly is one of the best professors i've had. Take his class, you won't regret it.",1
"Very enthusiastic professor who cares about what hes teaching. The only grades are 4 tests based off the lectures. He gives out extra credit if you consistently participate in discussions. Need to do the readings to be successful. Its not an easy class, but do the readings and listen to the lectures and youll be fine. A B is easily attainable",1
"Great class to take especially for business and or law majors.  This professor has many years of law experience.  The textbook is not necessary though may be useful to take the exams.  No petty quizzes and or HW assignments.  Just show up ready to learn and take four tests throughout the semester.  If you show you should get an""A""!",1
"Nice guy but not a great teacher.  He goes off on tangents all the time and ends up having to cover a ton of material in little time because of it.  We covered too much information too quickly.  The entire class consisted of slide shows, which just about put me to sleep everyday.  Boring class, but it was interesting to learn abt human tendencies.",0
She is one of my faveorite professors on campus.  She could not be more helpful or nice.  Her class is very interesting despite the fact that the material in my opinion is not exactly easy.  I recomend her hands down and wish I had more time to take other classes with her.  She has become one of my faveorite people on campus.,1
"FUNNIEST BLACK TEACHER EVER! She comes off as strong at first but just respect her, WRITE EVERYTHING DOWN shes extremly clear, and REALLY helps students to understand! I recieved a C in this class due to her grace upon me. Im so thankful i took her. WORK YOUR HARDEST, and she'll work hard for you(ie. extra credit/retests/notes4quizzes) No MyMathLab",1
"I believe I took her on her first year of teaching so she was very new and you could tell she didn't know what she was doing. Her exams were okay, just study off the power point slide notes. Her final is a combination of all her past exams. Basically I give her a 7/10.",1
"If your not interested in the Bible, don't take this class. If you interested in it, definitely take it. Professor Zank was engaging, interesting, compassionate towards outside opinion, and very interested in student's comprehension. One of the best classes I've had at BU. But remember... you should be interested in the subject first!",1
"He is by far one of the worst professors at Macomb. No extra credit, no help with homework, not willing to answer questions that expand on his lecture. He stopped giving feedback on homework after several students hadn't done theirs, so he took it out on everyone. No one can keep up with his workload. I ended up dropping and trying again.",0
"I love this woman!  Not afraid to say it how it is and how she want's to.  If you don't take an interest in the material, the class may not be enjoyable, but Mary has a wealth of knowledge and thinks at 1000 miles a minute.  Too many estudiantes tontas take her class, otherwise it would be one of the best classes I've had at this school.",1
"Professor Soloman was a very nice and smart instructor.  She was very clear and thorough.  When it came to essays, she was very clear and explained everything by helping us out. Wonderful professor, would take her again.",1
"You have to study well even to get B! But he tries his best to help students. Overall I liked his class, not outstanding, but excellent. His test questions and practice questions are much more difficult than the way he covers things in class. Make sure you read the power point slides and book to prepare yourself well.",1
"She is a fabulous teacher! Very enlightening, and writes everything on the board as you go so that you don't get lost or confused. Always available to help outside of class, and will set up meetings if you can't make her office hours. Not too much homework, and the tests come straight from the notes.",1
A very knowledgeable instructor at Thermodynamics he motivates you to push yourself beyond your imagination. You may not get the best grade however you'll learn a lot. In addition he loves turbines and talks a lot about GE,1
"Honestly, wasn't terrible, lectures are pretty boring and the tests are all written questions, no multiple choice and it is not the easiest. The only reason it was okay is because he was super lenient about letting me turn in assignments over a month late and got full credit.",1
Very nice teacher. She does power points along with worksheets and outlines. She goes out of her way to make sure you understand. I highly recommend her.,1
"Excellent prof, expérience hors du commun. Très drôle !",1
"She is a very nice indivudual but I felt she did not connect with all the students in the class. At times she looked at me like ""Are you in my class"" and she did have her favourites. Both Exam were HARD. Her marking not so easy either. I always felt what she was teaching made sense in her own head but most of us had no clue what she was saying.",1
"Mr. Rosin is genuinely a good person and respectable man, but having him as a professor, I failed miserably. The class is incredibly online based, and the online assignments are too much, as well as very time consuming. It's very easy to fall behind. And in class, Mr. Rosin would get distracted a lot or do HIS work wrong. Incredibly hard to follow.",0
She is hilarious thourogh and engaging lectures easy to access through office hours ... miss her a lot,1
"Worst professor ever. Last time I remembered Im taking intro psychology not an English class. My English class doesnt even make us write as much as she makes us. The discussion feel like essays. She so picky with grades, takes off points for the littlest things. Doesnt even give you feed back. I will never ever take a class with this professor.",0
"Online class was *very* easy. Assigns 7 papers, you have to do 3 of them. Easy weekly quizzes. Save 80 bucks, don't buy the book and search online instead. Final project is 25 page business analysis. Hardest part of the class - very detailed and hard so start early. Willing to grant extensions. Nice guy, I'd take again",1
"Helpful, bit quirky humor.  Has well defined powerpoint presentations for class.  Overall a great professor for intro psych.",1
Dr Ortega is really caring and nice but he made this class harder than it needed to be. He made it harder because of it being online with the whole covid thing which is super unfair. But he would give 8% on each test as extra credit since we are only graded on test. He also doesnt round up if you get an 89 you get an 89 in the class.,1
"You wont regret taking him, you will learn a lot and he makes classes very enjoyable.",1
"Benjamin is a great teacher. His class is very well balanced in terms of in-class exercises, explanations, and homework. Homework! the online system he uses is extremely helpful, the downside is that it is not free. If I had to take a class with ben, I certainly would.",1
She does not respond to emails. The instructions for the big assignments are not given until the end of the semester. The big assignments are very difficult. Wish we could have received them earlier. She waits until the end of the semester to grade.,0
"He's very flamboyant, but his 12 step process is severely underrated. I pretty much finished my paper while other 221 professors' classes were just getting started with the rough draft (it was due right around finals week), which was great because one less class to worry about. I thought his grading was a bit arbitrary though.",1
"I personally think that this class is interesting. BUT, he is really is a tough grader. It is like you will never be able to get good grades after all. To those assignments that he gave I think should not be graded harshly like that!",0
"He is rude and not nice. He chooses which students get certain questions. He chooses who kets easy questtions and who gets difficult ones, especially the annoying dates. He will let you know when he has had enough talking with you. He will also call you out if you email him questions a lot. He is a proffessor, he is suppose to answer them.",0
"Honestly one of the nicest professors I've had at UNI. She takes the time to learn everyone's names, makes her lectures interesting, and genuinely cares about her students. Dr. Goldman sometimes goes pretty quick in her lectures, but she ALWAYS slows down, repeats, or clarifies if students ask her to. She's fantastic!",1
Dr. Hill is by far my favorite professor at Sandhills.  She is dedicated and extremely helpful.,1
No Comments,0
"Dr. Richards is condescending, loud,and repetitive.  She could care less about you as a student and has no empathy.  She was gone for a third of the semester on conferences and trips.  Projects and work were focused for test prep. primarily.  She comes off as erratic and scattered to some extent.",0
Public Health: Class is fun. Article review and quiz every week.  Midterm and Final are take home essay questions.  Attendance is mandatory.  Fun Class. Great teacher.,1
Professor Kolluru is super kind and caring and her teaching is pretty easy to follow. She made it easy for me to understand calculus. Grades will be counted by exams and homework (WebAssign). She also gives extra credit when the class did poorly on a test. Easy A if you are willing to study!,1
"I have never, in my life, taken a course I didn't actually learn anything in: until now.  She is extremely misinformed in the world of healthcare.  Of all the non-truths she told our class the best one was that everyone should buy their own malpractice insurance because employers don't provide it.  WHAT? Ultimately - she's just pompous.",0
"Like the speed he teaches,  is slow enough so you can understand well. But his class lectures are super long.",1
Teaches very well. He knows what he is talking about. Textbook not required but the workbook is. Make sure you get the right one. If you need help he will gladly help. Can be reached out of class easily. Gives time to turn in assignments. If you want to redo an assignment you can if you ask. Learning a new language is hard. Be prepared.,1
This guy is funny if you appreciate true humor. He is tough though I will tell you that!,1
"Lois Gray is the sweet Grandma-type professor. She is really passionate about what she does. The lectures are long and can be tedious but sometimes she does powerpoints about neat places and topics, so they can be interesting too. There are in-class activities, so if you skip you can't make them up, so beware of those, but they are really easy.",1
"His class is meant for people who have never looked at a piece of sheet music before, so he's very thorough in explaining the basics. Sometimes he gets tongue-tied because of his accent, but it's not an issue. Some class work, your choice in getting the book because he posts everything on the board. Few easy assignments. Try to participate",1
"She's an awesome professor. The class is an easy A in my opinion as long as you do the work required. Theres about 12 labs, but you only have to do 8. There are 10 discussion boards, but you only have to do 8. 4 easy quizzes, but you have to do 3. 2 tests, but you can bring a note card. If you do the extra labs then you get extra credit. Easy A.",1
Awesome teacher for 101! Definitely take her,1
"Great professor, really knows his stuff. All power points are posted but only figures, so go to class. On review day he straight up tells you the answers to the exam(only if you ask ), meaning he will tell you questions he is going to ask you. Dedicates an entire lecture just to be asked questions about the exams. I would take this class again!",1
"LOVED HER. She can definitely be intimidating, but she taught well and was very engaging. I wasn't interested in the theme of the class, but she gives you a lot of wiggle room when it comes to choosing essay topics so it turned out okay. Definitely not an easy A, but totally worth it if you're looking to become a better writer!",1
"Dr. Braun is now among my favorite professors. She creates an atmosphere that values open discussion with the aim of digging into literature. She is super positive and encouraging, and truly wants to see her students succeed! Leading up to finals week, she understood the building pressure and tried to ensure that our class would be stress-free.",1
"She's not clear in grading. Seems to take points off for no logical reason, even if you have fulfilled the rubric requirements completely. Takes points off during assignments that are based on opinion... Very critical - but doesn't really give any useful feedback. No way to please her. Avoid her if you want to enjoy the subject and not resent it.",0
"The reading is extremely heavy. You will not cover all the readings most classes. On the other hand, Green is always available for the students to contact him through email or in his office and is a great resource. If you are prepared for large amounts of reading and active discussion, he is a teacher for you.",1
"Dr. Whitaker is VERY knowledgeable. He is not organized though (if he was I would take him again) & you will never be let out of class early.  He's a great professor, but not my style. It's NOT an easy A, but it's an easy pass. You need to read & study for the homework/quizzes (which he will never tell you when you actually are going to take them).",1
you! yes you! take her now because she is the best,1
"I took him during the summer and it was intense, however the hardest part was getting there. He made the material easy to understand his test required some thought but was based on the material. He gave homework questions that helped with the test. HE WAS GREAT I WOULD TAKE HIM AGAIN. GOT A B+",1
"One of the best classes I've taken at UMD so far. Professor Nusraty knows a lot about Afghanistan and is great about answering any questions you have. Plus, he brings in multiple experts in the field of diplomacy, which is super cool. Not too much work, more focused on understanding of the issues. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone!",1

"Great lady! Had for art appreciation and was a breeze. She literally shortens up class periods(2.5 hrs long only meets once a week), let's you use your reading outline on the 2 tests she gives all semester, and allows you to read or draw in the beginning and during class. Take notes and brush up with the book, and you are golden. Not bad looking to",1
"very energetic teaching that will never leave you bored, easy/understandable explanations and examples.",1
Super nice man and clearly very knowledgeable about the subject matter. Very reasonable about deadlines and assignments but strict on grammar and formatting. Lots of extra credit opportunities if you attend class regularly. Quizzes and tests are easy but learnsmart activities take time. Group project not too difficult. All in all I recommend him.,1
"Great marketing class, taken online.  Used the text often, and assignments were fairly easy.",1
Dr. Pringle taught the second semester of this course and she is a fantastic person and her lectures were well organized but her tests were absolutely ridiculous. She would ask a question about 1 sentence on one slide that would be completely irrelevant to the rest of the topic. She's a good person but terrible test maker.,0
"She's very boring -as is her class- and closed-minded. If she thinks she's right about something, there's no changing her mind. I would not recommend this class.",1
She explains stuff very clearly and always willing to answer questions! Very engaging during lectures. Exams are fair!,1
"Best professor on campus! Lectures may be a little bit boring, but you do learn a lot. Plus, the exams and papers are easy; minimal studying.",1
"Very energetic and upbeat personality.  Enjoyed her class.  She does a solid job of explaining everything, and allows questions at any point during the lecture.  Does a brief review (of the previous class) at the beginning of each lecture.  I found this very helpful if I missed a class.  She is very approachable and kind. She loves her sports too.",1
"Dr. Israel gives a fair grade distribution and does not give free As. However, if you do the homework and understand the Quest assignments that he gives out, you'll probably be fine. The difficulty is on par with any other class and is not necessarily easier than other M408D professors, the midterms and final are fair and are reflective of Quest.",1
"Professor Maynard is a pretty dry as a professor. She is not very flexible with assignments, projects etc. She knows what shes talking about but cannot easily relate to students. Lots of reading. No textbook since its online.",0
"This man looooves to waste trees and give the most amount of worksheets. In my opinion, this class is a very easy A, but the material on homework, quizzes, and tests is very inconsistent. He is very scatter-brained and all over the place with his explanations. He's funny and all, but I learned nothing about how to teach kids math",0
"He expects way to much from his students, doesn't give us guidelines of the course and whats expected of us. He's tries to be funny and mean (which he is) but then in turn it makes students scared to ask questions, then he gets mad and yells at us that we arent asking questions. Buddy curved our midterm form 23% to 46% ... he will give everyone F's",0
"He won't make it easy, but you'll lean a lot. He really teaches you to read fine details in every sentence that will make your writing and grammar so much better. He's much more effective at it than any other teacher or professor in the past. I definitely would have benefited greatly from taking this class before my first internship.",1
Is the best professor at Russell Sage... hands down!! Classes are hands on and engage you in thought... Students get involved in class! Much different from most classes where all that happens is lecture with no class interaction.,1
His class is designed to help you show your knowledge/earn your grade in a way that shows your full potential unlike the standard education system that judges a fishes ability to climb a tree. Though it was clear he was exhausted he really puts effort in for his students! I wish he could teach all of my undergrad neuroscience classes.,1
"Although he doesn't use lecture slides, you remember everything he says - still take notes. He is a story teller in nature, and very brilliant. Although he may seem scary, if you go to his office hours, you can learn to appreciate his humor. He is one of the best professors at Guelph. As long as you go to class, you'll get an excellent mark.",1
"This is by far my favorite professor, one of the hardest classes I have ever taken (due to the material) but she was extremely helpful, and she made physics fun. As long as you complete the work, pay attention, and don't miss any classes you will definitely pass!",1
Bad at communicating!!,0
"This guy is hilarious. Not a bad thing to say about him. Easy A. Nice guy! If you are waitlisted, show up the first day and he WILL give you a permission to add code regardless of position. One group project, few little assignments. Easiest class I've ever taken. DO NOT MISS CLASS THOUGH! ATTENDANCE IS MANDATORY!",1
Good teacher. Very fair and helpful. Don't miss any classes and be on time or it will count against you. She has and likes good manners so behave yourself.,1
I took Bushey for lecture online and it was by far my hardest class. I would study for the quizzes so much and take a lot of notes while watching his lecture videos and still fail most of the quizzes. Theres a quiz every thurs worth a lot of points and he gives u barely any time. Dont take him unless your super confident and dont mind stress.,0
"Excellent teacher.He knows Chemistry and he really cares about the students;he even has students over at his house for lunch EVERY Sunday.A difficult but worthwhile class.He's opinionated,but it's clear that he's not trying to force his opinions on to others but comically inform them of his own.",1
Great professor overall. James gives good lectures that are very clear and intellectual. The labs assigned provide knowledge in the course material and his grading is more than fair.,1
"Extra credit helps. Talks too much. Hard tests, grades on curve which helps.",1
he is the best professor in the world. i would take him for the rest of my college classes if i could. gives study guides for the test and he gives you notes. helps students whenever they need it and tries his best to make things seem easy. great i would recommend him for anybody.,1
She is making students right now (during a pandemic) get a camera for the computer due to academic integrity issues. Some people have autoimmune diseases some have financial situations where they can't spend money on items like that. I think its fine enough to use lockdown browser but really a camera? I hope she realizes what she is doing is wrong.,0
Great professor. Good lectures. Clear in grading.,1
"Dr. Avila really cared about the students. She made sure everyone knew the content. AMAZING professor, I understood everything she was teaching clearly. As long as you turn everything in, youll for sure get a B and getting an A Is also easy. Shes also very funny and sarcastic, you can tell she loves what she does! Great prof!",1
"Best Prof ever. He explains things well, and his notes are clear. His tutorials are really helpful. The first test reflects what we learned and was really fair. Definitely recommend him",1
"She is one of the most wonderful professors or human being I have ever met. She is hilarious+ a great lecturer and teaches you not only what's in the textbook but also teaches you what's outside the textbook, a real-life lesson. She really cares about students. If you reach out to her for help she would make herself available for you.",1
"If you are a student who is able to get by 100% on their own, then you won't have a problem with this professor. She offers modules filled with busy work and, if you do ALL of them, you'd do fine in this course. My issue with Ms. Dodson was that she's awful at helping. Doesn't give direct answers and refers you to StatCrunch or says ""it's simple"".",0
"He lets you know the first day how hard and fast the course is. He really does want everyone to do succeed. He frequently checks his email to help students. He does give a lot of homework though, but it is helpful.",1
"Ms. O'Donnell is tough and does not let anyone skate through her class. I dreaded this class and heard horror stories. But if you pay attention, apply yourself and make a concerted effort you can pass with a very good grade.",1
"It's important to go to class, take notes, do the hw, and practice multiple times. His class wasn't too difficult. I felt that the material was easier than Macroecon. He drops the lowest midterm score and adds points to all 3 midterms and the final. He also provides good practice tests for the 3 midterms. Take him!",1
"I learned so much from Joan. Really took the time to help everyone individually on the piece they were working on and made the class fun with her enthusiasm. Doesn't matter how many times you ask the same question, if you're still not getting it she'll go out of her way to help. Lots of extra credit options. Easy going, lets you choose your pieces.",1
"I took an online class with her, so there's not much to say about her lectures. However, the direction that she took the class was very engaging: problems regarding values were the center of this Comp/Rhetoric II class. It felt more like an anthropology or sociology course than an English prerequisite - definitely a rewarding experience.",1
"Do not take him if you have no prior background in physics. He is very unclear, moves very fast, and barely gives any examples. You will teach yourself everything. Grading is alright- the whole class will fail the tests but he curves the average to a 75 so that it is fair in the end. There's just no reason for multiple choice on a physics exam",1
"Currently in her ASL 1 class. NICE teacher and EASY class Signs kinda fast but ASK HER QUESTIONS AND TO SLOW DOWN Like any other language, practice is essential Class consist of:2 video assignments, in class sign tests, practice activities, & required deaf event paper I plan to take asl 2 with her in the future.",1
"Was worried about taking this class b/c I get super anxious about public speaking. But, this class wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. There's no homework, just read the book chapters to prepare for pop quizzes & practice your speeches. Dewey is a funny & chill guy! I personally enjoyed his class.",1
Terrible class. You won't learn much.   Teacher is not all together.,0
"Mr. Velasco is a really nice teacher. Participation counts in his class, but it just feels like everyone is discussing ideas nothing drastic. He is really understanding and just use the study guides to prepare for the tests.",1
"Great teacher. Great lady. Going to her class literally makes my day. She is knowledgeable in her field and is very good at sharing that knowledge. I could not recommend her more highly. Not an easy A, but she is kind and fair.",1
"If you don't understand math he is the person to take, He breaks everything down. If the whole class fails a quiz he will take blame and go over material again. You must be on time, do your homework and he will help you as much as possible. Wishing I could take him in 0310!",1
Managerial Econ is a rehash of Microeconomic and statistical evaluation. As an Economics major I breezed through majority of the work (a lot of it was review). Hui does an excellent job in paying attention to all student needs. She slows instruction for those who are having trouble with material. Office hours available and helpful.,1
Prof. Kopp really helps you come out of your shell. Public speaking can be difficult for some and Kopp made it a welcoming and less intimidating environment. Speeches are graded fairly easy as long as you're prepared and follow the criteria sheets. Quizzes every Sunday based off the online textbook chapters & are also super easy.,1
Dr. McDonald is probably the best teacher I've had at UD. His teaching style makes it necessary to always be paying attention which helps you learn the material very well The exam material is not hard but you need to make sure you know everything really well or you will struggle. He somehow made a Bio-stat class enjoyable and fun.,1
"Lectures are extremely fast, no clarification. i would not recommend him.",0
Rude and condescending to students. I wouldnt recommend this professor.,0
"Overall good prof, no issues with her or the class (GEOG101). Everything was graded very fairly and it was very easy to get a good grade on all the quizzes/exams as long you watched the lectures and take notes on the textbook chapter keywords. She expected us to read a lot but I never did.",1
"No midterms, only short writing assignments, and one final paper. Drops two journal entries. It is not required to have your camera on. The professor would listen to the students if they wanted something due at a certain time. Easy to reach outside of class.",1
"Her class really made me rethink what I eat, drink, and how I exercise. It is a really good class for beginners, even though it is a 200 level course.",1
He's funny,1
"Very knowledgable on subjects and conveys them well. I only had him for a strictly-online course due to everything being shut down, but lectures are VERY full of information that sometimes needed to be viewed twice to fully get all the information needed. Seems funny, probably funnier in person. Homework is straightforward with only one chance.",1
"Professor Humphrey is awesome! He is so funny & very helpful! You must actually put in the work if you want a good grade, but hey that's life. The group project isn't all that challenging and he is more than helpful with key points you must address. I would definitely take him again!",1
"Iliana is an amazing teacher. You have to study, do the homework and not be afraid to speak in class, but if there is any subject you're stuck on she will definitely help you with it. She really cares about her students and their grades. I loved this class.",1
"Easiest A you'll ever get. He doesn't take attendance but you do have to participate 5 times throughout the course. If you have social anxiety like myself, just send him an email and you can email him for participation points. Homework, tests, and final are all online and you can just google all the answers. Super nice guy. Take him!",1
"Prof. Dhar, is honestly understanding, helpful and gives reasonable work. If you're confused all you have to do is ask and he'll walk you through the problem. I took him my second time taking this chem because the first time I wast completely lost in the class and got a D. Would definitely take him again, and recommend taking him.",1
"AMAZING TEACHER! By far my favorite at STAC. I was never bored in her class because she is so funny and definitely someone you want to pay attention to. I'm taking my third class with her, and I changed my whole schedule just to be in her class!",1
"major grades are the midterm, final, a 12 page paper and an 8 page paper. Papers are not fun to write but he gives you ample time to complete them, and grades fairly. Pay attention in lectures because there is no way to access the material outside of class (no udcapture,textbook, or posted powerpoints). he's hilarious and lectures are interesting",1
"She is definitely one of my favorite professors. She starts out acting tough, but when it comes down to it she is very helpful and wants you to pass. I plan on taking her again for ENG102 because I wouldn't want anyone other than her. Great class!",1
This is my sixth consecutive course with Miller. 10/10 would recommend. She is hardworking and cares for her students. The grades you get back always reflect your own progress and effort. Always ask whenever she says a word you don't understand. I recommend Italian as a minor. Only 6 extra classes to take.,1
Explained things so I could understand,1
She was very helpful and nice. She''ll answer any questions you''ll have and always makes her class interesting. I would love to take her again for Eng 112 but sadly she only teaches ENG 111. ,1
"Queer Theory was an awesome experience! There's a lot of reading, but that should be expected in a 400-level class. There's typically homework due every class session but its doable. She is very nice and flexible with deadlines--just talk to her and she'll understand!",1
"Worst professor I've had in MAE and gave a bad impression for what to expect from the department. Homeworks were extremely difficult with really tough math, office hours are treated like an extension of lecture such that if you can't make it to both, you're going to do poorly in the class. Exams unrelated to homework, super hard, worth 50% of grade",1
"She speaks clear English, and has discussion questions in class to be turned in for credit each day. Rated a two because if you show up to her limited office hours (1.5 hours a week), she acts like you are bothering her and barely answers your questions because she wants you to do the work.",0
I've NEVER had a B in my life in an English class. This is the first time I was given Bs consecutavely on every paper. She offers no feedback & is very unclear with what she is looking for in papers. I should have just left well enough alone and stuck with the original class I was enrolled. Unorganized & very disapointing class.,0
"Since this class hasn't been taught in a long time, there's some trial and error to it. There are a large number of readings we're responsible for that we never get to in class. The citation style we use for class is also completely arbitrary as if she made it up, but make sure to follow her instructions clearly or you won't pass with a good grade",0
Amazing prof who cared about her students. She responded to questions quickly. Shauna expects full attendance and relates the course material to real life situations from her practice or from the news. Makes the class enjoyable and is very inspirational.,1
This is an A+ guy. Really cares about his students and the class learning the material. I just signed up for Calc. 2 with him. The only thing is that he is not available outside of class often.,1
You get what you put into it. She gives great feedback and responds to emails in a timely matter. Voice your opinions during discussions. Homework and online discussions are super easy if you read the material. She super clear on what she expects and will dock points if you stray.,1
Jason has become one of my favorite professors ever. I switched into his class last minute and I'm so glad I did. Stats was my favorite class this semester because he taught it so well and made it interesting! He was very accommodating and understanding when it came to the COVID situation. He truly cares about statistics and his students.,1
She grades like it is a 400 level course and she never answers her email so don't bother trying to ask her for help through an email. Avoid getting her at all costs,0
TERRIBLE AVOID AT ALL COST!!!,0
"He gives assignments but they aren't graded. Instead, if you did all of the required problems, he counts the assignment as a number of extra credit points which are awarded to you on the unit test. Lectures are awesome! Tests are not over complicated and are a fair judge of your understanding of the material.",1
Gives a daily quiz almost every class which is one question that she basically gives you the answer for. Only grades the first 15 so anything after that is extra credit. Assigns few out of class assignments and those are extra credit. Essentially come to class and pay attention and you'll pass with flying colors. Does grade participation points. ,1
Took Prof. Cygan for Music 101. TBH as a previous piano player I thought I would do good in this class because I know a little about music but this class was not all that easy. The class website is a little weird but I got the hang of it after a while. Prof Cygan gives great feedback but you never really know when things are due. Overall just okay.,1
"I really liked Professor Pearson, she is very clear about what she expects but allows you to venture out into your own ideas. She's super easy to talk to and is really understanding. Lots of books, but they are all super interesting. Luckily my class was super talkative so we always got into in depth conversations.",1
"He is a caring and easy professor, just do what he asks without complaining and he will respect you, and you'll have a good time.",1
good teacher,1
Hate English classes but he managed to get me through it. Very little homework (Matter of a few essays in the span of a quarter) and have to read sometimes for class prep.,1
Mr. Brown is one of the best teachers I've ever had. He came to be a teacher from the job world so he has first hand experience with a lot of the material and has valuable stories about it. He assigns work frequently but it isn't constant. He gives plenty of time to finish harder assignments and is open to extensions (when appropriate).,1
"Attendance is not mandatory, but highly recommended. Prof has lame sense of humor, but at least she tries. I normally HATE math/anything math related, but I easily followed her lectures and found the subject matter interesting. She is very easy to understand and VERY helpful if you have questions, etc. Full PP lect notes available online.",1
"I took this class this past semester, I worked very hard for my grade. If you put in the time and effort you will pass. I studied a lot and spent over 3 hours after each class doing work and understanding the material. When she gets in a time restraint she will blow through the material very quickly.",1
"Nelson is brilliant, sassy, and honestly I wish I had taken a class with him sooner. I wish I could hear his lectures every day. Take this class and you'll learn more about American Lit than you ever thought you wanted to know. ",1
No Comments,0
Get quizzes often (worth around 10% of final grade). He has an accent which makes it difficult to comprehend what's being taught.  If you are new to chemistry then do not take this class. He is not straight forward and he can be confusing.   Most of the learning will be done outside of class through homework!,0
She is the best professor��,1
"Although attendance is required, don't pay any attention to her lectures. Study straight from the book.She wants very detailed answers and is a little nitpicky when it comes to grading. She does curve, and if she doesn't get to a topic, she will delay tests. Everything is straight memorization from the book. If you're good at that, you'll get an A",0
"I think Professor Wolverton is a really great professor, but her teaching style is for a very specific student. I love history, but she lectures using ONLY HER NOTES AND A CHALKBOARD, and for me personally that was super dry. The feedback on papers/exams was minimal, study guides she gave out were good, readings were dense/long.",1
"Having prof. Current online was honestly a really bad experience. I dreaded this class and its outdated materials and lectures - I was bored out of my mind most days. Assignments were pointless or confusing, as was the Canvas page. Most frustratingly, he showed an unwillingness to listen to the concerns and ideas of students. I'm so glad to be done",0
He is a great math teacher. He makes sure you understand everything and does not get frustrated with anyone.  He made sure everyone understood before moving on. Great teacher who actually cares about his students succeeding in life.,1
"McMillen is hilarious and super entertaining.l He says you need to read the textbook chapters 3 times to do well on the tests, but as long as you read once and take detailed notes you should be okay. Tests are almost all definition based or examples from the textbook and lectures are easy to follow. Don't know why he doesn't have a higher rating!",1
"Dr. Mensah's a nice guy, very energetic and creates a comfortable environment to learn in overall. His lectures are very informative, much of what he discusses makes up the criteria for how is exams will be laid out. Straight forward grading policy, and grading overall. Its much appreciated the non pro forma learning environment. Kudos Professor.",1
"Professor Harvey was amazing. Due to the pandemic during the semester, we had to switch to the online class (both lab and lecture), but she tried to make everything easier for us (recording lectures, great workshops, and etc).she is very kind and caring. chem 102 is not an easy class, get ready to study, but Dr. Harvey helps you a lot. Good Luck!",1
"Provides a horrible rubric for the class. Huge negative is her importance on rough drafts. 30% of the grade is based on 8 drafts worth 2 points a piece. TA rarely gives 22 on drafts so you basically lose 15% of your grade right away. Her response when asked about extra credit was ""afraid not."" Never comes to class, required to buy HER book online.",0
"She is new to Gonzaga but she is young, so smart, pretty, and very engaging. Super refreshing to be able to relate to a professor. She asks ""questions of the day"" and plays music while we work. She is not the easiest grader but her feedback just makes you better. She is awesome take her class! Her class is not dull and goes by really quickly.",1
This is the second class I am taking with her and I still don't know what it takes to get an A in her class! She is very smart and knows a lot about what she teaches. She expects her students to work VERY hard and be interested in what they are learning.Do not take her if you are looking for an  easy class or are not interested in the material,1
"This prof was okay. Her explanations of some of the material is very unclear and hard to follow. She also struggles with answering questions. She also gives little to no feedback on assignments,but luckily she is a very lenient grader. Overall this course wasn't horrible",1
"papers are typically 750 words. She will interrogate you which comes off threatening at first but is only trying to help you with critical thinking. She grades toughly and has many pet peeves so write them down. She will relate things back to her personal life, which I liked. Mid term is very easy. You need the book the Longman Reader",1
"Dr. Wessel is very caring and does everything she can to maximize her students' grades. She is very reasonable and her assignments/exams are doable as long as you follow and study her notes. She gives you guided notes, extra credit, and really wants students to learn. She is really sweet and personable and I totally would take a class w/ her again!",1
"This is a tough class, but it actually works! Dr. Krings is quiet, but he's really knowledgeable and can be funny. The class only has two exams, but has a lot of homeworks that are easy to do well on. It also ends about a month before the other classes since all the plants die, which is pretty nice! Also, he will always outpace you on the hikes.",1
"Im really surprised at how low her rates are. Out of all the professors I've had she was one of the most inspiring. Unconventional, yes, but I learned a lot from her. I think being challenged to learn in different ways and to trust the process is important, and nobody does this better than her. If you let her, she'll change the way see the world.",1
"Professor Mayne is great! She is clear and concise with her assignments and provides great feedback on all your papers. This course was 8 weeks long, 2-page paper ever week about a case that involved compensation management and a discussion. She also gives the opportunity for extra credit. Great material as well!",1
"Seriously best teacher ever! His notes are from the book. Explains everything. How to do your homeowork, what needs to be on it etc. so glad I took him.",1
"she is one of the best nursing instructors at OCC, she is very funny and very good at explaining material, tests are hard, must understand patho to pass.",1
She definitely knows her stuff! I really thought the first semester of the nursing program would be more difficult. I didn't read as much as I thought I would since Professor Cain-Smith provides great power-points and a study guide. Its pretty difficult to get an A since there isn't much room for error. No fault of the teacher though; 93% is an A.,1
"Dowding is funny and knowledgeable, but he is an extremely tough grader. He cold calls throughout the class and can be condescending at times. It doesn't matter how much time or effort you put it, he will still grade harshly.",0
She is very sweet and will answer any questions you have is detail. She will write out the notes in class so she won't go too fast. totally would recommend her!,1
I am a his big fan. : ),1
"Such a fun and interactive class! Loved going to it and learning about new philosophical concepts. Had a great time and Dr. Gentry was super nice and laid back. The class has 3 essays, a couple of quizzes, and a couple of paragraphs. If you do the readings and actually try on your papers you will definitely pass with an A.",1
He is a great teacher.  Not a single person dropped his class.  His tests are open book.  All you need to do is your homework and you have an easy A!,1
"Professor Chidinma Udezeh taught my Special Topics in international Businesss class (IBUS 1391). I made a B in this class. She is in the habit of saying ' im here to help you succeed', which i believe completely, but i doubt that she will be willing to help you succeed if you are not willing to help yourself :). Yep, i know folks who failed too.",1
Jen gave funny anecdotal lectures. She LOVES to lecture. She gives good feedback on assignments but she will hate you if you don't come to her tutorial class and email her for things.,1
unorganized and grades pathetically hard! most students dreaded the class,0
"Handouts are the study material for exams.  Field trips are a BLAST - you HAVE to love field trips to take ANY course with him.  Sample questions often show up on the exams.  Study, read, participate and ENJOY.",1
Professor Huerta was super kind and caring and I loved her. Her class does require a lot of time and effort because of the labs and module projects but they are not too difficult. There are a lot of readings but show up to class and they are all discussed. Would def take her again she gives many extra credit opportunities and wants you to pass.,1
She is great! Take her class!! You get 8 or 9 absences. She is caring and understanding! You do quite a bit of essays but they are all what you choose! I would recommend her to everyone! 10/10 ,1
"I took Mr. Stanglin's online 2306 Texas Government class and it was a breeze. As someone who has never understood government at all, Mr. Stanglin had a way of explaining it to where it was so easy to read into it. His instructions are very clear and easy to keep up with it. Would definitely take another class taught by him.",1
"Very kind professor and a very engaging class overall. It's almost all group work, so you learn to work better with others, but there is not much homework. Clearly a professor who cares about doing a good job.",1
"He has a nice assortment of hats. They keep my attention while he lectures, and in the end, I still get A's because his projects are dumbed down to the point that I'm almost insulted. Sometimes. Nice pants.",1
great prof and really enthusiastic. explains material well but expects alot. cant slack off.,1
"He was very chill at first, said that he only uses 2 hours out of 3 hours maximum, and does not require textbooks. And I thought he was a good professor. After a few classes, I saw how lazy he was. He posts another prof's notes on blackboard and expects you to read it before class, and in class he barely teaches. He's very lazy.",0
"Not good. Doesnt explain material very well, gets confused by the information himself. Doesnt do enough examples and usually stands there and points at the power point. Only uses mymathlab ppts. to teach. Tests are the majority of the grade, there's only 3. MyMathLab assignments barely count toward your grade, so if youre a bad test taker, beware.",0
"I would 100% recommend him. Homework three times a week that is a big part of your grade, three exams, and a couple other grades. Most of class is spent with him teaching and then you practicing. You will have to get comfortable speaking Spanish in class, but he makes the environment very comfortable. I can't say enough good things about him.",1
She is really disorganized so the syllabus is mostly useless. No one ever knows what the assignments are or their requirements or when they're due. A lot of class time is wasted and she doesn't usually seem prepared or to know what's going on. She also never answers email. However some of the activities are fun and she is a pretty fair grader.,0
"This class was very hard! But, Mr. Purser gives you several extra credit opportunities to boost your grade. He is a very funny guy and was very helpful whenever I emailed him. If you stay on task, do the work, and study, its possible to make an A!",1
"He is a great professor. Very kind, supportive, knowledgeable, and active. Don't hesitate and take the courses he teach",1
She talks very fast and when told to slow down she doesnt. She doesnt make a study guide and doesnt go straight off the book so its very hard to study for tests.,0
By far one of the worst professors I've ever had. Easy class yet I found myself having to bend over backward just to get an A. Marks you down for no reason. Creates her own grading criteria. I had to email her before every assignment to ask exactly what she was looking for us to do as she never follows the rubric that is provided. It was stressful.,0
Took Cell Bio as a nursing pre-requisite. It's been a while since I've been in school so I was surprised by the amount of studying required outside of class. Alison is intelligent and cares about teaching. She wants you to succeed and expects just as much from her students as she is will to give in return. STUDY STUDY STUDY! And don't miss class!,1
He was alright. Wouldnt go out of my way to take his classes again. Also all the lectures are online so in theory you dont HAVE to be in class.,1
"Great professor for 100. She really seems to love her job and wants to help her students. Decent amount of papers and assignments, but it is definitely doable as long as you hold yourself accountable.",1
So encouraging,1
"Professor Sanchez is a wonderful person who is very passionate about what she is teaching. However, there is an insane amount of homework for this class. Most of the homework is not difficult, but it can be time consuming and tedious. She is a bit disorganized and doesn't grade quickly, but overall it is an easy class.",1
This class is terrible take another one. Class has no direction the lectures are a waste of time and boring have nothing to do with the tests. Just an awful awful awful awful class and professor. Lazy no direction just terrible,0
Dr. Filipe is a great prof with clear expectations. I'm sure he will becoming a better prof with time and maybe will change his assignments from year to year :-),1
"Schaal's grading is black and white, he hardly gives partial credit. He likes to test you over examples covered in class that weren't on the homework, so show up to class. Also the homework problems are harder and rarely match up with the exam questions, take it with a grain of salt. Schaal is random, lectures can be hard to follow.",1
No Comments,1
"Pretty cool guy, gets worked up easily though.",1
"-tested us on content we did not cover -never responded to emails throughout the course (sent 4, one in regards to her broken midterm that didn't load images required to answer certain questions. was marked down for those even though they couldn't be solved) -took 2 months before she finally fixed a grade she accidentally entered as a 0",0
Bliss is the absolute best. Really enhanced my college experience. I supplemented class with jon from skoolers but still class itself was very worth it. I just wanted to get the notecard for exams lol. I look forward to taking Bliss for financial management of the firm!,1
"Its only 2 weeks into class and i'm totally miserable, IF spanish is your native language/your second language you'll love him we don't really learn anything new he just talks in spanish the whole time, I have a headache everytime I go to this class......he makes me hate spanish he is from Venezuala so he has a very strong accent.....Be Aware",0
good guy,1
Dana is on of the greatest teachers ever. She makes the class so much fun and she is very supportive with everything you do. She takes time to help you with no matter what your question is or what you're having trouble with. She's very funny and just an overall kind hearted person. As long as you show up and do your homework you'll love it!,1
She gave out an excessive amount of homework and kept pushing a liberal agenda. Every paper was and even the homework assignments were graded tough. Would not recommend to any one.,0
"THE WORST TEACHER YOU'LL EVER HAVE IN YOUR LIFE. she wont help you no matter what you do, and if you ask her a question in class she will most likely belittle you.",0
"Very knowledgeable, Lots of reading 20 chapters/semester. 2 tests and 2 sets of case studies. Attendance mandatory. Pay attention, read and reread chapters.",1
"She doesn't know what she's teaching, and as a result, grades harshly (notthe same as in the book, not right). The projects didn't connect with the course material. Each project consisted of 4 parts that could be a project to themselves.",0
"He is a great professor. Vey hilarious sometimes with the way he teaches, but overall he is awesome. Attendance isn't mandatory but missing one class can really mess up your notes. As long as you read the novels he assign (even though some are depressing as hell) and memorize the identifications he gives on the study guide, this class is a breeze.",1
"One of the best English teachers I've ever had.  She was very helpful, and I feel like she made me a better writer!  I recommend her class.",1
"DO NOT TAKE HARMONY WITH HER!!! If you are a music student, it is a bad idea to learn the basic from Prof Sellers.  She is very unclear, and while she is very talented and skilled, she is unable to teach what she knows.",0
"I know learning new language is hard enough,but she expects you to know everything.I mean everything! She lies too!Said she won't put some of the stuff on the exam. She repeated her herself atleast 5 times! But oh no,she had to put it.Everyone in my class had to say something about her.Thats how bad she is.",0
"Hes nice guy, very down to earth. The only thing is his lectures: show up, take notes to a lecture and PowerPoint, multiple choice exam every few weeks. Thats the whole class. Some people like that, other hate it, so thats up to you. If you have to miss a class, just get the notes from someone and study them extra.",1
"Worst professor yet. Hw and exam is a 400 word personal essay (informal). He reads everything directly out of the book with not explanation. He rambling a lot and gives unclear on essay assignment. He incapable of help you improve ur writing skill. he will noted when you received help even if you went to a tutor, he'll tell you not to do that again",0
"Mrs. Elfring is a  great professor! She's very friendly, helpful, and cares about her students. All of her assignments are geared towards the 8-10 page research paper which made writing the paper a lot easier. I would take her again if i could! ",1
"She explains with longs powerpoints, a totally confusion. She only says the date of the exams in class no emails. She in kind but doesn't help too much. Drops the lowest grade.",0
I gave him a good review earlier but now that I am in 122 I see that he did not do the subject justice. I am completely unprepared for this class and its only the first week. Please take a better teacher if you need to go on in chemistry. 121 is the foundation for the rest and I feel totally lost thanks to the poor teaching of professor Heske.,0
"ALOT of textbook readings, you have to read entire textbook for the course. My suggestion: Don't read any of it, better off don't buy the textbook since she almost never asks you a question from the textbook. May be 1 question in a 30 question MCQ. READ ONLINE NOTES EXTENSIVELY! Course itself is a GPA booster. Great upper level science elective.",1
"Amazing and very easy class. Lectures are fun and you can tell he knows what he's doing, I would highly recommend him to anyone looking into criminal Justice.",1
"-Connaît bien sa matière -Survole rapidement la matière -Comique, sympathique -Faut vraiment faire tous les exercices et aller aux labos pour réussir",1
"Dr. Sam is a great professor! He prepare his class well for the lecture and lab exams. Pay attention, read, and study hard and you will make it out of his class. Study guide and practice quizzes will come back on the exams, no games or tricky questions. His exams are pretty straight forward.",1
Professor Walker is a great teacher. She is very understanding and likes to truly get to know her students. All of her lessons and assignments are applicable to real world situations and you truly learn something. She even throws in random useful gems for students like what credit is etc.,1
"The course itself (feminist anthro) is interesting, and Margo also got the class to have lengthy discussions amongst each other, which I really enjoyed, and was fun to hear everyone's opinions, engage in debates, etc.  But, Margo takes forever to grade papers, and is horrible at explaining concepts. I learned more from my classmates.",1
Lit was a great class and we even covered film at the end of the semester. The tests are open book which was always nice and you do them outside of class (you get the day off). Some of the books are difficult at first but after he explains them they're really easy to understand. He is very funny in his lectures!,1
"Worst professor I have ever taken, he Doesn't stay on topic instead goes on random rants that have nothing to do with the subject were talking about, can't teach his materials, and knows nothing about religion what so ever. you would be wasting your money worth on this professor.",0
Prof. Ball brings excitement into the classroom. Math has never been easy for me until taking his class! He is very caring of his students and always makes sure if anyone isn't understanding  he will slow down and walk you back through it. MUST TAKE HIS CLASS!!!,1
"Dr. H is the best professor I've had so far at WKU! Her lectures are clear and contain everything you need to know for her tests, which ARE hard.  She has a great sense of humor and makes lectures interesting, and as long as you go to class [like you're supposed to] and actually enjoy learning with an open mind, the class will be very rewarding.",1
"Great teacher! Very inspirational and fun! She's super-fast when you email or text her. She even does grade drops at the end. Tests and quizzes are pretty easy because you can use your book or notes at home. She helped me overcome my fears with fun and simple stuff in class. I got an A, so I recommend.",1
"Mr. S is a great lecturer, even as just a grad student. I have never heard of anybody having a problem with him personally, and I found him to be respectful and unbiased during class. Whoever wrote the review below is a complete and utter moron. It is sad that a person like that is able to gain admission to SLU.",1
"Take this guy's classes.  i took 2 of them, tough but a blast.  I actually learned something.....I think",1
"Dr. Corcoran is by far my favorite professor I have taken at PSU. She is incredibly intelligent, caring, and absolutely hilarious. I have never been more inspired in my entire life to follow my passions, and she has motivated me to minor in Indigenous Nations Studies. I can't say enough about her-- take her classes, you won't regret it.",1
Took for Spring 2016 . Good teacher. Recommend. Gets kind of moody at times. Expect a lot of reading. One chapter a week with homework of a question or two. Easy Quizzes everyday when you come in usually about what you read. Group projects!! She's sweet and very mellow. A lot of presentations and one paper of 7-8 pages. Easy A class if you read,1
"Mrs. Fountain is a super nice teacher.  Although you have to work for your grades in there, she doesn't give unfair grades.  She is very good at keeping you interested during lectures, and she will help you with your speeches if you just ask for help.  She wants you to make a good grade, but she won't give it to you if you don't deserve it.  ",1
"As a person, Hoffman is the best guy out there, but as a professor he is just extremely hard. Lectures are easy to understand, but his exams are no where close to his practice problems. No extra credit, no homework points. He solely grades you on your exam grades. 6 exams in total and your grade is based on total points you receive.",0
"Kim's lectures are not mandatory. Most ASA classes, if not most classes at Davis, are synchronous and mandatory. I suggest emailing a professor before you take their class to see if their class is mandatory or not. Kim is very caring and understandable and will grant an extension if you need one, whether it's mental health-related or COVID related.",1
"Easy class. You learn more with AutoCAD the more you play with it. He'll give you some shortcuts on the keyboard that you might want to remember. There isn't much for him to teach, but he gets to the important things. Make sure to  work on the assignments outside of class if you want to turn them in on time.",1
"This man loves science too much for his own good. He will spend an entire class period going over something that he loves but will not be tested on, yet will only briefly mention something that makes up 25% of the test. Be prepared to study every small bit of the chapter as he grills you on the smallest details of the readings and lectures.",0
No Comments,1
The best Professor ever,1
Way better than the other teachers. He explains the material and helps you if your struggling.,1
"Extremely unclear as to what he wanted from our papers, would routinely give out low grades without explaining why, in class reading assignments made no sense as they were all from Victorian England. In asking us to write a research paper he made it impossible to change our topic even if we wanted to early on. ",0
Mr. Morley is a good teacher but tough on critques but I think it is becuase he knows you can do better. Take good notes and it shouldn't be hard. His final test is all of his quizzes so study and you'll do fine.,1
"Kristi always tells us to communicate with her if there are any questions/issues, but she never replies. She isn't clear with what she wants and is a very, very slow grader. Wants us to have long responses to other people's posts but there's not much to talk about. Lectures are just videos after videos. Why am I paying money just to watch videos?",0
"I found his lectures rushed, disjointed, and unclear. This is partially because his powerpoints are a mixture of the textbook publisher's ppts as well as a few other professors' lecture slides. It was easier and clearer to read the excellent textbook and skip all lectures. That aside, he's helpful out of class and his exams are fair.",0
She knows her stuff. I want to go into disasters now!,1
"Incredible! In the process of taking her for a second time and wish to do so again in the future. Very engaging, invested in her students, and always willing to discuss course concepts with you. Entry level course requires work for a 100 level, but is very ""real-world"" information that is practical to use.",1
"final exam was a joke. focused a lot of class time to things that weren't even on the exam. the group project was so time consuming. he is not a nice person, doesn't have time to help you, doesn't answer his emails for days. avoid taking any class with him.",0
"I didn't think he was that bad. He's a genuinely nice guy who will help you if you need it. His lectures aren't thrilling and he says ""uh"" a lot (he also gets mixed up because of dyslexia at times), but he puts a ton of notes on the board that help somewhat. The exams were fairly difficult, the quizzes were easy but were made up by the TA.",1
"Professor Smith is one of those people that fall into the category of ""too smart for his own good"". I was able to do decent at this difficult class with very small finance background, but a lot of time should be spent on analyzing and getting overall concept first before jumping to problems and homework - otherwise, you are doomed.",1
"excellent,responsive,invested, study for your exams from text. If you work hard you will get a good grade. She uses some audio and highly communicative. excellent teacher!",1
"She does not use her lecture time very well. She spends a long time on a particular topic, then has to hurry and cover other material in a very short period of time. Takes points for attendance in lecture and discussion sessions once a week. Overall a nice teacher, but I felt she made an entry level Biology course incredibly too hard.",0
"Loved this class! The four 5 page papers were a drag, but I only wrote 2 and took the final and got three high As. Very opinionated, but if you agree with him it is fabulous! He has a lot of great insight and stories to tell. Take a class with him before you leave UMass!",1
"if you can handle your class without attending lecture, it is your class. she is absolutely not helpful in her lecture and makes everything boring. she also never tell you what you are doing wrong and your opinions against what she is looking for are easily being disregarded",0
"This class was awful, i never wanted to go and when i did i was counting down the minutes to leave. She is not helpful at all yet expects A LOT of work from you and mostly all of it comes from the books she assigns. Notes taken in class were mostly useless, very unorganized and a very hard grader. I would not recommend this class to anyone.",0
"Professor Perez was one of my favorite professors yet. He is very passionate about teaching and does a good job at teaching. Only gives 1 midterm which is an essay, but he allows one notecard. The final is also an essay but does not allow a notecard. However, he gives prompts ahead of time. If you have a chance to take his Native American class!",1
I hate math and she was the only teacher who could make me understand it.  She is so sweet and nice and I learned a lot from her.  One of the best teachers at WCU.,1
"She was very unclear, the books that she has us read are interesting though.  Your whole semester will be essays and pop quizes.  The essays are back to back and you rely on your classmates to look at your essays to revise them",0
"this class was oddly difficult for an elementary ed math class. we constantly had pop quizzes and worksheets for homework, which is doable. but on the tests, the problems were so much more complex than anything we had practiced. the point of this class was to learn how to teach elementary students and i don't feel like i learned how to do that.",1
She is very smart but sometimes treats her students like children. She yells a lot and is constantly taking phone calls during class. She does not put up with any type of nonsense. She can be very mean and rude. She is very tough but means well.,0
He thinks the material is easy and judges students for getting bad grades meanwhile he doesn't teach it correctly. He thinks that if you fail a quiz it's because you didn't try and there's a quiz every week,0
English is my second language and she was always encourage student to write any thing as they want. Not learning too much about essay writing skill however it's a good experience try the creative writing.,1
For some reason I really like Dr. Self. his lectures are a little disorganized but as long as you record what he says and complete the study guides you should get an A on the exam. the only problem are the written questions because the specific TA I had was a super tough grader.,1
"One of the easiest classes I've ever taken by far. All you have to do is show up, take good notes, and you'll do fine. The material is very easy to understand as well and he goes through what will be on the test.",1
"I HAD HER FOR MY HYBRID CLASS, AND SHE IS EXTREMELY HELPFUL, I HATE MATH WITH A PASSION, AND IM REALLY BAD AT IT, BUT I WAS SURPRISED WHEN I WAS ACTUALLY LEARNING FROM MRS.MERRILL, SHE WILL EXPLAIN WITH ""APPLES"" LITERALLY SO YOU LEARN.. SHE IS A GREAT TEACHER AND VERY HELPFUL !!",1
"She's a great teacher. You will have to go to class for notes (they are fill in the blank). She gives study guides that follow what's on the test (they are really long though). She also gives quizzes that are only for extra credit points. However, some lectures are very easy and she spends too much time going through them.",1
"Sooo much extra credit! This class was really interesting, even kinda fun. He could stand to clarify what he wants for the practicals and group work sometimes, but he's good about making sure everyone knows if he gets asked a question about stuff like that. The guest speakers are pretty cool too since they have a lot of experience and examples.",1
"his class is horrible. He just uses textbook powerpoint and extremely hard tests. I thought marketing was be a bit easier, but this guy took to another level. You dont have to read the chapters 3 TIMES to pass, just go over the powerpoint slides on MindTap. Good luck if you have him!",0
"This class was so much fun. We got to get actual studio time and got to practice using the cameras, being director, etc. Very hands on class and so much fun! Felt very confident when making my own productions for class. Very enthusiastic! and helpful",1
Professor Kim is very hard to understand during his lectures. He doesnt slow down if you dont understand and is never in his office during office hours. He will make sure that you pass if you want to. He is a brilliant guy but not a very good teacher.,0
"She's rude. Does not know how to engage in conversation. She looks down on her students. At least, made me feel stupid. I agree with the person who mentioned that she discusses student's personal stories in front of everyone. Very invasive. She also does not challenge the students' thinking. Class is super easy and basic. Didn't learn anything new.",0
"Ms. Dixon-Brown is an amazing professor. She is super kind, and probably one of the best professors I have had. Make sure to participate and do your weekly assignments. Even if this class does not pertain to your major, it's interesting for our day to day life!",1
"I loved how inspirational and caring she was. She really helped me get through this class and also life. If I needed anything, all I had to do was email her or call her and she would help me with what I needed. I wish I had her for physiology next semester!!",1
I took him for creative writing and he's pretty chill I love him so much . He's so funny and so carefree but answers all questions thoroughly.  His work is so easy to complete and gives solid feedback,1
"Hes a good professor, he doesnt mess around but if you tell him you're struggling he can help you. I showed this class the least amount of attention and showed up to class and the final was moderate",1
"Great guy, but makes the course very tough. Gives you weekly homework which is not bad, but then the exams do not contain anything from the homework, they are just from his really long lecture notes. Not the most interesting class.",1
Awesome professor.  Seriously take him if you can!  He truely cares about students and is always available outside of class for help.  Also extremely experienced businessman who teaches with the real world in mind.,1
"You have to put in time for this class-you have lengthy articles to ready before every class and there are pop quizzes. However, he reviews what you need to know, and is a very understanding guy. He is also really funny! If you aren't willing to put in the effort, then this will be much harder. No midterm or final, just a project!",1
"Wonderful professor, inspired great interest in the subject. One of the best professors I've had.",1
He is a nice guy but the class is hard and the only way to do well is listening to his lecture,0
"A lot of online homework and quizzes. The textbook is also online. He is very nice but voice is low and monotone. All notes, pretty much reads off the PowerPoint. Just gives you a basic explanation about the problem. You have to teach yourself. Good thing is the midterm was exactly like study guide so make sure to study that.",0

"I meet with him after 1st week asking him how he saw this class. He said, come to class; be prepared when you come to class and ask for assistance. I did all three. He made himself available; I attended class and came prepared. My grade reflected my effort. What more can you ask for?",1
You can tell how much Chris cares. He's easy to talk to and he make the classroom feel like a fun learning environment. He gives study guides for mid-term and final. The assignments are easy and they don't take up too much of your time! The group assignments were actually really fun and they put me out of my comfort zone.,1
"Professor Endlich is amazing, she's bubbly and really excited about her work, that makes you want to be excited as well, the work is tough but as long as you follow instructions and turn everything in on time you'll easily get an A... 1010 would take this class again if I had to. ",1
"this guy is the freaking man. very, very, very, very smart and obviously well-educated. he won't stop until you're sure you know what he's saying. he even gives out notes to clarify things even more. everyone should take any class they can with prof. ross, such a character. a midterm & final, both are fine as long as you keep up.",1
She really helped me out with deciding my classes for the next sememster. She's nice and gave me some suggestions that I never considered before.,1
"She is an amazing teacher and her class is not hard. She takes attendance, but only to learn your name. It is not for a grade. She does a lot of fun activities in class. She was seriously one of my favorite classes to go to. She assigns kind of a lot of group projects, but they are not hard. I would highly recommend her!!!!",1
Shauna is an incredible professor! Excellent professional and a sweetheart!,1
"Dr. Lane rules! Lots of work, but makes you think! And, yes, hot!",1
"Gentil, beaucoup d'expérience mais passe trop de temps a nous compter des histoires. Apres ca il défile la matière en 10 minutes et tu dois lire le manuel pour comprendre. si tu fais les exercices tu devrais bien réussir l'exam. Qqun qui a deja fait de la compta ne devrait pas avoir trop de difficulté. Il refuse de repondre aux ques. pr la simul.",0
"Mr. Kula is my favorite teacher. He is strict and an old school teacher, but what is wrong about that?! He is funny, passionate and devoted. He wants you to study so it would benefit you in the future. It is the easiest thing to give students easy/free points, but it takes much more than that for you to succeed. He is not def easy but the best!",1
"Had Rick for 260 as well as an online course - He's never failed to be condescending and rude when asked a question, especially if he thinks the student should know the answer. Doesn't know how to teach the material in his class and gets upset when the entire class performs poorly on an exam that was written like he wanted everyone to fail. Avoid!.",0
Prof. Bonaccorsi is very gifted when it comes to chemistry. She explains everything in a way that someone who is just beginning will be able to grasp it. One thing is she is not great at keeping her lectures in check sometimes and it gets kind of loud so I would recommend sitting near the front. She also follows her syllabus exactly as written.,1
"This has been the easiest professor I've ever had. We never took notes we just discussed pieces of literature in depth and wrote multiple papers. She gives you tons of time to do anything, which is always a plus. 10/10 would take her over anyone else again.",1
"Doesn't like to absorb new viewpoints. Takes three weeks to grade one paper. Spends most of the class talking about how many poetry degrees he has and how much he knows, rather than talking to his students about the material. Wouldn't take a class from him again.",0
"Dr.G was a great guy, but his style of teaching just did not work for me at all. Took lots of notes on the board, so if you skip you wont get them. Rarely gives homework and sometimes puts things on the tests we never even talked about. He is eager to help if you email him, though.",1
"If you don't put in to this class what you expect to get out of it, then you only hurt yourself. She is very helpful and tries to break it down to simple phonics. It is elementary spanish and I applaud her for trying to make it fun.",1
"By far one of the best professors I have had! He is the kind of professor that makes waking up early to go to class worth it! You will not regret taking this course. Straightforward lectures, exam reviews, open note quizzes! Plus, an interesting subject!",1
"Dr. Sheridan is an amazing professor. His teaching style is refreshing, as he always makes us think thoughtfully about why history is taught in a certain way. His lectures are interesting and his jokes were always funny. Take good notes, listen during lecture, use his study guides, read all of the books. It's not as bad as it sounds. He's the best!",1
Great professor that is passionate about his work and wants you to learn the material,1
"Expect to work hard. Merve is clearly passionate about what she teaches, and likes to get that enthusiasm back. Very friendly and easy to talk to, but I wouldn't want to get on her bad side.",1
"Phil is an awesome TA. He doesn't grade the essay very hard and quizzes are easy. The class is nothing but powerpoints but he talks about his personal experiences with some of the topics and also goes into more detail with some things. Very goofy and makes class fun. Don't take his attitude as snobby or rude, he's probably trying to crack a joke.",1
"Really confusing, disorganized, no leniency, makes interesting subject matter boring and almost incomprehensible. Self study, show up, easy A.",0
"Plays favorties with students, disorganized, unclear on learing objectives, unwilling to help or answer questions, tests are very unrepersentive of course material, etc....  Need i say more?  I'd reccomend him to find a new profession",0
Arrogant.  Be prepared for a purely academic approach to Marketing.  No practical application from a prof with no real marketing experience outside of academia,0
she is unclear and always expect you do things at last minute notice like it is impossible for someone to make a good grade in her class,0
I took her Feminist thry+method in the fall of 2011. The class was small (about 15 people) and got off to a bit of a slow start as each class was facilitated by group discussions and people were wary to read their discussion questions. Overall though interesting material and interesting perspective on ethnographic research. Really enjoyed the class,1
"Good, funny teacher. I always enjoy going to this class. He gives homework twice a week. All homework is turned in online. No quizzes or midterms. Final is a group project. You have to go to class for participation points.",1
I decide to take professor choi for fall and let me just tell you she is so the most careless professor i have taken at elac... she doesn't care about her students passing not to mention she'll only provide extra opportunities until the very end of the semester and constantly has typos in her lecture notes. DON'T TAKE HER!!!!,0
She is very nice. I love her accent!!,1
Bob is a really cool guy and tries to engage students during class but his lectures are just so boring. He posts essentially the same thing through his narrated powerpoints which is better than the lectures AND the textbook. You don't need to read 3 times through but getting ahead early is really important. Overall nice guy just really boring.,1
"US HISTORY 2                  Basically, listen to what he says.  His stories are good, but HE WILL MENTION SUBLIMINALLY the topic the class is suppose to be on regarding history.  Write down those terms, highlight them in the book and you will be fine.",1
"Honestly, not as terrible as everyone says. She is an awful lecturer and makes the material dry, but if you show up to every lecture, take pictures of the images that she omits in her lecture notes, and have good memorization skills then you're fine. Easy A for science (biology) majors. The tests are a lot of writing, so you can BS a lot of it.",0
"Took two classes (335 and 352) with him and I respect him quite a bit. He got a PhD in JUnit testing, what a mad lad. He's very knowledgeable about programming and is capable of engaging in good discussions about the material. Sometimes, it seems like he's condescending, yeah, but I feel like that's because he thinks this is easier material",1
He was really nice and cared about his students learing the material. He made learning astronomy fun/easy. Your grade is based on 5 attendance checks and 3 exams. All you have to do is memorize the answers since he gives you the questions that will be on each test. There's no homework and you don't need the textbook at all.,1
Very Fair and understanding,1
"I thought Bill was an amazing teacher. I was terrified of math, but he makes it seem easy. If you participate, come in when you need help, and do all the homework, his class is an easy A.  Plus, he is really fair at grading. ",1
"Best teacher! Just read the night before and you'll get an A. She chooses interesting books to read that are relevant. Only one Shakespeare novel and she keeps it interesting. If you don't love English, you'll learn to love it with Dr. Chalk. Only 2 papers and she'll look over it beforehand for feedback. Easy midterm as long as you take good notes.",1
"BEST Hearing teacher, Just do what she says!",1
He is a great teacher.,1
Took him for Calc III. The lectures are very cursory so make sure to ask questions or you'll be stuck on the homework forever. Practicing all the homework problems will more than prepare you for the tests - one midterm one final - which are all that is graded.,1
"I had her for two courses and the difficulty level was the same for both of them; almost non existent. There is so much extra credit that you can miss a few quizzes and still get an A. She lectures almost all the time with a couple speakers, but it can get boring. Seemed like she wasn't prepared for class periods and read off of online articles.",1
Professor gives great feedback. Very detailed lecturer and if you go to every class and try he notices.,1
"This guy doesn't cAre about the students, he doesn't have a heart and he will fail you if you don't pass his horrible class. Waste time, waste money he doesNt teach at all. He just read the slides. Don't take him if you wouldn't like to lose your money.",0
You have to read the book or you will not pass. Simple as that and if you don't take well to sarcasm beware. But truly he is a really sweet caring professor who engages with his students .He gives EC to those who participate and he really strives to not only help you learn but learn from you as well. IHe rewards effort,1
"I took Dr Boyle's Queer Youth in the Media Seminar this semester and had an amazing time. The class is a great elective choice if you're a freshman looking to fill your schedule, and the class is so fun and enriching. Dr Boyles is a great professor who creates a great environment for learning and discussion. Would absolutely take again!",1
"Professor Stevenson, in my opinion, is one of the best professors at QU. She is so nice and very easy to schedule a meeting with if the information is unclear. Definitely take her if you get the chance!",1
Professor Katner's lectures in class are very fun and she spends a lot of time explaining more difficult material. I highly recommend attending lectures as often as possible. You will get participation points from clicker questions and learn a whole lot! There are two major exams that make up the majority of your grade. Find a study buddy!,1
This is the second class I've taken from Dr. Hansen. I really enjoy his classes and teaching philosophy. Attendance isn't mandatory and he doesn't ask any trick questions. He covers what you need to know and nothing excessive. A very balanced class that didn't stress me out.,1
"His lectures were the worst for me, I could not follow or understand them. U can miss class and be on your phone, but it is up to you to teach yourself. The Math Lab has to be your best friend if you want to pass this class. He is very clear on dates and what will be on the test. He provides amazing resources for you to teach yourself the material.",1
Amazing Woman!,1
"Really a great professor, always super prepared. Exams were easy as long as you went to lecture, nobody really ever did the assigned reading. Very accessible outside class and very invested in all of her students. Definitely going to try to take another class with her at some point.",1
"Hard subject, but Dr. Polster is a great teacher.  Be prepared to do lots and lots printing, because there is no textbook.",1
"If you naturally struggle with math, Professor Guetter is not the best at explaining things. He explains things way too fast and in little detail. If you don't have a strong foundation of mathematic understanding, his classes might be hard to understand.",0
Great professor! makes botany more fun by doing outdoor activities. Definitely recommend taking this class ,1
"Exams are all multiple choice, however very tricky and involved a lot of critical thinking. In the end, she did not give us our exams back so there was no way of finding out what we got wrong or give us a chance to study appropriately. Lectures were unorganized and each exam was on 2-3 chapters. The fin grade is based on 3 exams and participation",0
"There is no way anyone can fail his class. Show up and do the homework.  Exams are online.  Exams are extremely long, 3 hours long to be exact but its for your benefit it actually gives you a better opportunity to pass because you don't need all the questions to pass the test. It would be a mistake for anyone taking Accounting 1 & 2 to not take him",1
She grades really hard but the tests are probably the WORST part. She only gives you 30 min for 20 questions even though in the syllabus it says 40 min. Her reviews are almost useless because taking the test there is more info that you needed than provided. 10/10 do not recommend.,0
The cutest professor you'll ever have! Curve is not 13%. It's about 6% but depends on the year.,1
"This is a prime example of a professor meant to only teach to math majors. He has the pace and brisk attitude of a prof bored of teaching lower level math. To a savant, he would probably be well suited, but to an average- or even slightly better than average- learner, he's too fast, too intimidating, and too brief.",0
"Dr. Mensah is really a nice professors. I found the lectures very interest and learnt a lot about political economy. If you can appreciate intelligent humor than you'll like his course. Overall, a considerate and great lecturer.",1
"Dr. Lawrence is brilliant and knows his stuff. The senior course I took was about Faulkner and the Southern family, and it was really interesting, but very complex. He's very helpful and accepts multiple interpretations. Reading was heavy but doable. Lectures are a bit tedious, but not terrible. I would take a class from him again.",1
"Excellent prof.  He does NOT pick on people.  Do your work and you have nothing to worry about.  He is easy to talk to and really gets you thinking.  I can honestly say that I learned alot from him.  He's always willing to help and has a great sense of humor.  And yes, he's very hot!",1
Professor MJ was by far one of the best professors I have ever had and hands down the most inspirational person Ive ever came into contact with! She takes the fear out of public speaking and does it In a very fun and creative way. I absolutely loved this professor.,1
"Cannot recommend her online METR 100 for Ace 4 enough. Just two weekly assignments that are pretty easy to figure out. No papers, exams, labs, or anything difficult.",1
"Took him for my Spring2020 semester, definitely struggled since I'm bad at math, he required labs and that helped a bit, because of a previous comment on him on this site attendance was mandatory. Our class converted into online because of quarantine, don't think I would have survived if it wasn't for that if I'm being honest. Hw/book online.",1
I personally liked this class. She always introduced new material which kept the class interesting. Lots of assignments but not hard. Is very strict on attendance.,1
GREAT LADY,1
"I had her for two classes. The first, I did not really like her much. But for Summary Conviction, she was such a great prof. Really engaged the class with discussions. I found her grading to be very fair, you got what you put in and she was not going to baby any student!",1
"Wow, what a joke. This guy is horrible. Changes his mind on everything from day to day. Makes fun and insults people who do poorly on assignments and/or do not understand the material. Told the class ""if you don't understand my lectures, don't come to class!"". I honestly can't explain in 350 characters how big of a jerk he is. Avoid him at all cost",0
"She takes a little while to grade exams but that's because she wants to give you the most amount of points she can. She doesn't like multiple choice questions, but with that said, it's not all short answer questions, there are fill in the blanks, t/f, and matching questions too. Overall, really liked her!",1
Not a class to take if you want an easy A. If you are not a person that knows a lot about the Cold War as long as you show you try she will work with you. She also takes in consideration of how hard you try when looking at participation. ,1
"Worst professor Ive had. The first two classes were fun, yet Philip Brown is completely scatterbrained, and never stays on topic. Hes inconsiderate of your emails. He barely gives you homework, and when he does its not related to your tests. He doesnt clearly outline testing material. Tests are nitpicked. Too fast in lectures, you cant keep up",0
"She seemed a little overwhelmed at times. Mostly timely feedback was provided on scores, a few exceptions. Very participation heavy with lots of reading and study questions. No real tests, final grade from formal study questions (like a short essay) and presentations. Pretty easy A, but work-heavy.",1
Professor Cox is very passionate and knowledgable about this subject. She made the material very easy to understand and there was a very manageable homework load. I did not know anything about bio or anthro and was able to succeed in her class,1
Such a nice lady but very unclear with expectations. Hard to know what she wants until after grading is complete but allows students to work on the mistakes and resubmit. Read verbatim from slides (has fill in the blanks) and has in class exercises almost every class. Don't recommend but still possible to make a good grade.,0
Professor Riffe is a real gem. If you have the opportunity to take her for rhetorical theory or really any class you should. We're so lucky to have her at Charlotte. She looks for the best in you and your work and wants to see you do well. Incredible lecturer. She takes attendance but you wouldn't want to miss class anyways. A gem I tell you!!!,1
"I felt he knew the subject well.  He was helpful when I had questions.  Online forums were interesting, but I don't feel I learned much from them and they took most of my time every week.  Final was hard since he gave us a sheet that was supposed to have all the subjects on the final, but a lot of the questions asked were not on that sheet.",1
Save yourself some grief. No one wants to listen to Mr. God's gift to students that early in the morning.,0
Good Professor,1
Great teacher overall explains everything with clarity and is very helpful and understanding i would advise taking her clases. only negative is she kind of looks down to students on rare occasioms.,1
"Prof Hoffman was a great biochemistry professor! He's incredibly smart, but is kind and receptive to questions . I enjoyed going to class, and learned a lot every lecture. He can speak quickly at times, so it's tough to keep up with notes at times, but he gives practices problems to guide your studying (v. helpful!). I highly recommend him!",1
"This is definitely a course that you have to work on. But getting an A is easy if you go to class, do the homework and really understand the key concepts. The math does not go beyond basic calculus and matrix.",1
He is great! Just be sure to pay attention in class and you should be fine.,1
"Eyeopening learning about the music industry. Paul is an expert on it. Very funny guy, makes the students think. Long powerpoint lectures that are not put online so take notes. Quizes and responses are very easy. Midterms/Final are half mult. choice half written, know the study guide and you'll do fine. 1 research paper, start early, its long",1
"Prof. H is difficult, but so is this course. He went above and beyond during the pandemic by doing live lectures on zoom and prerecorded lectures. There are no boring, useless power points. His lectures are long, but essential to helping you solve the problems. Do hmwk and problem sets to do well on quizzes and exams.",1
"Metgulchi seriously drags you through land mines, but in the end you know everyhting and can do what you need with your eyes shut. put in the time and you will come out with soo much. and he is hot, for an older guy :)",1
Professor Kuhlman is an overall great guy and instructor. He maintained a great sense of humor amidst a pandemic and taught the material very well. Never once used a textbook. He always went the extra mile for his students and offered consistently for 1-on-1 zoom meetings for extra help. He knows the Calculus material very well and makes it easy.,1
"best professor at elac. all you need for this class is a printer. provides printable notes. Exam are based of hwk, lecture notes, and study guide. Use a proctor for exams. Caring professor. Makes you work for you grade. HIghly recommended.",1
"He's a nice guy but not a very good teacher, went to lectures during the beginning of the semester but stopped because they're confusing and often irrelevant to tests. You'll do far better in the class if you use the textbook and the assignments and lab manual questions he posts.",0
"David is a ""gotcha"" kind of teacher. He often times places items on his tests that he has not gone over in class. He is demeaning and rude when students ask questions during class. Unfortunately, he is the only option for many students who have no choice but to take evening classes. Made easy material difficult. Worst math teacher I have had.",0
This man is an amzing professor! He puches you to know the text and what you need to know to know the text. Take him if you get the chance.,1
Very Very Very DIFFICULT! I would not recommend her at all! She is a smart ass and does nothing but sit in her chair and read from the book. She expects us to know very little details from page long poems which is nearly immpossible! Just take someone else...,0
"A bit disorganized, but tries her best. Very concerned with student progress and approachable.",1
"This class is the hardest class I have ever taken. Honestly, cried so much over this class. So stressful and not easy at all! You work hard for high fives! But I wouldn't of taken this class with anyone other than Tom. He pushes you and you learn so much even if you don't want too. Papers due every class. Take home exams and the final was so hard",1
Mr D is the best! lectures a lot but you dont even need to take notes because he goes over every question to the test a few days prior. homework is jusy busy work and he grades really fairly. get ready for a 10 page paper! you get to pick your topic so choose wisely. He is a lot of fun and i will be taking 2 more classes of his in the spring,1
Tests were fairly hard. She got a lot of problems wrong while teaching and would ask the students to check her. Would not take a class from her again!,0
"Worst prof , incredibly difficult project he asks us to do without even teaching it properly. Imma drop the course smh",0
"The class and material were confusing but the professor was extremely helpful and understanding. She grades based on a curve and as long as you do all the work the worst grade you can get is a B- There are several quizzes and a final (no midterm) and 10-11 labs. Overall, great professor and genuinely cares about her students. Definitely recommend",1
"Although people rate him 2.0 and I am not native American student but guess what!? He is an amazing teacher who has a deep knowledge in calculus and know how to combine lectures with real situation (YOU WILL LEARN A LOT). It's true that he gives tons of HW but as long as you finished all of them, you will get an easy A (or A minus like me lol).",1
Good teacher,1
"Mostly had test and group work was considered to be a grade. She also didn't offer reviews for her class and was just expected to know all of the chapters. I would say her lectures were good, but I feel as they didn't cover everything in the chapters/tests.",0
"He is the best teacher ever. If you want to learn, you should take this class. ",1
Life Changing Professor; Learned About Life and Career Alike,1
Best professor at ASU.,1
"This lady is supper sweet, but she clearly has nothing else to do than make you so homework. She seems to forget that this is a 100 level course and that we take other classes. She assigns too many readings, projects and essays. Do take her unless you like that.",0
"Dr. Gilyard is an awesome, albeit intimidating scholar. He is knowledgeable about his content and doesn't mind sharing his wisdom gleaned throughout the years. He is a hardworking professor who can, at times, appear hard/harsh, but I assure you his classes will not disappoint. He's a great school/teacher, someone I truly look up to.",1
"Professor Woods is very detailed but over all its for a good cause. I would take her class again, just be prepared to put the work in if you want a good grade.",1
"Do his study guides. His test were cake. Like make sure you go to class and listen and take notes, he hints on what he test. The papers he mentions in class are useless, don't read them. There was never a question on them. His questions on the final were the ones that made me smile cause they were easy. The final was hard because of the other guy",1
ABSOLUTELY UNREALISTIC EXPECTATIONS OF HER STUDENTS. GOD FORBID YOU HAVE A PROBLEM IF YOU DO KEEP IT TO YOURSELF. WAS GETTING AN A IN HER COURSE UNTIL I HAD AN ISSUE NOW SHE RIPS ALL MY WORK APART AND GIVES POOR GRADES FOR THE SAME WORK I WAS GETTING A's FOR PRIOR. IF YOU GET STUCK WITH HER CHANGE IT IMMEDIATELY!!!!!!!,0
Always willing to work with you to help reach your goal for the class. Super laid back & he can make the class enjoyable at times.,1
I had Patty back in 2001-2002 and I agree with all the comments that she is a tough marker. I had to take her classes since they were compulsory courses. She's a great lady but get ready to work really hard for a max grade of 72 or 73. I wonder if anyone could honestly comment that they received an A in her class?,1
"I would lay down my LIFE for this woman. Best professor I have ever had. Not sure if I want to marry her or to be her, but probably both.",1
Dr. Hansen is a great teacher. I have taken two of his classes and he made both of them very enjoyable. He is passionate about what he teaches which helps make the material more interesting. He is a very reasonable grader and it is not hard to succeed in his class. He is a very friendly person as well and willing to help students outside of class.,1
"The reading material this professor requires is outrageous. There was no textbook for my course by he posted 10 or more articles a day that he expected the students to read. Some articles were as little as 5-10 pages but many were 20 pages+. If you have the option to take another professor, I encourage it!",1
Great teacher!! I took her class as a hybrid and was able to get an A no problem. Just do the work and you'll be fine. She's really nice and helpful too!!,1
"Prof Grof is def in the top 10 profs I've ever taken.  Her tests are difficult but she gives you a test review right before the test and she tells you SPECIFICALLY what to study, unlike so many profs who say, ""Study the first 5 chapters.""  The Uni is trying to conform her, but right now she's one of the best.",1
"This class is a really solid introduction to archaeology or anthropology overall. There are a lot of quizzes and readings, but if you don't read you don't lose points. The class isn't overly difficult, but you still definitely need to study for exams. The lectures are really interesting and the professor is pretty approachable. Overall a good class",1
"Lectures/notes are long and he talks fast but he is a great teacher and explains very well, Extra credit available, has some good jokes.",1
"FANTASTIC teacher. It helps quite a bit that the language she is teaching is her native language (unlike some teachers I've had in the past).  She is very thourough with the course material, and makes every class very interesting and engaging.  Quite possibly one of the only courses that I'd actually do over again because of the fun I had in it!",1
I took Brooke's 124 class this last fall and she was hands down the most caring instructor I've ever had. She is always willing to help during office hours to make sure you understand the material and that you are confident with homework and exams.,1
This is the absolute worst class and professor I have ever taken. She is an unreasonably hard and inconsistent grader. Gives contradictory feedback and is rude and belittling in doing so. Her grading system is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen. I should have dropped this class. STAY AWAY!!!,0
"Mr. Goodman knows his voice is monotone, but if you can look past that he is a great professor. All of his notes were on D2L and he would tell you what was important. He also stresses what other students have missed and wants student feedback to help more students learn. Very helpful and caring professor too.",1
"Awesome, funny, passionate, there for the students, actually cares about you, clear, cool, fun lectures, interactive",1
"She is an ANGEL. Easily the most entertaining and engaging class I've taken. She's very passionate about comm & rhetoric and teaches in a way you'll remember the info! This is a class you'll actually want to go to and look forward too! She's one of the sweetest & most caring prof I've ever had, TAKE THIS CLASS!",1
"while i was in his class he goes off topic, grades his students off english 121 and expect his students to know how to write a paper and does not guide his students on any assignments. Speaks very low he tries to be funny but personally i did not learn anything from this class i am retaking english 28.",0
She is such a caring teacher. She does give a lot of extra points.,1
L.A is awesome! Her class along with the content is so interesting and she makes it easy to get good marks. Would definitely take another class with her.,1
"By far, the best online course I have ever taken. Li Liu sets her students up for success by providing a very organized course, clear grading criteria, provides lecture videos, weekly messages, and is interactive and involved with her students. I wish all online courses were as organized as hers!",1
"Super funny and open discussion, Makes class enjoyable",1
"I took him for Finite after having to take math 0800 twice (failed once, passed second time) and he is truly the best math professor out there!! I wish he taught ever single subject because he is really the best. Gives study guides similar to the test. Multiple choice too! If you can take him, DO IT! YOU WONT REGRET IT!",1
The lectures are heavy and that is only because he takes the time out to go over homework(one of three things that will determine your grade). He is funny and open. I liked the class alot. The homework and exams are online. But he does care and wants you to understand the work.,1
"Her class is tough, but she is very sweet, not to mention very funny! I thing there isn't enough time to completely retain the material but I don't think that's her fault, but how the class is set up as in time. Definitely need the book, and will probably have homework on a daily basis most of the time",1
"Really great professor. Cares a lot  about students and sociology. Only two papers all year, a midterm and final. No homework ever. Lectures are kind of boring but always lets us out 30 mins early. Strict about no cell phones other than that so amazing.",1
"I love Werbe!! She is my favorite french teacher and the reason I wanted to become a french minor. She is very smart and cares about her students. She also makes french engaging and fun. In addition, she doesn't assign a lot of busy work and makes sure every student is on the same page in lecture before moving on to another topic. I recommend her!",1
"yvette was so great!  definitely a favorite professor, and she was so good in lecture.  the paper assignments were really easy, and her TA for our class (javier) was very helpful with grading.  he was good looking, as well!  i would definitely take another class with her.",1
Attendance isn't graded but encouraged. His slides are online but he includes info on tests within each lecture. Never actually used the book. My only complaint is that he doesn't usually let you see what you got wrong on the online HW before you take any tests or exams. Kind person and will work with you!,1
I love his class but I am very bad with math. I took statistics because I needed the credit for my major and I refuse to take calculus. His lectures are hard to understand if you havent taken anything statistics similar prior to the class. Tests are basically the review so study the review! Homework is very easy EOO. Pay attention and STUDY!!,1
"Whole class based on readings! You will discuss what you thought about the readings assigned and how certain ideas are applied in teaching so you get a reading response every week, 150 words max but 2 are graded. They're easy, just use quotes to make connections. Interesting lectures and there is one fun group project that you will work a lot on.",1
also read my rating for her on www.virtualratings.com its more extensive,0
"Wonderful teacher!!! She explained the problems and made them easy to understand. We used the online course Aleks, the textbook was never even opened. Homework every night. she offered extra credit if you went to the math lab. I passed with an A!",1
This professor is honestly the worst professor I've ever had. He is very unfair and won't even grade your tests accurately from the university's grading key. Take this professor if you want to be screwed out of not only the grade you deserve but also your hard earned money.,0
"Dr. O is amazing when he teaches lab. He seems to get frustrated, less thorough, and uninterested in lecture. He prepares you for the lecture exams with reviews that he will go over, some of the questions even show up on the test. Reading the book really prepared me for the lecture exam but he does well at preparing you for lab exams so attend!",1
She's a tough cookie. Not rude or mean or anything but she's really disorganized. But not like 'I can't find your paper' more like 'I'm gonna postpone your test for three weeks' Don't be afraid to ask her for help and you most definitely need the book for her tests. She's kinda funny and I like psych so I have enjoyed it so far.,1
"Great professor! Extremely intelligent, yet not overbearing. You must be attentive and see beyond what his line of thought is though. He does not make it immediately obvious what he is getting at, but if you pay attention you can learn a lot. Not the easiest way to learn, but definitely extremely rewarding.",1
Ms. Jackson is THE BEST PROFESSOR AT GCC. I had a fear of taking this class but she really makes it easier and by the end you will become a better speaker. Her class is like one big family. I absolutely loved it. If you need com225 TAKE IT WITH MS JACKSON. you wont regrett it. Shes seriously one of the best teachers I've EVER had.,1
The best professor you can have.,1
"You leave class everyday confused and learn absolutely nothing. You're expected to know what he left off after class. Relies HEAVILY on MyMathLab Homework assingments, which only boosts up your grade by one point. (Don't miss a day on them, it will drop your grade badly!!) Try not to fail any of the four tests, will bomb your grade.",0
"Prof Allen is is very helpful. There is a lot of homework but that was how you studied for tests. So if you get the homework than you are pretty solid. He gives A LOT of extra credit which helps tremendously. Yes you will have to work in this class but it's Calculus. No matter who you take, it is going to be hard for most. Would def take again",1
"Beato is a nice guy but also never seems prepared for lectures. He is equally as surprised with what is on the next slide as you will be. Because of that, he gives off a chaotic vibe and often teaches out of order. That is not to say that he doesn't know the content, once he remembers what he wrote, he can normally explain it pretty well.",1
"Dr. Simms will not cheat you out of an education. If you take his Geology with lab class, and do the requisite work associated with it, you'll walk away with a working level knowledge of how Earth functions. He knows the material intrinsically; he's able to take an extremely complex set of dynamics and make them digestable. I highly recommend him!",1
Great professor and amazing lecture! You can really learn something from his class! Extra credits are very helpful which will boost your final grade a lot.,1
"Andor is a really great professor! I think that he is extremely helpful and a very interesting teacher, bringing excited to the usually boring topics of history!",1
"DO NOT TAKE! As the poster below me said, his exams are IMPOSSIBLE. I studied a minimum of 10 hours for each exam and am struggling to hold a C. Dont bother asking him whats on the exam, he will just send the class an email listing the names of the chapters covered. He doesn't care if people fail and does little to help those struggling.",0
Class was easy and good introduction class to geography. Her lectures had some interesting things that arent found in the textbook and overall the class was easy and she was very understanding when it came to distant learning.,1
This teacher was not helpful at all to me. In my opinion she is not clear at anything she wants and has a hard time pronouncing words which made it very hard to understand her during lectures. I would avoid taking her classes unless you have to.,0
"Shes the best of the best, class isnt boring its fun every time! Shes super nice, shes awesome and you wont regret taking her class.",1
This lady is very unfair!!! she WANTS you to FAIL.  You have to suck up to her hardcore to get anything close to a B. DO NOT TAKE HER!,0
Rick Is by far the most relaxed professor I have had so far in my time hear.He is the type of guy that you could just hang out with and knock a few back. Cool dude and fun course.,1
Nice guy ! Sometimes speaks too fast. Clear in instructions. Tests were were relatively harder.,1
"Majority of the class was failing the entire semester. More than half the class dropped. Not a bad person, but clearly needs to work on establishing clear criteria and realistic expectations given the course level and needs to effectively communicate what they want from the class.",0
No Comments,1
Professor seem like an overall person but when it comes to teaching she needs to be better prepared. While doing examples of new material she often makes mistakes and corrects them midway with unclear explanations of the changes. Good amount of homework on pearson while will require a code $$$ a few quzzies and tests plus final. Find other options.,0
"Very knowledged person on his field, tough class and he will test you very well with various assignments which will make you learn a lot. Very kind and caring person too. Only real problem would be that he is a tough grader and hard on grammar. Interesting to talk to as well.",1
He will give you everything you need to know. Just regurgitate it in a different form and you will be fine. Be specific in your answers.,1
Mr. Wildman is the BOMB! I was horrible at math my whole life  but I passed with a 3.0.  If you have to take a math class at SFCC he's definitely your guy!,1
"Very hard working and enthusiastic. Often frustrating because she assigns work and then forgets it so you spend a lot of time for nothing. But if she remembers then it must be on time. Tries to stimulate interest with ""fun"" things and online materials. Tests are not excessively hard.",1
"great enthusiasm, really encourages participation,makes you really think,which college is about-She has a great career ahead of her-i plan on taking more classes with her-Hope UNO can keep her",1
"Highly recommended professor. Makes an effort to have you connect to the class and material. He's very knowledgeable on the material and interested. Not one of these robot professors who just reads off powerpoints. Key to succeed: Review the class material prior to class, go to class and participate, show up for reviews and ask away.",1
"Professor Shaw is a gem. Her classes are always challenging, yet exciting. She will push you in ways you have never been pushed, and I promise you will come out a stronger person.",1
"Dude this guy rocks, he's easy going and an easy A if you do the work.",1
"I've always learned better when things are explained to me, she doesn't give you any specific reading as to what will be needed for quizzes or tests, you literally have to read the entire chapter, which means you'll eventually end up reading the entire textbook. no reviews are given, no study guides and some of the tests were very difficult.",1
"Extremely nice, very caring, wants you to learn, loves to teach, willing to help, understands that life happens to people, got an A will take again",1
"Don't buy the text book. You will not use it. His grading is ridiculous. He was absurd with grading, he would do one on one sessions for your essays, make corrections, then mark you down on your final draft once completed. Even though he made those changes. Hes absolutely hysterical. Just make sure you're a unicorn in your writing to get just a C",0
Never seemed to respond to my emails so that was tough when an assignment was confusing. Overall the class was pretty easy but it is definitely a lot of tedious work. Same thing every week.,0
"Prof Yang cares about her students and wants them to do good. I appreciate that she gives a lot of opportunities to raise your grade, but ultimately you receive a greater workload. It was reassuring that even if I flunked an assignment, my grade would not entirely suffer. An A grade is definitely achievable (I was 0.3 away).",1
"3-5 pop quizzes throughout the quarter to illicit greater attendance. The ""lectures"" were interesting and the class had a structure where student input was not only encouraged, but valued as well. She assigns a few papers (one being 2000 words); however, she grades very fairly. Just start on it early and you'll be good. The novels are an easy read.",1
I took Mrs. Spencer for Business 100. She was very helpful and easy to work with. I would recommend this class to anyone!,1
"No textbook, just a link to papers he's written about sociologists. Multiple choice questions are really just papers written in response to his writings. A paper a week plus extra book reports. Not engaging, treats you like a child & makes comments if you don't have prep notes for his papers that are written more suitable to an upper level class.",0
test R open book but u do need to study they R not really that easy! but hw counts 150pts so that helps----- & he is supper hot & has great HAIR! but he is married got married spring break 2005 so that sucks,1
This class is a disorganized mess.,0
If you can learn on your own I'd recommend her otherwise if you need a walk through of the information in order to learn find another professor.,0
Kathy is a great professor! She has worked with me get through assignments that I've missed and all in all is a caring person. She explains ideas great. You have to go to class though because her classes are mandatory. Quizzes are online and you have to use the book.,1
Dr. Mike is one of the most amazing teachers you will have the opportunity to have during your time at Michigan. Every day he treated us with respect and made sure to break down the material in a way that made it easier to learn and comprehend. He's hilarious often making the class break out in laughter with his dry humor. Always ready to help!,1
He will not curve the class. Made the course harder than it suppose to be. And does not want to help you in his office hours. Do NOT pick him if you can take it with someone else.,0
"Death & Dying was one of the best courses I have ever taken and that is mostly because of Sara and how she is with the course. She is very much a professor you can talk to during office hours, on her personal cell whenever you need, etc. She also just always has such interesting knowledge and experience when it comes to social work.",1
"Dr. A is a very nice man and I have taken several of his classes but, unfortunately, his teaching style does not suit me.  He explains math with words instead of examples, which is difficult for me and many others. This comment is coming from someone who earned A's in the entire Calculus series.  Avoid his classes if you are a visual learner.",0
"I'm pretty good at English but her class was impossible. She assigned 2 papers every week that had to be 3-4 pages each. I fell behind in all my other classes because the homework took up most of my time. On average I spent between 3-4 hours on each paper. It was also just really confusing, most of the time I felt completely lost and overwhelmed.",1
"Professor Mizell is a very nice lady. But she doesn't teach AT ALL in class, all she does is talk about current events. She hardly ever replies to your emails when you need her to. She does make a good syllabus that is clear and easy to follow. Overall, she's nice but not a very good teacher.",0
"Amanda is an incredible professor and an amazing human being. She really knows her stuff and teaches in a very intense and meaningful way. She is not afraid to be a little tough on slackers, or, uh, really tough. Either way, she's a very powerful teacher. If you have the chance to take a class with her, TAKE IT!!",1
"VERY funny professor, makes everything super clear, and does a great job of relating the topics to his students. Great class!",1
"Arka is a great Professor. The tests are pretty much the same as the sample tests he gives with slightly different problems. The final is 40% of the final grade, otherwise a great professor with a pretty easy class.",1
She is one of the most inappropriate and careless professors I have ever met. She is careless and doesnt care about her students. Take take her classes,0
"Great professor. Her lectures are easy to understand and clear, making her testing very fair. She works with the class if most got an answer wrong she will throw out the question.",1
"Very knowledgeable and helpful. Instills high standards and expects nothing less. If you take her class, you will learn something. Always willing to help those who ask, but is not a doormat for scammers.",1
Okay teacher I guess,1
Mrs. Fountain is a solid choice for public speaking. She is a good teacher and very fair at grading. We had four speeches and three exams and a few smaller projects. The tests are pretty easy and she grades your speeches very generously. She is also pretty quick at grading.,1
"Basically, take this class if you want an A. First test is legit in class, Second is take home, Third is open notes. He ALWAYS has extra credit. He is there to help because he knows the material is difficult. He posts the lectures on blackboard so attendance isn't mandatory.",1
"Very helpful and intelligent!!!  He makes you work hard, but he only does it because he wants you to succeed.  I hope to have him as a professor again!!",1
Turning in essays she would mark out things I would say and add in something that is much longer and unnecessary. So when you take this class be prepared for your essay to be heavily nit picked. An essay that deserves at least an A is actually graded a B and even closer to a C. Keep in mind your finished grade is based solidly on these essays.,0
"Very ambiguous grading and takes off points like crazy on exams. Spits formulas on the board with little to no explanation. Can't clearly answers questions and responds with ""you should know this from a past course"" but almost no one knows. Make sure to copy down the final forms of formulas and try to get past exams to practice b/c he's useless.",0
Just not good take somebody else lame boring. Thompson does a terrible job as a professor he just stands back and does nothing most of the time.,0
"Great teacher - one of the best I've had. Smart, funny and good looking!",1
EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. Rude and unprofessional. If you don't already basically have a masters degree in physics he is going to make you feel stupid. Doesn't care about his students or their comprehension of the material.,0
"Easily one of the worst instructors I have ever had. I had to learn everything out of the book. He would constantly make you feel embarrassed if you failed to grasp the material that he considered easy (outside of lecture he isn't as bad). His lectures were next to useless as his notation was hard to follow, and he spoke in a rambling sort of way.",0
"This class was incredibly easy. She is a great teacher who will help you if you are struggling. The assignments were not difficult at all, the final assignment is a group project and it is not difficult. If you do the work, you will get an A in this class. Most of the extra credit came from in class assignments. You do have to use the textbook.",1
"Take this guy. Not too much homework, and he was my the most caring teacher I had this semester.",1
"Easy weekly short assignments (1-2 pages each)...and one final paper (5-7 pages), and he gives you a list of topics from which to choose. 75% attendance = A for attendance. It's a doable A. And it counts for a second writing requirement for SAS. Take it!",1
Fantastic teacher who engages all students equally.,1
"I remember when she had to cancel class early cuz she got food poisoning, but the fact that she still came to teach--- uh wow.  There are no online hw (thx the lord), instead you get w.s. that are straightforward and helpful for the exams. Quizzes are all online (lowest one being dropped). Take her, loved the way she carries herself and her puns.",1
Good professor,1
"This woman is not organized at all BUT I wouldn't take any other English professor! shes always there to help and if you go to her office for help on a paper, she will fix the whole thing! the text book is mandatory for homework and in class discussions. she gets behind on grading so don't expect to know your grade until after the final.",1
Hard class. Must study and review daily.,1
He was a great teacher. Study the notes he tells you during the review and you will be guaranteed to get a high score. Never skip his class because he will fail you.,1
"The final was ridiculously hard for this class. None of the type of problems on the exam were ever given to the students as homework, practice, or web problems. It's almost like he needed to lower the average grade of the class.",0
"He seemed a little bit strict, but he was funny sometimes. We had 5 2-pg papers that were really easy. He said we were going to have pop quizzes but never got any and the 4 tests were easy if you finished and studied the study guides. I also like his way of grading. The thing that I didn't like was that he never posted the powerpoints on blackboard",1
"Awesome guy! Helpful, and knows his stuff. His class is based on the midterm, the final & attendance. Hs test are really easy and he seems to enjoy what he is talking about. I would really reccomend him. :)",1
"JANA IS A GREAT INSTRUCTOR, AND IS ALWAYS THERE TO HELP YOU OUT, SHE GIVES GREAT FEED BACK, AND YOU CAN ALWAYS GO BACK AND TALK TO HER WHEN YOU NEED EXTRA EXPLAINING ON ASSIGNMENTS.",1
"I liked Professor Perez and the class is easy enough. But his TA's are super arrogant and very disruptive during lecture. One of the TA's is constantly on her laptop during the lecture. Thankfully I had Brian as a TA, he was tough but his discussions were super helpful.",1
The courses I have taken with him are all poorly organized. He would spend one class deriving a formula on the board for you and thinks that he is doing a marvelous job helping you understand. Most of the time he is overcomplicating things making his lectures a waste of time. He has a major stuttering problem and would rather just write equations.,0
"She's great, I just have a hard time grasping languages. I took Spanish fo 7 years and still suck at it, that's why I decided to give Italian a try. She's a great, enthusiastic, young professor. I'd recommend her to anyone.",1
"She is such a wonderful Professor!  So kind and enthusiastic about the material, it is amazing.  She really wants each student to do well and I am so glad to have taken her class.  Truly a great Professor.",1
"Tries to push you to the online website for the book but ended up not using it.  Directions are sometimes confusing.  Don't be silent, ask the question and you will do just fine.",1
I have been taught by Ruchika ma'am in my Bachelor's and believe me she is the best teacher anyone would want.,1
A pretty laid back guy who genuinely loves what he teaches. We had very specific reviews for the 3 tests we had so that made the tests a lot easier. i studied probably an hour for each and had a b+ on all of them so just a little effort goes far. Can get a bit boring though because he mainly just lectures the whole class but i still recommend him.,1
"I had her in JAP 101-103 and LSFY 203 as well. She is possibly one of the easiest teachers I've ever had in college. She's extremely understanding when you turn your homework in late, and her classes are always fun! Last year was her 1st LSFY class and she's never taught something like it before, so She did an excellent job for her 1st time.",1
"Schaal takes tricky concepts and makes them a lot easier to understand. He does an amazing job of finding ways to explain complicated concepts with real life examples.   Tests are hard and theres a lot of homework, but a lot of that is because there's a lot to cover in the class. ",1
Dr Bland actually cares about the classes she teaches. If you need to take a literature course take one of hers.,1
This is the easiest class i have ever taken at KSU. I literally made a 100 in the class. Class is mandatory and the lecture is very long but this is an easy A. Dr. G always extended dates and helped everyone. There are very few asssignments so make sure you do them all. I didnt learn a lot it was basically like a review of math 2008 & 3316. No HW.,1
Great instructor. Definitely take Jon over James Patterson if you're able to.,1
"Dr. Hansen is a great teacher and is very passionate about soils; however, his class doesn't always effectively invite others to feel the same way. If you aren't naturally interested in soils, this class will be tough. The textbook is a very dull read, which doesn't help.",1
"Professor C. Fitzpatrick is an amazing teacher, she cares about all her students. She helps every student in her class become a great writer and makes her students think critically.  Be prepared to write a lot in her class. One word of advice take this class serious because it will definitely  help improve your writing skills.",1
I enjoyed her class a lot.,1
"Without a doubt one of the most intelligent people I have ever met, she is a great professor and it is almost impossible to be bored in her classes",1
"He seems to be a good guy, but he needs to slow down when he's teaching. He goes too fast and often messes up when teaching. Beware of the probability section of this class! It's very difficult. If the class scores below average he'll give EC on the exams.",0
"I couldn't have been blessed with a better professor. I was extremely scared concerning public speaking but with her guidance and encouragement I was able to overcome my fear, gain confidence, & excell in the class. She is always available during and after class. Participate and complete quizzes & you'll pass with out an issue. Great person!",1
"Show up on time, do the weekly worksheet, and pass. It's that easy.",1
Very clear. Don't really need you book til test day and for the 15 EASY assignments. Most of the assignments are you opinions. He is very funny too. I strongly recommend him.TAKE HIM!,1
"Sara is a great teacher! Whether or not you are a social work major, her classes are always really interesting.",1
"hello everyone don't take her class it's big mistake laguardia is doing big mistake to keeping her here and letting her teach psychology classes , she have attitude problem .",0
Awesome class. A lot of group activities ,1
"Since her page hasn't been updated in a while, I wanted to add my opinion. Professor Page tended to be condescending towards students and assigned an inordinate amount of busy work. She spoke to us as if we were children, and her attitude made it hard for me to learn in her class. I got an A, but I did not enjoy my experience.",0
"Sobie basically just takes the entire book, writes every word onto a powerpoint and says good luck. His powerpoints cover way too much unnecessary material so theyre useless, exam reviews are 200 qs, but the exams are only 85. The exams are all too close to eachother to learn that much!! He also grades vaguely!! Do not reccommend!",0
"Great teacher! Really interesting guy and he's really passionate about English and writing. We always had great discussions in class. There are a couple novels you need for the class, but for the most part you read short stories online. Two papers, one midterm test that's pretty easy.",1
"Great teacher!  Very clear, very nice, easy homework, easy tests.  Interesting films chosen.  Just watch, listen and write.  You'll do fine!",1
She is very boring. The first 3 classes have been about GALILEO and research. She seems to mean well but her teaching style is so bad. She tells long unimportant stories that arent relevant to the course. Best part is the open text/ open google tests. Shes really liberal about device usage. Dont ask questions cause shell go off on a tangent.,0
"Never a boring class, you do get a lot of work but everything you do is helpful and essential to getting a good grade on the essays. Readings can get a little overwhelming for some, but it wasn't a problem for me. Her class does require a lot of time outside class, but if you fulfill all the requirements and ask for help you will pass",1
"I took CIS 298AB ""Special Project"" from Dr. Storeslee. He was a good teacher and the class was very self-paced. He was good and staying in communication and a fair grader. I sat in on the first few minutes of one of his classes, super fair, funny an open-minded.",1
Professor Holmes is a wonderful teacher. I always look forward to attending her class. She's very funny and also very helpful.,1
Tests were almost nothing like material covered in lecture. He rarely went by the textbook and seemed very disorganized.  This class was unnecessarily difficult because of him.,0
"Cultural Anthropology was a good class. Dr. Prussing really incorporates interesting topics such as sushi, body art, and societal taboos. Her lectures are a bit boring, due to poor presentation of the info. Overall average course, the grading criteria seemed a bit more intense than what I thought was necessary, but the content was interesting.",1
"Professor List is great! He is very caring and honestly if you do the work before lecture, he will reiterate on the topic, so you can take better notes. All homework can be turned in earlier and there were no in class quizzes. The tests are curved and it is honestly everything you read. Two take home exams and for the final, we choose the question!",1
"Tries to be the cool professor, but fails. He fails because he relies almost entirely on PowerPoint and reads off the slides. He often gets lost in his own notes and will just talk without clicking through the slides then finish the lecture and realize clicking through all of them at the end. Ineffective, test-heavy, and unfunny. Avoid if possible.",0
"I was not happy with Mrs. Dudleys teaching. Her lectures are pretty bland, and her grading was very hard. Her labs are rushed and take forever. I would not recommend taking this class if you're looking for an easy A...",0
"Love Dr. McCullagh! He is very knowledgeable and has done so many amazing things in his life! If you get the chance to speak with him one on one, take it!",1
"He's such a brilliant mind! Granted, this class isn't easy; it requires a lot of reading and intellectual reflection. However, Falcon (doesn't seem it but) is very approachable. He has an unmatched passion for teaching, and expects students to step up. He's certainly shaped my way of viewing the world, and I'm taking another class with him.",1
"Very good instructor. Challenges us, but is helpful. Highly recommend taking a class with Prof. Judge.",1
"About 45% of a math final made up of impossible T or F. Comes to class with no preparation. Most of the time students finish the problem for him. Never explains any terminology, yet expects us to know it for the exams. Likes to put on tricky problems. Won't take the time to answer questions. Kinda cocky in the British way. I def wouldn't recommend.",0
"Amazing guy & Professor! Course material super interesting, highly recommend this course & anything he teaches. Weekly writing statements (pretty easy),midterm essay questions (ques. told in advance),2 papers, final take-home exam -> Overall probably the best course I've taken at Umass and in Soc dept course reccom to soc majors,premeds, & anyone!!",1
Couldn't understand a thing he talked about all semester. Doesn't help his students. Horrible. He will let you out early but thats about it. You can go to all the tutoring in the world and show up to his classes. Even when he clearly sees your trying he wills till fail you. Avoid.,0
"Alynn was a great prof for KIN 150. She was always willing to help students with anything they were struggling with and broke down theories/movements to make them easier to understand. She was available to meet outside of class, and grades practical exams based on what you are capable of, not in comparison with other people in the class.",1
"For the school he is at he was difficult. I have taken five classes from him at this point and have learned so much. He's unique in his approach, but definitely have respect for him, even if I don't always agree with him.",1
Dr. Strait is one of the best professors I've ever had. He has the best stories and never ending knowledge of music.,1
"I enjoy Hensley's lectures. I tend to slack off and not pay attention in most classes, but I really enjoy listening. He always gives good examples and stories throughout the class period.",1
"I love Dr. Oakley as a person, but this class is very hard for non geology majors. There are SO many opportunities to bring your grade up from the tests throughout the semester, but if you don't get As on those it can stop you from doing well in the class.",1
"Professor Faux was super chill and I really wish I was able to take this class with him in person because it wouldve been even better than it already was. Exams are open note, so if you pay attention and take notes its an easy A.",1
"Br. Daniel must be protected at all costs. He's very easy to listen to during lectures, is endearing, and explains things well. It's a pretty easy class as well. 10/10 would recommend for CMP.",1
"Honestly didn't learn much out of the class, but he's a really funny guy to listen to.  He expects a lot of basic/trivial details in his test answers that you wouldn't think you'd need to provide; so be very very very thorough.",1
Professor Freeman is one of the best profs I've ever taken at UW. He is very caring and understanding of students lives' and lectures are super clear + he's enthusiastic and cute LOL. Class is based on a few assignments and group project. Available if you need him. The class was hard as a beginner new to coding but he is very approachable,1
"She's so sweet! She's very understanding, and takes a great deal of time to help stuudent's to make sure they understand the material.",1
"One of the best professors I've had, especially since we transitioned online because of the pandemic. Very accessible by email and office hours. Great lectures and wants to help students understand the concept. The test and subject itself isn't easy, and his tests do challenge you. However, if you put in the effort, it's a very rewarding class.",1
"Fuentes is one of the best professor I've had. He's always willing to go the extra mile to make sure you understand the material. Lectures are a fresh breath of air, you can tell he genuinely cares about his students and what he teaches us. Super passionate about his teachings and always willing to help and answer questions.",1
IF YOU LIKE YOUR LIFE AND VALUE YOUR TIME DO NOT EVEN LOOK AT THE NAME JOANNE HOUSTON.... THE SMALLEST MOST MICROSCOPIC THOUGHT OR CONSIDERATION OF TAKIN A CLASS WILL DESTROY THE LEFT SIDE OF YOUR BRAIN SHE FAILED 28 OUT OF 30 PPL IN MY CLASS...SHE IS ILLOGICAL AND CONFUSED WITH HER OWN LIFE MUCH LESS TO HAV TIME TO CATER TO YOURS..DON'T DO IT!!!!!,0
"Great Professor. Super Knowledgeable, tons of real experience, very fair, has good sense of humor, I would take him again for sure.",1
Amazing teacher! Very caring.,1
"I really liked Mr. Goodman. His voice is a bit monotone, but if you participate and pay attention, the material is relatively interesting. The information came easily to me. His notes are online and his final is comprehensive, but he let us use our notes.",1
"Take this Professor!!! He is so nice and allows you to express yourself in your writing, which was my favorite. He doesn't expect a lot from students so his class is easy but I got to actually enjoy it. Take this class, you wont regret it",1
LOved her class,1
"He is funny but you can't deny his holier-than-thou attitude. He used to disregard me in office hours and participation because he genuinely enjoys humiliating a student who volunteers to contribute in class. Also I once asked him to review my bugged code and he scuffed at me ""your attempt isn't good enough for a rudimentary problem"" So opinionated",0
"2% chaque cours pour les travaux d'équipe en classe, mais on en a fait a peut près 5 max, donc 2% facile à chaque cours (pour un total de 20%). Il n'est pas très pédagogue. Ce que j'ai le moins aimé c'est qu'il va plus vite que ce que prévue au plan de cours et donc lorsque l'on prend un peu de retard dans les exercices c'est difficile à suivre.",0
"Nothing. Not only did she give me attitude on the first day of the semester, but also falsely accused me and a classmate who is also my best friend of cheating on an exam, by asking us what's up about our scantrons in front of the entire class. I have never felt so humiliated and disrespected by anybody like this ever.",0
Her feedback is precious. Awesome lectures. Hard grading but valuable.,1
"CIT 120 ONLINE was very easy. You read the chapter and take as many practice tests as you want. Then, you take the actual test which gives questions FROM the practice tests. Teacher is very organized and grades projects right away. I use the material I studied in this class everyday at work. I love it! Defeinitely recommend online!!!",1
"Amazing proffersor! He's always interesting in making you better at times he has that ""you should this by now"" attitude but if you don't he'll help you out. Just drink your coffee (can be a bit boring if you're feeling tired) but over amazing proffersor! Love him",1
"Great professor, makes class as interesting as possible, uses relevant pop culture to convey larger ideas about religion and make them more accessible.",1
"makes you do reflections which are pointless, just teach the class IN LECTURE! the exams are so hard, nothing like homework, I think I failed this class, being my first failed class ever. Retaking with a different teacher, dont care. Awful. Nice guy, but doesnt care if you are failing. No extra credit at all. Makes you do pointless papers.",0
"She is an awesome professor that will answer any and all questions you have. She is an easy A as long you do the work in a timely manner. I am taking her again for biology 2. When it comes to her labs, she will go over everything with students before. Also, DO THE STUDY GUIDES!! Print them out during lecture and use them as notes, IT HELPS SOO MUCH",1
"Great professor, I highly recommend her. Organized, gives extra credit, and things are spaced out well. Don't procastinate and just make sure to follow deadlines.. Weekly quizzes and four discussion papers. I learned a lot about how to eat right. You do get what you put into it.",1
"This Professor is epic. Instead of memorizing bunch of scientific names, he wants you to learn how to think and apply the practical knowledge. He is a true modern science Professor. He is very patient, polite, has a sense of humor, and intelligent. His lab is more like a club rather than a class. It is very entertaining.",1
"Ms. Zimmerman is a nut, but in the best way. Always enjoyed listening to her teach, however- this class is impossible if you don't have previous exposure to an anatomy class in high school. The tests were multiple choice but the questions often had nothing to do with her powerpoint. There was only 1 midterm and 1 final but labs are key- know APA!!",1
"terrible professor ever. Vague criteria, thinks shes a good professor, and ignore students. Let me just say this, DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS. YOU WILL REGRET JUST LIKE ME.",0
I've always been good at English and writing. This teacher grades hard so do not expect anything higher than a B. I would never take her again.,0
"Very helpfull teacher, just do 3 presentations. Ur guaranteed to pass the class if u do the presentations and online work that is due at the end of the semester!! I recommend him to anyone.",1
I took her course online for a minim-ester and it was very easy. The homework and quizzes were very easy and she gives enough time to do. Easy A if you everything as she says. We did not use book. Definitely Recommend!,1
"One of the best classes I have ever taken. If given the opportunity, take a Drake class. He will make you think in ways you never have before. I have my criticisms but overall it was more than worth taking. It is a bit difficult, but your mind will grow. Do the extra seminar if you want to get to know some very smart people.",1
"Very few examples are given in class. You need to read the textbook prior to the lecture to make the most out of the lecture. Dr. Wang is very informed and will answer any question you have,  so come prepared! Homeworks are assigned every week and it's not something you want to do the day before, unless you want to spend 8-10 hours working on it.",1
Best professor I have ever had in my entire life!  Took him for both 351 and 352,1
She is a awesome teacher!!! she explains things in a way that you can understand. She shows several ways to work the problem so that you can find which way is best for you. She gives plenty of chances for extra credit and the quizes and tests aren't hard at all! I would recomend her to anyone!,1
The class was extremely difficult. Extra credit was given sometimes in class randomly. There were a couple group projects with your lab benches. I studied so much for her tests and read the textbook but still got around 60-70s on her test. There's a lot of grades though so it doesn't hurt your average extremely bad. You need to put in work.,0
"Class has a lot of homework, but it's worth doing it if you want to learn. She's a great teacher because she explains everything thoroughly.",1
"Love this professor! Dr Ferreira is smart, funny and gives great feedback. She wants students to succeed, and explains all literature and assignments in great detail to make sure it's understandable.",1
I took his course at Carleton and loved it! Interesting coursematerial and fantastic discussions. And he is great prof with a heart of gold.,1
"Professor Birbaum is  laid back & easy going. He gives a ton of extra credit. Lectures are mostly done by guest speakers, which are interesting. Grades are based around homework work sheets (a lot end up being EC), exams (on Blackboard) and practical exams which are take home work sheet packets & short formal report.  Easy A, would take again.",1
"300 word reflection due every week and lots of lectures and films to watch. good teacher and semi-interesting class but it feels like a lot of work for a gen ed. Easy A if you do all the required work and all the quizzes are online if you're struggling. ALSO do not buy the book, it's online for free with various websites.",1
"Monotone voice, gives long lectures before and at the end of class. Talked all class period once and then made the class stay after to draw. Gives a lot of homework assignments, and rarely gives A's.",0
"If you're not already good at sight reading while singing, you're in for a hard time. I was sick for my final and she failed me without letting me re-do it when I was better. She's super harsh with how she grades your singing, even though not all of us are choir people. And even choir people had a hard time. I cried after this class.",1
"Dont buy textbook. There are 3tests, mathxl hw/quiz grade and final exam. She really cares about her students and is willing to help. I would definitely take her again.",1
Exam is based on a set of questions handed out in the beginning. Material is very difficult and his style of teaching makes it more complicated. Case study presentations must be very detailed.,0
"Mr.K is a great teacher and really fun to be a part of his class. When he tells you to write something down, it will be on the test.",1
"Great teacher!this class makes you look at movies differently,gives you a study guide for all her test,papers are clearly explained,her project is a breeze..take this class!highly recommended!",1
Prof. Zeman is the best.  She gives handouts and her tests are on what she taught. She answers all questions and always helps if you have any questions or issues.  I highly recommend taking any of her courses.  I'm taking her again for micro this summer.,1
"This class was awesome. The lectures are so interesting and he's good at ensuring you understand the material.  His test format is great - you get to take the same test three times and he gives feedback each time to help you master each topic. Due dates did change a bit, but wasn't his fault and was always to give us more time. Def take this class!",1
"Prof. Mark is very nice and caring. Her lectures can be boring at times, but she tries to implement group activities to make it more enjoyable. On the other hand, she grades the group project deliverable way too hard. We spent 3 hours on a project(via zoom) & she gave our group a 40(COVID-19). Advice is to take the projects/deliverables seriously.",1
"She is an incredible proffesor, her lectures were always clear and got to the point . She has office hours on a weekly basis. She allows you to turn in late work because she prefers you to truly understand your work and she allows test points to be made up by doing corrections.",1
Very cool professor- very liberal. Knows a LOT about the subject matter. Studies affirmative action. He just needs to speak louder in class- he has a lullaby type voice. But he is good. You will learn a lot in any of his classes. Definitely recommend him. Brings other perspectives into the class and holds time for valuable discussion.,1
"DIFFICULT. DOESNT USE POWER POINTS VERY MUCH. KINDA JUST RAMBLES MAKING IT HARD TO REALLY KNOW WHAT TO STUDY, OVERALL HE ISNT TOO BAD,",0
"One of the best math teachers ive ever hard. Math has always been such a hard subject for me, and for the first time since middle school, I was able to get an A in math. Also allowed us to have formula sheets for the tests which saved my life. Defentially recommend taking him!",1
":( Im usually an honor roll student. taking this class makes me feel like Im dumb. There is a quiz every class period and hes not clear on whats on them. Even when he is, they are next to impossible to get 100%. It could be me, but personally I would not recommend this class. Solid 0/10.",0
"He's a really cool teacher, he'll talk about pretty much everything. He's really layed back and relaxed. He's pretty funny too.",1
never take him stay away.  useless professor.,0
"Veve is great professor. His lectures can be boring and are even pointless at times, but he really cares about his students. He's very flexible when it comes to office hours, and he seems to do everything possible to help his students succeed. I didn't read the textbook much, but I did the study guides for each chapter which was enough to ace tests",1
This class was the most enjoyable in my opinion and I have been with DMACC for close to four years now! She was very responsive and understanding. The books she assigns are great in terms of history of humor seen through literature. She also adds a few video assignments as well! Tons of reading but it is to be expected for a literature course.,1
"He is a nice guy  but lectures are long and boring and he goes off on tangents too often to follow. Exams are tough based mostly on what he says in class, hard to know what to study.",0
"sweet lady, some boring music, but overall fun class.",1
"To help everyone out DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR!!! I went into Farmingdale to get amazing grades and he made my GPA so much lower. He talks very low , when sitting in the back you can barely hear him. The Exams are VERY heavy so if you want to do good make sure you read everything he posts on blackboard. Like I said DO NOT TAKE HIM.",0
"Matthew is hands down the best instructor I've had so far at PSU, and I've had some pretty great teachers here. He gives a damn and isn't afraid to show it and to call out the class when they pretend that they don't. He is funny, supportive, clear, and compassionate. Take his class!!",1
"class is easy. tests are online. essay was a final, open notes. she is very nice and knowledgable but I feel like I didn't learn too much from this class. If anything, my spanish got worse. This class isn't a grammar course, but we didn't learn anything. culturally yes, we did learn a bit, but she was boring at times too. never uses a syllabus.",0
"Beg. Japanese I was hard for a beginner student. Hiragana is basically required for the tests, study it before class starts. A lot of the in-class is speech. Study writing outside of class, at least for four hours. Vocab quizs will always have a mixture of easy words and words you didn't study. Some words do appear on future tests.",1
"Awesome professor! Great lectures! He makes difficult material so easy to understand. Not having an A in his class, would honestly require active self sabotage, because he gives SO many extra credit opportunities. He cares so much about his students.",1
i was scared to approach her in the class ... the course work was very heavy shes a nice professor but that class was not for me,0
Words cannot describe how horrible this class is.She is completly unprofessional and dedicated in a cultish way to a belief system that shapes the entire class. readings were absurd and yoga useless. ruined the entire discipline for me. i am ashamed that a university like Duke supports this kind of shoddy teaching. AVOID AT ALL COSTS,0
she very good .I was intimidated by math before I got in her class but now bring it on,1
Extremly boring class. She is very unorganized. Tough Grader. Missed class quite a few times.,0
"Expect to have to teach yourself absolutely everything on your own time, which is extra difficult because everything you research will be in a different (and more standardized and sensible format) than what she teaches. I have yet to meet a single person who thinks she is good at teaching material. Tests and quizzes are also obscenely difficult.",0
"He seems so nice at first but grading is very harsh, answers to the CM Exerc can be correct but if its not what he is looking for, well too bad he aint giving you a point! Class was via Zoom,he requires cameras and mics at all times for attendance. I dropped after two weeks,it was too much work. PLEASE dont take this class, there are other options!",0
"Mackellar is one of the kindest teachers I've ever had. Even though it was online, he was still upbeat and positive. Class was easy. Simple 2 page paper due every week based off of 5 readings. The readings were primary, so they were difficult to read, but he graded easily and the papers were easy to write. 2 exams & they are straight from lecture. ",1
On the first day he said half the class would drop by the middle of the term.. he was right. If he knows half will drop he should make a change so that doesn't happen. Not a good teacher and wouldn't recommend!,0
"Dr Avila is the best professor that I have ever had. Her class isn't hard if you pay attention to her lectures, study prior to the tests and do the work. She does offer some extra credit which helps a lot. Its important to attend her class because you could miss important info. There are quizzes everyday but they aren't hard and help prepare you.",1
"This was perhaps one of the best teachers I had while getting my degree. Very professional and available to answer questions when I needed a quick response. English 2, as expected, is a good deal of reading and writing; however, he made the grading criteria clear and the essays were actually fun to do. Take this teacher and you will do well.",1
"This professor is inspiring.  She really knows her material.  Well, she should; after all, she has her PHD! This alone can take 8 years.  The class is easy to get a B in for sure, without reading the texts.  They just boost you up to A+ :)",1
"Professor Barden is passionate about accounting. Unfortunately, I am not. Class was 3 hours long and it sure felt like it. Otherwise, Professor Barden is straight forwards with his work and grading. Come to class, try you best to pay attention and it's an easy A.",1
"Would walk into class and say turn in papers, but other than mentioning things generally he never make clear what was due when. Turned in weekly journal entries but none were graded till the end and gave zeros for half of the entries because he said they ""were not MLA format"" but they were the same format as entries he scored as 100.",0
"It was an online math class, so you have to really be dedicated. A LOT of homework. I think he wrote the book he uses and it's very easy to understand. A little slow on getting grades back, but overall a pretty easy class as long as you are willing to put in a lot of time.",1
"Morra is extremely passionate about his field and is very enjoyable to have as a teacher. His lectures are clear, detailed and easy to understand. Only two tests, a mid-term and a final, both of which are essays. Puts his powerpoints up online for you to look at whenever. Easy to pass, provided you give your best effort. Definitely recommend.",1
"Mrs. Roche was very nice, but her class was very frustrating. The TIA tests are hard, but I used quizlet and passed them with As. She focuses more on Microsoft Office, but she does not really help you unless you look desperate. Taking this class online or with a different professor will save you a lot of time.",1
"Intimidated by him at first, but he grows on you quickly because he is so overwhelmingly supportive of you and wants you to succeed. There was a LOT of work, but I have never learned so much in a class. He was a fair grader and explains any mistakes you make. His class really prepares you for Soc270 & up! Hold on to the textbook, it helps later!",1
"he is a very good professor and the assignments are better than other professors (easy and scoring), he gives you feedback that why he deducted the number with a full explanation. will take this prof in future if possible",1
"She's a sweetheart, but very very brutal when it comes to marking and testing. One hundred percent, she gives excellent criticism, but you need passionate effort and a very strong use of creative writing components in order to receive an A on her assignments. Good Luck to all you taking her",1
If you think organic chemistry is hard you thought wrong. This class content is easy but the professor needs to work on his presentation and come up with his lecture instead of reading off the slides word for word. If that were the case might as well just take this class online.,0
Great teacher! Get in her class before it fills up!,1
"The course is difficult to follow, those cencept just do not make sense. The slides are terrible to review. Prof never responses your email, and there is no clue whether we should submit the before class exercies or not, while how those exercies fill into participant point is unknown. Just do not take this course with this prof",0
"Professor Wood is just amazing overall! I was really indecisive at first when choosing a professor for my Comstd 2 class because I saw mixed reviews but I'm really glad I chose her. She wants you to succeed! There are 3 speeches, 3 exams, a few quizzes (about 4) and the homework is really easy. Remember to practice, practice, practice!!!!",1
i loved him he was very understanding about attendence as long as you kept up with the work he was a funny guy very nice. he offered extra help to anyone who needed it. he even let us work together on the final if we had a problem with a question. very easy class,1
"She is very quick to get smart with you.  Her work doesnt make sense, she expects things that are sooooo stupid to be crystal clear. if you leave class early, she takes off points. No book....cant enter class.  its like high school...even worse, middle school.",0
She is all over the place. She loves talking about myths and wants the class to love it to. There are 4 essays. She grades them with an open mind. She is easily impressed. In class you hardly do anything and leave early every time. You are supposed to read books but I never read them and got As on the essay. Easy going and easy to pass.,1
"Maiocco. (or Maureen) is a very organized professor. There is no excuse for any late deadlines,because she gives you PLENTY of warning(first day) No reason not to Ace class unless you're unintrested and or lazy.I graduated her from her degree program.",1
Great teacher. If you have any questions she is more then willing to help you. Makes information applicable to real life situations. This class helps alot with Biomechanics and Motor learning.,1
Do the readings and the quizzes and participate in discussion. The midterm and final are pretty straightforward.,1
"She really sends you out of the class if you are 5mins late.I narrowly passed this class,before every test she gives a handout of what would be on the test. but don't let that fool you,if you do not answer in her own words she marks you down,so you are basically studying to fail. I do not recommend her at all. I felt like i was still in high school",0
"For anyone saying that Professor Fernandes is ""hard"" probably took PSY 100 looking for an easy A, but that's just not how this classroom is run. She actually cares about the material and cares that her students actually leave her class knowing the material. Of all the adjunct professors I've taken in the psych department, she is by far the best.",1
"This is an awesome professor. The class is very difficult, but he trys very hard to make sure you understand. Participation is very important in this class so, being shy won't help you at all.  He is very nice, encourages student questions, and he's hott!",1
"So far my favorite communication course and instructor. She is so down to earth and willing to help students. While this class was writing intensive - it was a lot of work but still enjoyable. If you have to take this class, definitely take it with her!",1
"DO NOT take this professor. He often confuses himself when he's lecturing, which of course confuses the class. He had to make corrections to his poppers several times because the right answer was not even an answer choice. He made something as simple as algebra extremely difficult. Wish i had better things to say...",0
Great professor for history. Clear with what she wants you to learn. She gives you exactly what is on the test before hand and reviews it offering extra credit. There was 4 primary source papers that she grades really easy. ,1
No Comments,0
Awesome prof and very interesting lectures. She takes times to explain assignments and gives clear instructions. Her lectures are not written though so good to have a buddy and never miss class.,1
So caring and kind. You can tell how much she loves what she does and it shines through her. I had been in the hospital for a while and she checked on me constantly and was there for me when I needed to get caught up. She tells you exactly what will be on her tests. If you fail this class it is completely your fault. She gives multiple chances.,1
"Professor McCormick was very understanding and quick at responding. Her class is very easy if you don't fall behind. It's an easy A if you do what you need to do. She has a few projects, quiz's and 2 exams throughout the class. Sometimes it can be a lot of reading but most times she provides a lot of Power Points, which are helpful.",1
The class is normally a community class yet this year it wasn't. Didn't give any test but your grade is made up of the writing you turn in. Not the hardest grader on essays. It was a very easy class. He does not follow the syllabus and we did not use the book. Over all the class is very essay just a lot of writing to do.,1
"This professor just does not seem to have any knowledge on teaching. He is extreamly unorganized, and you just cannot follow what he is saying. Honestly I don't think he has any intrest in his students.",0
"Wastes time on stuff not on exam. Forces you to talk in class. Rarely available for help, either doesn't answer email or takes a week, does NOT show up to open office hours. Takes forever to grade things - had over a month to mark a test and paper worth 40%, but only let us know marks day of the final.  Have to take his class? Skip, read the text.",0
Dr. Feige is an awesome prof! He's really good at teaching difficult material and is very nice and approachable. I learned a lot from him. I just wished I had Dr. Feige for boil 151.,1
"He is a good teacher and an entertaining lecturer, but he gives you a list of problems and does not assign graded home work. the only things that count towards your grade are tests and quizzes. You have to really put in the effort and take it upon yourself to practice the material.",1
"DOES NOT TAKE FEEDBACK WELL, IS NOT CLEAR ABOUT EXPECTATIONS, MAKES UP HER OWN ""CLASS STANDARDS"" AND TRIES TO PASS THEM OFF AS STANDARDS FOR THE PROGRAM, TESTS ARE POORLY WRITTEN AND HAVE MULTIPLE ERRORS ON THEM, DOES NOT TAKE ACCOUNTABILTIY FOR HER MISTAKES ie WILL TEACH ONE THING (CLEARLY LISTED IN POWER POINTS) AND WILL MARK IT WROONG ON TEST.",0
"Great teacher that tried his best to make the class interesting. A lot of group projects, straightforward lectures, and very reasonable exams with no surprises. Very curt and monotoned humor which had the class cracking up. Overall, an easy class with a decent amount of manageable work. Definitely take him. ",1
I honestly don't know where these reviews are coming from. She is one of the worst teachers here at SUNY Geneseo and wouldn't be surprised if she got fired. Her lectures are VERY boring and she doesn't teach you a single thing. Be prepared for living hell...,0
"Dr. Hinton is funny and kind and always keeps the class hyped but she messed up my grades and I kept checking them but she didnt put them in until after grades were due and I was supposed to end up with a 89 B but somehow I ended up with a C on my transcript. If youre going to take her class, CHECK YOUR GRADES WITH HER TO SEE IF THEY ARE CORRECT",1
I absolutely loved her and loved this math class. She was absolutely an amazing math teacher. She was my first math professor at college and I ended  up taking her again another semester best decision ever. If u put in the work you will pass if you ask questions she will answer and she also extra help class available. Would take her again,1
Absolutely terrible and incredibly condescending. Refuses to meet outside of class and makes fun of you when you dont understand,0
best writing teacher so far! I love him ... his teaching style is really good! take him!!!,1
"She is an awesome teacher. Designs her class without tests. Just makes sure youre always present and have the notes done. All her class is on is discussions of the chapters. She calls on you and expects you to answer and if not then you get a zero. Shes super nice, but i hope you like to talk.",1
not a good teacher avoid at all cost. oh believe me..,0
Dr. Griffin is really helpful and kind! She draws from lots of different sources to teach the material effectively and incorporates strategies we can use in our own classes someday.,1
"Very simple online class. Textbook is mandatory. 7 tests ranging from 60-80 questions. Must attend 1 concert report that is 5 questions. 3 modules of homework every week that are very simple, quick, and easy. Taken online during summer.",1
"LOVED Mr. Allen. He gets a bad rap from people that don't do their work, but if you do your work and go to class then you will easily make an A. The test are straightforward and reflect what we do in class. Really like that he gives us worksheets to do outside of class, and will occasionally give extra credit to those that completed. Take him!!",1
"Miller is respectful, kind and invested in the success of each of her students. Your effort in her class is a good reflection of your final grade. She is also very understanding if you need extra help.",1
"Professor Zank is really awesome. His class is quite lecture heavy and attendance is mandatory, but he makes the class very interesting. He's very passionate about what he's teaching and it's very inspiring because he's doing something that he loves.",1
"I took organic 2 and chem 101 Kiesewetter. A lot of people like her because she is bubbly in comparison to other chemistry professors. However, she is not a good teacher. I learned all the material on my own, and she is not very helpful with explaining things. She will just go through problems and expect people to conform to how she does things.",0
"Interesting class, she knows her stuff",1
"I really like how enthusiastic Humphrey is, but his lectures are straight out of the textbook. He also posts his lectures online, so if you miss, it's easy to catch up. His study guides are ONLY FOR THE OPEN ANSWER QUESTIONS. So make sure you study all your notes. I hate the tests, but the essays are easy. Get ready to read a book on communication.",1
"Really nice teacher. Class can be boring seeing as he reads off the powerpoint, but he will be helpful if you have any questions. He is a CPA so he is knowledgeable in the material, just has no teaching skills. Tests & assignments are simple, class is a breeze! Easy A!",1
"Bring caffeine to class or you'll fall asleep pretty quick.  Dr. Self is ok, he'd probably be a cool guy out of this boring class.  You might spend every class wondering what is going on but it's do-able.",0
"She's pretty good doing lectures. She makes them interesting and entertaining. However there is a TON of iclicker points every week so make sure you go to lecture. Also, there is a lot of homework online. But overall, the course was very easy to manage.",1
"STOR 435 is a hard class, so be prepared for that when you sign up with Pipiras. Nonethess, I personally think he does a great job. There are homeworks due every class that make sure that you keep up to date with what he's teaching. He also gives quizzes so there are lots of grades and not just midterms.",1
Takes weeks to go over one chapter then when its time from an exam he crams things and tells your read the textbook. dont take his class,0
Amazing teacher and all around great person! He really wants his students to learn about computers and makes every efforts to make sure you get an A. Very fair and funny! Gives cool sites everyday....be careful they can be addictive! :) Take him!!! You won't regret it :),1
Took him for calc 1 online and it was pretty easy. Use online sources for extra help and it makes the class alot easier as the book can be confusing. There is homework each week A mid-term and a Final. Dont miss the hoework becuase once it closes you can submit it again.,1
Buck is the best!! He helps students during every session with problems and his test only have one or two surprises-such as new problems. I would enroll in his class again. I am ready for Calc III thanks to his rigorous problem solving and help during his office hours.,1
I enjoyed the class and the lectures. He tried very hard to help his students succeed and unfortunately because the students were lazy Mr. Conta didn't lecture as much toward the end of the semester which I didn't like as much. I really benefited from what he had to say. Keep it up Conta you're a great teacher!,1
"I love professor Ball! He's the best!!! If you need Math 0308 Please do yourself a favor and pick his class. He makes everything so easy, he's funny, he cares about our time, he has lots of patience, and makes everything easy and clear for you.",1
"Great prof., lots of knowledge and is excited about his students learning.",1
"This professor is knowledgeable and gives feedback which is helpful to students who are trying to improve and learn. She is also responsive and will give clear direction on how and when the homework should be done. Participation matters, of course, but it is not overwhelming( like in some other classes).",1
I am taking his asynchronous class and it is going very well. His videos on YouTube are very helpful. If he makes mistakes he will not penalize the class for it. For our first test it was hard to finish because of the time limit. So when he graded it he dropped some of the questions. So never worry that he will not grade fairly. Hw is on webassign.,1
"I took MAT 099 and MAT 121 with Miss Dashley. She is an amazing teacher and I wish I could take more of my future math classes with her. She was always enthusiastic, presented her ideas clearly, and took the time to answer any questions we had.  She clearly loves math and wants to share that with her students. ",1
"She knows a lot about this topic. I advise everyone to take this class due to the algorithms taught are real life stuff. Start coding early and ask her for explanations. She cannot write code well. It reminds me of a CS102 student. Besides that, cool class.",1
Isabelle was the lab instructor for this course. It was online due to covid. It didn't seem like she was very considerate of the struggles of online learning. Lab assignments took at least a whole day to complete and the information/instructions would be scattered across multiple pdfs and brightspace pages.,0
"If you don't like writing and want an easy A, pick another class. However, if you want to improve your writing tenfold (and eliminate the use of cliché in your papers), then take this class. There are some quizzes on the assigned reading material, and lectures are coupled with in-class debates.",1
"Great teacher, great course. Highly recommended.",1
This is the second class I've taken with Dr. Richmond and she's the best! Although this was only an online class I still had a wonderful experience with her. She's the reason I'm so interested in Psychology (even though I'm an art history major). She makes the material easy to understand and gives the funniest lectures. Great professor!,1
"Glenn Smith is, simply put, an angle of a man. Truly passionate about constitutional law, he genuinely cares about the education of each of his students. Participate in his class and he'll appreciate it. I am taking him in a course simulating the Supreme Court, smaller than his usual lectures, and he is very accommodating. Funny too!",1
awesome teacher. take her!,1
Doesn't explain things well in order for you to get a really good grade in this course. A calculator is not allowed! Better be excellent at Math or you probably won't pass. Majority of students dropped his class and one student switched her degree because of this professor!!! HORRIBLE WOULD NOT EVER RECOMMEND TO ANYONE!! TAKE SOMEONE ELSE!!!!,0
"Dr. Luttrell is a nice, Christian man, and is willing to help students out by giving them publication and research opportunities.  Teaching isn't his strong point, however.  Combine the PowerPoint slides with studying the book to succeed, fairly easily.  Make a template for lab reports to save you time.",0
I had Doug for three classes & each were a great experience!  He is good at what he does & extremely helpful in teaching his students.  My favorite teacher at NMC... highly recommended!,1
Tom is a really tough grader that cares a lot about his students. SOC 206 is the reason I am a better writer today. Since SOC 206 I have taken multiple other classes with Tom.,1
"She makes math easy, understandable, and very straightforward. The key to her lessons are the notes she gives us. She takes the time to make and print out the notes for us. I honestly had an easier time understanding math because of her notes; they're very organized and basically everything you'd need to know. I would only want to take her for math",1
"Santosh is a great teacher and has accomplished a lot in his field. He was super passionate to help us learn everything and was ready to give us great ideas to push our projects forward. Sometimes, he's get carried away and teach us something way out of our skill set, but that just showed his passion for teaching. He made things fun and interesting",1
"I mean I will take him again.. but this guy is super moody his mood swings are unbelievable. He can go from nicest person to the meanest person!  Honestly, his accent is the only thing that kept the class alive.",1
"He doesn't follow his syllabus and has trouble connecting with his students on an educational level. He will talk endlessly about a subject without allowing students enough hands-on experience, which inevitably bites you in the ass when the end of the semester rolls in and he realizes you've done .5/10 of his intended projects. Nice & funny though.",0
"There is no textbook needed and a lot of short readings.  Three exams with option of 1 exam being an essay which can be turned in several times to improve grade.  Hardest part is 5 question, 5 minute weekly quizzed due to the time part of it.  Be prepared to read for sure.  Very fair grader and truly wants you to be better at analyzing literature",1
"Like other negative reviews, he does give pop quizzes and is a bit rude, however Lab class is Lab and his lecture doesn't really matter as you need to memorize the lab lists and models for the exams. Hes pretty much there for any extra info you need but 99% of Lab is just memorizing the lists and models",0
"Danielle Miller is really passionate about her class. I learned a lot and my writing has definitely improved. If you want to learn and not just pay for a class, but actually get your money's worth, then this is a great class. However, this class is not easy.",1
"She often delivers lectures but unfortunately, most of the class isn't listening. She is a decent teacher but I feel like I am back in high school, passed out on a desk, when I am in her class. She is a very nice person and perhaps, if you really care about the course work, she might be very helpful.",1
"Okay teacher, very talkative. Good at teaching the material, although sometimes he talks down to his students.",1
"Was a nice guy, his lectures sucked though. Got sidetracked often. Fit too much material into tests and quizzes. Posted previous exams online and did a lot of copy pasta, so that helped. Went easy on grading of papers. He would assign 100s of questions and would make it all worth 5 points. Gave a lot of EC to those who stayed for the whole class.",1
"Her class is really easy. Her accent is so cool. so passionate about her teaching. She made architecture fun and interesting. The class is really easy. five tests, all are questions given to you in the back of the book, study those and you'll get an A on everyone. lowest test score gets dropped. Most definitely easy class and you actually learn.",1
He is a good storyteller. I learned a lot about indigenous people. We watched a lot of movies in class.,1
The best professor I've ever had!,1
"The class is dumb, in my opinion. Very easy, very commonsense material. Don't usually look forward to it. Hassey is a cool guy though and an easy grader. He doesn't care about deadlines and doesn't like exams. You need an online version of the textboox for mcgraw hill access but you rarely if ever need to read anything.",1
"DON'T TAKE CLASS WITH HIM!  If you want a sense of dignity and want to feel respected as a person, don't take Rogers.",0
"Arie's class was very rewarding. He covered the theory in great detail and really enjoyed his proofs. The tests, except for the final, were pretty long so finishing the test is extremely important. I really liked his teaching style and his curves were generous at the end.",1
He assigns a lot of homework and the 5 tests plus the final are the most important to your grade. He drops the worst test score and doubles the points of the final to help you boost your grade up. He has a different style of grading so be sure to ask questions early on.,1
Don't even bother.,0
"I have nothing but good things to say about professor Jassen. I emailed her probably 100000 times this semester and she always responded right away. She really cares about her students, gives you feedback when you ask, and provided opportunities to boost your grade in an already difficult class. Be prepared to study, don't fall behind/""catch up "" !",1
Great professor with years of experience in law...I have never seen a professor so eager to teach like this one!!!! If you are still deciding on what you are going to be for the rest of your life he is great to talk to...Good luck,1
Professor was a great professor for his first time teaching. Sometimes he would make mistakes giving examples but he's very fair and will go over everything and correct his mistakes. Book is Mandatory and be prepared for a heavy load of work for CIS 495,1
Jeff Rules!,1
"Everything is pretty much automated.  Very little interaction with teacher, but she expects students in her online class to meet up with up to 6 other people to record essays.",0
"I took 27 and 20 from Thana. He picks good texts from top universities. His lectures are detailed. Best CIS lecturer in Peralta. He assigns homework that is too hard and there really aren't resources available to help the students. I teaches at a university level but we skip lab and don't have discussion, GSI's or tutors. He knows the material.",1
boring lecture..! too long ..! attendance is mandatory ...! can't leave class until he says so.! even he has taken your attendance many more things likes this,0
"Rick is a really great teacher, easy marker, but everything is due at the very end of the semester, overall...highly reccomended",1

Tough on APA format. Uses 7th edition but doesn't let you know in advance,1
She is a very informative and wonderful professor. she is very clear and has great lectures and teaching techniques. I learned alot about History in a comfortable environment.She explains everything very well so that when it comes time for the test you are completely ready with no surprises. THe class was very engaging and exciting. Must take!!!,1
I was terrified to take statistics but Dr. Clark had spoke in a previous class that I had taken about how he wants to help everyone learn statistics.  When I signed up for stats I made sure I got him. I was not disappointed at all. He makes sure his students understand the material and is available when they do not. I reccomend this professor to anyone wanting to learn stats!,1
"A huge wieny. She made my life miserable. Her class policies suck and she is not understanding at all. I hated attending class and she barely even taught anything. She was rude, ignorant and did not even offer to help when my grade was failing. Never take her. It will be the worst decision you have ever made",0
"Lectures are dragged-out and could be much shorter if she didn't give multiple 30-minute breaks. Also, Aplia assignments get graded by average instead of your highest score. Let's say I get a 5/5 on the second or third attempt of a problem, the final score would be something like 2.7/5 depending on what you got in previous attempts.",0
"I took Calc 1 and ended with a C-, took Calc 2 with Jennifer and ended with a B+ . She really cares if you are understanding what is going on in class, in fact her whole teaching style is structured around that. She goes over material in the beginning of class, and goes around w TA to each group giving them 1:1 help. Extremely recommend taking her.",1
She is an easy teacher and entertaining. She posts all her power points and gives study guides for tests. If you use those you will do well on tests.  You have to come to class because she does in class assignments that you can't make up if you're not there.   If you're looking for an easy class this is a good one.,1
"It was a hilarious turn-out for my last concert critique, I analyzed every specific component that happened in that hall. It was just not to her liking that specific events that she felt were inappropriate, even though she told me analyze everything going on. I had been doing great all semester so that 40% didn't budge my ride at all,bemorespecific",1
"Dr. Chris is a very hard professor, most of the time unfair and one way, his way. He does not seem to know more than one teaching and testing style. Basically if it's not word perfect, it is wrong. Does not look to see if you have learned anything; he just wants to see if you can memorize things. Tests are horrible. I never want to take him again.",0
"She is the best teacher ever.  She explains everything very well, and make the class so fun.",1
"It's true that she is not that clear with directions for assignments. She can be very vague sometimes. She is NOT a bad prof. though. She is very helpful, you just have to keep at her in order to get the info you need. The research reports aren't super easy but I went to her office hours, got help, and ended up making an A. Textbook needed to study",1
"This professor doesn't really care about this class and is a very easy grader. As long as I submitted something, I received full points which is bad for learning but is good for a class which is just an extended version of CIT 356. I suggest taking this class with him but don't expect to hear back from him when you email him.",1
"Gives detailed answers to questions, very helpful, kind, and easy to follow.",1
Best teacher ever!!!! Prof Ball made math fun and easy to learn. Hilarious man and very very inspiring!,1
"She was really cool, and helped out alot.",1
"Mrs. Jackson's class will change your life. She is easy to talk to and exceptionally willing to help you and will make you feel at home. Some classes were a little like group therapy, and she gives you tools to lead a happier, more mindful life. I was nervous about taking this class, but it has had a huge impact on my life, and I'm glad I took it.",1
nice person. frustrating methods of teaching and returning graded work. one hand in assignment and quiz a week that is all for points. haven't gotten most stuff back. tries to be nice to students when they don't understand but really just embarrasses them. take shaw instead.,0
"He uses a ""flipped classroom,"" so basically, you are paying $4,500 to teach yourself the entire course and then have him grade your tests. He has a thick accent so his lectures are a little difficult to understand, and they're SUPER boring, but he's a nice guy and will provide help if you need it.",0
The Gordon Ramsey of PhotoJournalism. Your video/photo quality will improve when he criticizes you. But it is what it is: People often think others are out there to get him/her so people take his criticism up the anal.,1
I loved Mr. Goodman's class. Although he is quite monotone (and he knows it) he is a great teacher. I would recommend this professor to anyone!,1
"I had her for Microeconomics (ECON 211) and she was great. She was very straightforward with her grading. If you put in the effort with the discussion posts and follow rubrics, you'll be fine.",1
"A very smart professor with lots of intellectual qualities, yes with too much writing in her class also 3 or 4 heavy tests and like 12 lab quizzes but at the end a professor with to much knowledge in biology and zoology",1
Best math professor at elac. She makes all the lectures interesting and fun. Take her if you're not a math person.,1
Not too bad of a class.  He is very good to us students,1
"Dr. Powell is one of the best PSYCH profs I have had to date. He is incredibly knowledgeable and manages to make some pretty dry topics interesting. His course is set up in the optimal way to learn, which involves a quiz a week. Anyone willing to read the textbook and put in a reasonable amount of work should get an excellent mark and learn a lot.",1
"He would rather insult your writing than offer constructive criticism, which takes all the joy right out of creative writing. He forces you to write inside the box unlike better writing classes. His syllabus is hypocritical.",0
He is excellent..He knows his stuff. He is very caring and understanding of his students. He makes the time fly!! If you want a really good teacher for Psychology Please take him..He is really the best.,1
Brent knows his stuff and tells you way more than you need to know. He gets way to in depth which makes it hard to stay engaged. Quizzes are short answer and very hard. He grades very tough. He is a good guy that knows his stuff. He loves the study of seeds for some odd reason.,1
"There was so much work I was dreaming in equations. But, all the work paid off because if you paid attention and did everything, it would eventually click. I thought he did a great job, specially for a summer semester (more like 20 hrs of hw a week!).",1
Very easy teacher. You dont need the book. you sit and do nothing in class but take notes. we took only two tests. gives extra credit work. and thats about it. Loved his class,1
"He's so loud, eugh. He gives you 2 or 3 abstract assignments with no clear directions. If you're a novice Adobe user, good luck, pal! He won't go over the programs much in class, & def. won't teach you. Whenever we had class (he canceled a lot) he would just go on rants. (not useful!) Pro Tip: When he critiques, don't talk back. It can get uglyy.",0
"This class is a lot of work--2 midterms, 1 big paper, 2-3 mini essays, and biweekly discussions--but it's one of the most valuable courses in the Music department. Go to class, work hard and you should get an A.  The challenge of this class comes from the amount of work, not the degree of difficulty. You'll learn a ton about the music industry.",1
While I won''t deny that I think my writing improved from taking this course I would never recommend a Nelson class to anyone.  He''s very pretentious and he addresses his classes with such an air of superiority as if we are simply lucky that he''s letting us in on his insights about literature and the English language.  I would avoid at all costs,0
"Was boring! Taken the fact I work a graveyard shift, Ive taken morning classes after work and I was able to make it through the 3 hours! But his sense of humor was off beat and just made snooze the whole class. Very caring and passionate about his students. Open book test.",1
This guy is great when you get know him.,1
"Lots of folks don't like her, I can't understand why (perhaps they just don't like math or they don't try. I really enjoyed Dr. Menzel's demeanor and she was very willing to help.",1
"Dr Pittman was an incredibly kind and helpful woman. She took great care go get to know all of her students, and although her sense of humor could be a bit awkward, it really showed. Her grading practices were fair and she made sure you understood why you recieved the grade you did. Couldnt recommend enough.",1
"After orientation i felt i would do well. Then i forgot  about the 1st exam which was due 4 days after orientation. She wont reset a test if taken 2 days from due date. Must take exams early to receive help with resetting exams regardless of whether the site crashes or you get locked out.  --stupid rule, she should be available att all times.",0
"Good teacher, knows a lot about music. I learned a lot about music, probably one of the single most interesting classes I ever took. Important to make a friend in the class though, there was a partner project and I got stuck with a difficult partner. Other than that the class should be easy do the papers and make sure you spell cymbols right.",1
"Dr. Falk is the nicest professor that I have dealt with, but I had a hard time learning in this class. Every day I was so confused and did not know what I was writing down. The homework dealt with topics that are not even covered until a few class periods after they are due and the exam grades are always really bad in regards to the class.",0
He is funny and the best professor ever.,1
"Shes the easiest and nicest Professor I have had so far, she is really understanding, easy A attendance is not mandatory, tests are so easy, this is how the KSU 1101 class should be taught.",1
"Ferguson doesn't use lecture slides or courselink. He doesn't engage in any class discussion. He speaks crystal-clear and at a pace that allows you to get all the necessary notes down. Show up to every class, take good notes, and you'll get an A. I never opened the textbooks. ",1
"Paul Young exemplifies the very best this school has to offer. People who complain about his exams and exercises clearly don't understand how college courses work... Paul's Music Media Solutions course was insanely helpful, and valuable. There are few people I've met in my life who balance professional brilliance and academic passion like he does.",1
Gives a decent amount of work but instructions and feedbacks are confusing. Lets you resubmit homework if you did it wrong the first time.,1
"While Sam is a nice guy and pretty funny sometimes, I really didn't like this class/his lecturing style. Don't take this class if you don't like Linguistics, and especially don't take it if you learn better with visual aids because there were no powerpoints at all! Overall, don't take this class if it's just for your distribution",0
Totally taking this instructor again next semester!,1
Impossible,0
"This is by far the best professor I've had in my 3 years of uni. He either likes to teach or he's really good at acting. His lectures are very engaging, he's invested in what you're saying and doesn't belittle you or make you feel bad even if what you say isn't the exact answer he's looking for. An inspiring individual. Take a class with him, trust",1
I recommend you to take this professor. He is really patient and he will explain until you get it. He always does the review before the exams. I'm sure you won't get bored in his class and it's really useful when he gives us the group work to do every day before the class ends. I will take this professor again if he teaches other math classes. :),1
"Math 380 is really hard, so buckle up. However, Tom really cares about his students so if you can make it through the innumerable assignments and difficult exams you'll come out with a newfound respect for mathematics. He also takes the time to try and learn his student's names, which I thought was important at the university level. A great guy!",1
"I wouldnt recommend this teacher even to my worst enemy. She is completely inconsiderate, assigns work late at night that is due the very next morning, and called our class cry babies. Genuinely the most bitter, awful teacher. Do not take her class.",0
Decent lady but she can come off as rude at times. Get ready to sit in the most redundant class. As she drags out discussion and you will listen to people practically say the same thing over and over. I did an assignment early by following the syllabus and she added requirements not specified. Then got an attitude when I brought it up.,0
"He's a great professor and is really clear on what'll be on the test. Has detailed study guides which are EXTREMELY helpful.  Attendance isnt mandatory and he puts slides online, but he goes into detail during lecture which you shouldn't miss. He's really great and does his part to help you pass, it's just on you to work (and you need to work HARD)",1
"I took Africana Studies with Cydya Williams during the Fall 2015 semester. She ended up having to go on maternity leave during the course, so we didn't have much class. Although, while we were in class, she was a fantastic professor. I feel like any student should take Africana Studies because this lady DEFINITELY knows her stuff!",1

"This class is the worst spanish course that I have ever taken. We have so much homework for every class and the quizzes are terrible. She is nice, but this class is not worth it. I have gotten an A in every spanish class up to this point. The quizzes have things we never even talked about and the sakai page is so unorganized.",0
I absolutely LOVE Professor Wheeler. She is very engaging and is an unconventional teacher because she doesn't give us slides of notes to copy down. There are discussion questions that she will have on the board and you will be able to get the answers from the discussions we have in class. The readings are all very interesting and I truly enjoy it.,1
Save yourself time and money. Do not take Gerschick. Hes the worst professor ever. You will not pass this class. He will comment on your papers saying he believes in you then turn around and fail you. Take some advice dont do it. He is the devil. Beware. He loves to fail students.,0

"He assumes you have had experience with coding even though this is an intro class. Tells you to look at Arduino reference pages, which are helpful but you need to learn how to code essentially on your own.",1
"I don't think there is much to add about this professor: he sucks. Look in SH381. See the paint peeling from the walls? That's how boring he is. He wants you to memorize everything. Solving problems, not really. It seems the EE dept does not want engineers that can actually solve problems; only those that can spit out definitions like a robot.",0
"So, he can teach very well. He can explain concepts well and most often you don't leave lecture completely confused. You do have to put the effort in on your own to really understand the material. But his exams don't test your understanding, exactly. His tests are a lot of memorization.",1
"I took Professor Antwine's class online. I wish I would have taken this class in- person. There was a lot of information, the tests were difficult. She teaches you how to case brief and that is a skill that will be used a lot in this class. Professor Antwine is an attorney and I wish I would have had the opportunity to take her class in-person.",1
Dr. Zavarin is unique in the fact that he is somewhat disorganized but always makes things very clear. Very funny guy who simplifies chemistry to common language so that anyone could understand. Easy grader and lots of extra credit on quizzes and tests. Only reason someone would not like him is because of his chillness,1
"She is awesome! Takes her time to explain each problem. Very helpful and makes math interesting! Take her for math and you will not regret it. I am currently in her 1314 8 wk class with an A, so far. I hate math and never thought i would be doing so good and actually learning it. Thanks Professor Gordon!",1
Shelby's lectures are very detailed and go over the main points from the textbook.  There is a group project presentation. Two typed essays. and Two exams. ,1
Wofford is easily my favorite econ professor. He's a great person and his lectures are easily the most fun out of any professor I've ever had. Just beware heavy phone users: he is very strict on phone usage as he has threatened to fail students who use their phone during class.,1
"Easy way to fill quan requirement. He's a CPA, so he knows what he's talking about, but doesn't teach the class very well. Just reads off of powerpoint, shows out of date videos on Fridays. Easy multiple choice midterm and final, minimal online homework, 15 worksheets due at end of semester. EASY!",1
"Professor Wells has easily been one of my favorite teachers I've had here at ECU. Her class is so fun and she always gives really goog feedback on the homework. She supports everyone's creativity and is an excellent teacher. If given the opportunity, I would definitely take her class again!",1
"SHE IS A EXCELLENT TEACHER, AWSOME PERSON SHE CARE ABOUT HER STUDENTS",1
"Explains clearly and is great with answering questions too. Professional. Straightforward assignments. Likes class discussion/shared opinions. One group project for the class (very simple). Online work can be slightly tricky, but slides/notes help. A bit awkward, but pleasant. A great teacher, period.",1
"Overall she a good teacher, but she typical college professor. very boring and dull. she very nice, but the way she teach is confusing.",0
The BEST teaher I have had thus far. He keeps yuou laughing the entire time. You will never become bored in this computer class. Just be sure to do ALL of the homework assignments and the majority of them are easy. Really enjoyed the class! Take him!,1
"She tells u exactly what u need  for ur papers and if u take it into her before it do to ask for help shell tell you how to fix it Its not that she's a tough grader but she gives people grades they deserve. She has workshop very often so you won't have to go to every single session, which is pretty awesome. seriously take her and reach out for help",1
"I think she was a great prof, and if I had the chance I would enroll in one of her classes! I am not sure what everyone dislikes about her. I went to every class, took notes, and received a great mark of 89%. She literally gave us the questions she would ask on the exam and really tried to engage the students in a conversation. Very good prof! :o)",1
She is a great professor and easy to pass her class. Just stay on top of things. She also posts all the weekly assignments at once so you can do all the questions in advance if you would like. Very nice and helpful too,1
"He tells you at the beginning of the semester exactly how to pass his class. His homework is worth 1200 points and you will reach the max amount of points within the first month and a half if you do it correctly. The sample tests and the actual tests are almost exactly the same. Even if math isn't your thing, you will pass.",1
"Wow, I already liked math since I'm a computer science major, but I could see how somebody who doesn't would just absolutely love him. He's great and hilarious, makes math fun for everyone. Just do your homework online and pay attention in class. He doesn't really mind attendance.",1

fantastic lecturer,1
Professor Burman made this class easy. I had previously taken 102 with Brunemmer and failed but took this class again with Burman and got a 3.9 She offers a ton of extra credit so show up to class to know when she announces them. She is always available to help. Lectures aren't mandatory except for the 1st week of classes. I used the book maybe once.,1
Worst professor I've ever had. Had him for Pentateuch and gospels in the same semester. His opinion is always right and if you disagree he will laugh at you. His assignments are ridiculous and he doesn't explain them. I am an A student and I got C's in both classes. He assigns a ridiculous amount of work and acts like his classes are the only ones,0

Dr. Walker is a great instructor and an amazing person. Very accessible and friendly. Would highly recommend taking her class.,1
"This is a class I enjoyed coming to. He's very friendly, and will help you out if you need it. It was a great experience being in his class.",1
Great Teacher!  AAA+++,1
"Mrs. McPherson is a very kind, intelligent, open minded professor. She wants you to participate and add thoughtful ideas to class discussions. Yes you have to write papers and complete group projects, but you learn a lot. I would recommend this professor. Some of these comments are a bit harsh, and do not accurately portray her nor her class.",1
"Prof. Osoba is extremely knowledgeable about the field of Economics, and cares about each of his students. Your grade is the sum of 3 open-ended exams (and 6 optional Problem Sets). If you are not a strong test taker, I would not recommend taking this professor. (NO TEXTBOOK REQUIRED FOR THIS CLASS!)",1
"She is a great teacher but is very set in her ways.  If you do not agree with her, drop the course.  She expects a lot from you so be aware it is not a fluff course.  Jamie is an amazing resource and connection.",1
"Espo is one of my favorite teachers I've ever had, at first he seemed terrifying, but he's truly a funny and nice guy. His class has taught me a lot and we always have meaningful discussions. He's very passionate about what he teaches. Assigns 1 paper a week but they aren't too hard and are usually 1-2 pages. Really improved my writing. ",1
"This woman is MEAN. I worked hard and made an A, so it can be done. Terrible experience though....",0
really helpful and great professor.,1
"Bowles is a really good prof. Chem 115 is a difficult class but he does A LOT of sample questions in class which help a lot. You have to do questions from the text to do well. But, if you keep on top of things, a high mark is easily obtainable. I would recommend him for sure.",1
Brooke makes students who struggle with math feel more confident. She has a lot of office hours and responds to emails almost immediately. My only complaint- she spends too much class time helping with homework problems instead of teaching new material. This makes learning the new material feel rushed when she does have plenty of office hours.,1
Bertram is overall a good professor he talks to you like a person and is usually reasonable with everything he assigns or if you need help with something. There is a lot of studying you have to do but its not the hardest thing. Go to pass right before the test to get the study guides you can even ask him when they will review the study guide.,1
"I think this is the first professor in mercy's history that lost a students mid-term. This class was unbelievable, i wouldn't recommend this professor to my worse enemy. He has too many teaching jobs and gets confused which is why he lost my test",1
"Dr. Sheridan is awesome! I'm not even a history major, but showed up to every class because I liked it that much. He's super knowledgeable. If you are a history major, I'd definitely recommend. If you're just looking for a easy class - Sheridan will definitely make you work, but it's doable. Just show up and do what he asks.",1
"If you have no prior physics background, this class will be impossible. I consider myself to be pretty smart and I was lost from day 1. Doesn't teach just tells you to do the example problems on your own. The tests are easy to fail because the multiple choice are 5 pts each and he barely gives partial credit on the open ended. Very tough class. ",0
"Professor Schlorrt was a great teacher. He is a bit of a tough grader, but it helps you in the long run. His classes are very interesting, don't be afraid to ask questions. He is more than willing to help you before or after class, you just have to put the time and effort in. Keep up with the reading, and take good notes to pass the class!",1
"Very understandable, helpful if you talk to her. Overall great professor !!",1
Dr. Amid is a great professor. He really cares about his students and wants them to do well. He explains high yield concepts clearly and is extremely knowledgable. Loved going to his class!,1
"Traditional style lecture with ppt slides that she skips thru(states wont be tested on but sometimes are), very few examples considering its a science course. No hmwk to better understand material. Xcredit assignment after, 1st exam that helped comprehend material. Make sure you read all chapter & review all ppt slides before class.",0
"Dr. Kennedy is an ok prof.  He is often not clear with expectations on exams and gets angry if you leave class for your next one in ten minutes when he is not finished, even if class has technically ended 4 minutes ago. Sometimes can come off a bit sarcastic as well. Lab is good with him though.",0
"I thought she was an excellent professor and a genuinely nice person. She really cares about the individual students and wants you to improve. The only way you won't learn is if you skip class often. It's a speaking class, so expect to participate and you will learn.",1
Very good lectures. Homework is not that difficult. Exams are based on the homework. Doing all your homework and understanding everything on the lecture notes will guarantee you an A.,1
"One of my favorite professors! She makes the dry materials interesting, very organized and super nice!",1
Very unclear for what she is looking for to study.,1
"Dr. Hale really knows his stuff, and he's kind of funny too. But the class is very hard, especially if you're not naturally a history person. The essay tests were extremely tough. However, I will say that he is big on connecting different parts of history to see the bigger picture, which is cool when you see it all coming together.",1
"One of the best math teachers I've had.  Worked hard, but learned.",1
She's cool but a super hard grader you won't get higher than a B. Don't take her,0
Extremely good teacher for Calculus. Very standard,1
"This class is rather scary at first but she does answer any questions you have quite nicely. If you never wrote a research paper before, she makes it fairly easy to write it. She breaks down each portion of the paper throughout the semester. Just follow the example papers/assignments she has more than the rubric and you should be fine.",1
"She is great for French beginners.  Every assignment was extremely useful and helpful.  It's absolutely necessary to do all homework before class, especially if you want to be successful within the course.  She was very creative with games, such as French Pictionary or fun and engaging board games.  This class was very educational and interesting.",1
Pretty rad dude! Class is powerpoints but he makes them interesting. Homework isn't hard and lab isn't bad. Solid choice!,1
"I could never recommend this professor.  His lectures are uninspired and quite frankly a waste of time, his homework assignments are extremely inflexible (especially to those who have work hours), and he gives quizzes on material irrelevant to anything we've done in class.  He rarely answers class questions and also curves downward.",0
Too many mistakes. Makes circles around himself,1
"Grades a lot of things harshly and some things appear to never have possible improvement, even if you follow advice from previous feedback. Some things are unclear on how they are graded, and our final presentations were unclear and simply given a number. Nice person but hard grader and not too flexible on schedules.",1
She is extremely unclear with what she wants for assignments and papers. She is all over the place! She likes to shut down student's ideas. She is easy but not the type of quality teacher I prefer.,0
"Professor Mehmeti is one of the best teachers I've ever had.  For music 111 through 212 (all ear training), I could not have asked for a better instructor.  He explains quite clearly what is expected, and as long as you practice the material he gives you, you'll do well.  Classes consist of practicing scales vocally as well as songs in the book.",1
He's a real gem. amazing lecture,1
"pat mckee=GREAT TEACHER for class strings. your grade is UP TO YOU. the entire class is practicing for the little tests. he has a list of things you will need to play, and when you do, he marks it off and to get an A, you do all of them. at the end of the term, all checked=A, missing a couple=B, missing a lot=C, missing most=D, didn't try=F easy.",1
I have not taken her class but I am thinking about it. There are no comments so if you have taken her class could you please write one.,1
"I have mixed feelings about Maureen... she was so helpful in pushing me out of my comfort zone with speaking in front of the class. However, shes a tough grader and has issues with time management. She cares about her students and will meet you at anytime of day or night. Get ready to not know your final grade in time for the final though....",1
"I was really disappointed after taking this class. Dr. Misruda makes this class unnecessarily difficult for no reason. There's absolutely no rubric for assignments. He talks the whole lecture time without any participation, so it's really hard to pay attention. He will cover a needed topic one or two days before an assignment is due.",0
"the easiest prof for the easiest class. He does abide the attendance policy so dont skip more than a few times or youll fail. Other than that, his lecture is cool so you do do other hw in the back of the room. He gives all answers to the midterm and final so easy 100s. only 2 concert reports which are easy 100 also",0
"Read previous notes; yeah she gives extra credit if the quizzes are on time but it doesn't really help. Did ALL the Quizzes & Homework w/ a 100% + Extra Crdt, didn't matter! Her test are TRICKY & the Final, TRICKER! 1 post stated she doesn't review test, SHE DOES NOT! Expects U 2 know what she's suppose 2 be teaching! U Will Teach Yourself!",0
"I won't deny his intelligence. But he could care less about teaching. After whole semester he still does not know anyone's name (class of 20). I've been called 4 different names. If you don't agree with his view, he'll grade harsh on you. Professors like him made thinking illegal.",0
"Prof. Humphrey makes learning the concepts easy and entertaining which can be difficult to do in a almost 3 hour night class. Pay attention to lectures and when he says its important TAKE NOTE! He provides study guides for each quiz. Use them, you will do well. Hes very interactive and quite funny.",1
My favorite professor that I've had at App so far. I was eager to come to every one of his classes just because you could tell he was passionate about what he was teaching. Everything we learned was eye-opening and important and useful in order to go out into the world and to be a good person. Definitely take him even if you're not an anthro major.,1
"Kate is ultimately the best teacher that I ever had at OIT. She is a fantastic educator and extremely knowledgeable. Unlike any other educator, Kate is more than willing to help her students in any way even if it means coming in on her own time to tutor students.",1
"The professor is a bit dry in his lecture style, but he is nonetheless a good teacher and provides very interesting material. Show up and put an effort into assignments and you'll be fine.",1
"Dennis....he is the most unique person you'll ever meet and you may be weirded out the first week but after that his classes are laid back and fun but you learn and he helps you with your work. he is also pretty entertaining with his musical talents...(ask him about his hand music/songs...)HI Dennis, i know u read this!!!",1
"She gives you everything you need to be successful, it's up to you to take advantage of it. It's not a hard class at all as long as you put in the work. She posts example videos, has her lectures posted and has the schedule very well laid out. She's very organized which helped me immensely. Jump ahead of the coursework! You'll be glad you did.",1
"Elle est très disponible pour aider ses étudiants et elle publie la matière par Zoom sur moodle , ce qui est très pratique pour les étudiants qui préfère étudier chaque séance en son propre temps. Ses explications sont très claires. très bonne prof!",1
One of the best classes I've ever taken from the best prof I've ever seen.  He's amazing.  Too bad the rest of the course and program can't even come close to him,1
"The class was a little difficult, but Professor Zein is very good at what she teaches. She's usually free for extra help when needed but she's pretty clear in class. Really tough grader, but great class.",1
Iam taking 280right now. Solid reading experience. The book is not horrible to read though. Discussion due Thursday and grades are returned usually the next day. Quizzes on werkends. Fits my schedule. I am not sure about the rrsearch project or long paper assignment mentioned in other reviews. Not in this class. Oh and I like the movie!,1
Steve is really enthusiastic about his subject but doesn't always do a good job of explaining. He will throw problems up on the board and go through them but doesn't really go into detail enough to grasp it. He makes a lot of little mistakes sometimes so you have to watch to catch him or he will stare at the board in confusion for 5+ minutes.,1
"Professor Crittenden is the one of best professors I've ever had. His lectures are very clear and the expectations are reasonable. At times it can be a bit boring, but what do you expect from Newtonian mechanics? He's very happy to talk with you outside of class and will answer any questions you have! Also he sounds a little bit like Carl Sagan.",1
"His lectures can be long and note-taking is a must if you want to pass the tests. He provides all the material you need to get an A in the class. Study guides for every single test with the answers given to you, practically word-for-word. If you do the study guides, you should pass the class no problem. Labs are fun. Lab attendance necessary.",1
"The class is straight-forward and as long as you generally keep up, you'll be okay. There is a one-page essay due every couple of weeks, and depending on your TF, they can be graded kinda tough but still reasonable. The only annoying thing about this class was that attendance is an important part of your grade.",1
"The class can be easy if you are interested and actually want to learn about severe weather, but I just took it for an easy ace class and it was actually difficult. She uses tophat for everything, her lectures are boring and you don't really use the book (unless you do the assigned reading. I just dont take it.",0
"Dr. Xing was helpful and was honestly one of the reasons I succeeded. She seems to appreciate it when students take the time to visit her outside of class. While there was a language barrier, the material is organized if you approach it critically. She's smart but sometimes has difficulty being transparent with her explanations. I'd take again.",1
"Class wasnt too bad, i showed up often and thats where he gives participation points for. Tests I found semi difficult, 5 total including final , drops the lowest  one. Homework isn't hard which is where most points come from. Would take again",1
"STUDY her ppts for exams, ex. done IN-CLASS & understand the material. Did fine w/o the book or practice problems she suggests (frm book). Exam math portion is easy if you know your stuff, but understanding the diff. kinds of tests & under what circumstance are they used is important, esp for multiple choice portion. this is a class you CANNOT BS!",1
Joanie is a nice instructor. She teaches the class well and will answer any questions you might have. She provides great feedback on papers and encourages you to want to do better.,1
If you can avoid him please do. He takes forever to grade work and his feedback is not very meaningful or insightful . He does not respond to emails in a timely fashion and if you are lucky to get a response its a condescending one.,0
"Mr. Alavrez is a very nice and caring professor. He talks a lot to the students as he is very open, and asks for class participation. He is well respected and easy to get along with. He gives out assignments on canvas every other week, but the work is not difficult. You dont even need your textbook for his class, all you need to do is show up.",1
"Her notes didn't make any sense- my study group couldn't even comprehend them when I asked for help. Her tests are ridiculous and she doesn't teach in any logical order, just throws random information in at different times about different things.",0
"She's a very shy but sweet woman. Her lectures are interesting and her passion comes through them. However the material was very easy to learn (repeated in class, the text and discussion!) The tests are mutliple choice and also easy",1
"This is a challenging course because its graduate level Contracts Law and Professor Mahallati uses the Uniform Commercial Code as one of the main sources of reading for the course. However, she does explain the major concepts very clearly and grades fairly. She also assigns research papers. This is a very good course overall however.",1
One of the only profs who treats students with respect and has made COVID adjustments that are helpful. Always accepts late work and will give extension. Lectures were entertaining and relevant to the real world.,1
"Kula is nice, but BORING! I had him for 4 hours a day, twice a week and that was a challenge! GET MY ACCOUNTING LAB! he doesn't use it in class but its all the h/w problems and they tell you answers and it helps on exams. Exams are pretty fair...gotta know what you're doing though! Accounting is hard...you kinda gotta teach urself if u have kula:((",0
Dr. Hunter's class and work was reasonable. You had to read the textbook and some times articles BUT the modules were doable. Group work online was interesting but definitely made us connect as students. Received full credit on many assignments. Big tip: outline the chapters before the semester begins. Really helps!,1
"By far the funniest professor I have ever had. His class is enjoyable, but make sure you pay attention. He will notice, and he will not like you if you don't. The midterm was a little difficult, it's not what you would expect, but if you go in for help, you can do  really well in the class.",1
"Such a nice happy guy, always willing to help out a student and always replies to emails. However, his classes are pretty boring - he reads off powerpoints the entire time and puts on outdated finance tv shows on Fridays. The midterm and final were the easiest tests I've ever taken, he gives you a study guide, and most of the answers.",1
I took his class online. Super easy. Only had to turn in 2 papers for the semester.,1
"Professor Bardo has been my favorite professor at UK! He is very passionate about sociology and wants his students to succeed. All exams and quizzes are online, you have to participate 5 times, and you have 3 writing prompts to choose from (your best paper counts). He really made this class interesting and I enjoyed going to his class.",1
This class is definitely a GPA booster. There are weekly assignments but it is only 1-2 pages doubled spaced. One group poster presentation which is easy. One final philosophy paper that has to be 5-7 pages. This class is not hard. No exams.,1
"This is the hardest English class I have ever had. I had another professor go over a paper with me, critiquing every sentence, and when I turned it in Mrs. Linder gave me a 70. I am normally a straight A student, especially in English. This professor has caused me to change majors.",0
"A tough subject to teach in any case, but he really tried to break the concepts down and explain things thoroughly and concisely. Couldn't think of a better prof for this material!",1
"The papers are graded weeks after they're turned in. This is very bothersome because you don't get feedback on your mistakes until after you've turned in ANOTHER paper. Also, I'm two days away from the classes closing and I'm waiting for 3 papers to be graded AND the final to be graded. Also, no help. Read, quiz, exam, paper, repeat.",0
"I would never want to take this professor again. I took a 100 level class and it required so much work! I wrote at least 12 papers and had to do a 15 minute presentation with a group. Very boring lectures, assigns a lot of homework, tough grader, and assignments weren't explained very well at all. I do NOT recommend this professor at all!!",0
Great teacher. Made class fun and enjoyed it.,1
"PSY 220 IS about the psych of learning. In this class you learn that punishment is ineffective. Ironic. If you do not get every single thing right, youll have to redo the entire assignment. To get beyond a D, yes a D, every assignment expects perfection. A class literally about learning, this was the antithesis. 400 level work for a 200 class.",0
No Comments,0
Very funny and interesting,1
"I loved taking this class, the teacher is extremely organized and lays out the material in a very clear way which makes this class a lot easier. You can tell she really cares about her students and will do anything to make sure they succeed in this class, and she also provides several extra credit opportunities.",1
"Thad is a fantastic person.  Unfortunately he has a very time consuming day job, therefore it takes forever to get your tests/quizzes/labs graded and back to you.   If you don't mind this he is really funny and makes the class fun and labs are really interesting.  He is also lenient on turning in things late and always making up tests late.",1
"He explains how to get a good grade in his class from the first day. Yes you have to work for it, but if you do your homework and study HARD for the quizzes you will be fine. He gives extra credit and curves almost every test and quiz. Lectures are a little boring though it gave plenty of time to work on homework while he was lecturing haha",1
"He is an amazing Prof. Fun, Energetic Helpful, Enthusiastic.. If I find he teaches something else I am definetly going to take it!!! I would recommdend this prof. to anyone. He will help you one on one if you need to. His theme for the class this year was violence! It is my most interesting class!!",1
"Dr Ouyang is very dry. I struggled to pay attention in his class. He knows the material well though, and tries to get us to engage in discussions. The projects were intensive, and time consuming, however I enjoyed it as I learned a lot doing them. He is an easy grader on the projects, however the final was extremely difficult for me",0
"This class was probably one of the easiest classes Ive taken so far. If you arent really good at Calculus, take this professor! He will triple check if everyone understands the material and will always encourage you to reach out to him for any questions. He never collected homework and there was a small quiz each class, nothing too difficult.",1
"This class was honestly the best class I had ever taken at the U. Not only was the material interesting and engaging but Professor Nesvig delivered it in a great manner! So grateful to have taken this course, take him if you have a chance!",1
"I read the book 3 times, yet the test had no questions from the book. The second test was word for word from quizlet, but the 3rd test had none from quizlet. I have no idea where she gets her questions or what exactly she wants us to know. Difficult is not even the word for her confusing expectations.",0
Honestly one of the best professors my first semester in college. Just be ready to read and ask questions if you are curious or dont fully comprehend the text. Do not fall behind on the reading its a huge part of your grade and so is participation.,1
"Worst class I have ever been in, your grade will be determined by three impossible tests and problem sets that are worth about 1% of the final grade. He is is all over the place. Problem sets can only be answered using all of his links, good luck with that. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS/PROFESSOR",0
Shauna is honestly amazing!!!,1
I got an A on the midterm paper and blackboard says that i have more than 100% on every quiz but I was still given a B in the class. I pretty sure she is out to get me. Not to metion she likesto push her politics on the class.,0
He is extremely nice and helpful in regards to such a difficult topic.  Has excellent examples in class. I took the class over the summer so it was extremely fast paced but totally worth it! Highly recommend him for anyone that needs physics! Homework not mandatory but quiz questions came directly from homework so you should do it anyway!,1
"Ostermeyer has the class set up so that you can only fail if you don't read attentively and consistently work. While there are quite a bit of readings, essays, and quizzes, though they are short. Many lectures recap readings, which will be useful. I'd recommend doing the readings first, then watch and note lectures.",1
He doesn't know what he's doing. He have true/false for 25 credits in the tests.,0
"Professor Bronie is an amazing professor! She does give a lot of homework, but its really to prepare you. Before every exam she gives out study guides that are similar to the ones on the exam! She genuinely really cares about each student, and she wants everyone to pass her class. Definitely would recommend if you struggle with math.",1
"She was very easy. Gives great feedback. You don't necessarily have to show up, but it helps if you want to improve your writing. All in all, would take again.",1
"The best professor I have ever had. This professor is super nice and super easy. If you really want to learn I highly recommend you to take this professor, he is very professional and the most important is that he is willing to help you. Everybody will pass his class.",1
"Professor Kuhlman is hands down one of the best professors I've had at HCC. The course itself requires a lot of work, but he's extremely flexible with when you can turn it in. He puts in a lot of effort to get the information across, and he's always available after class for extra help. 100% recommend him for an A.",1
"Very specific grader, very strict about citations and academic integrity. Not lenient with deadlines. Very opinionated and will debate with you until the end of class if he disagrees with your standpoint. If you're up for a challenge, take him. If you're not, I wouldn't.",0
Professor Walker is by far the best professor i have had. There are 2 writing assigments due every week as well as class acitivites that are worth 10 points but she provides a study guide for each exam which consists of 50 multiple choice questions. Final consisted of a group project requiring a 10 slide resentation and 5-7 page research paper.,1
"Read this book, then listen to me re-read everything you just read in the most monotone voice ever. *Snore* Would be a useful class if I were going to teach in a class where I would give tests. Very boring, required class. Few tests. Few quizzes. Just a boring class with no incentive to study til the night before. Sucks the fun out of teaching. ",1
The best english teacher ever. Mrs. Van Horn was always ready to help anyone in any way. Very considerate and thoughtful. Absolutely recommend her class. Great Teacher!!!,1
"Barcley is quite focused on experiential learning methodology. His book choices are from the Lean Start-up gurus with a focus on current epistles from Eric Ries and Steve Blank. Absolute enjoyed trip to Chicago for Hyde Park Angels seminar. However, I do not share his love of Apple technology, Android is fine.",1
"Great classes, great instructor, very knowledgeable and caring...very hot!",1
"She's a good person, but the sound of heels coming down the hallway meant the torture was about to begin. It was unbearable sitting through the class. It seemed like she was assuming that nobody had anything better to do than focus on composition. The first half of the semester is back to back papers that could have been more evenly distributed.",0
Very personable and fun professor,1
"Jeri is amazing! She made me feel at home as a transfer student and helped me find a direction I wanted to take my art! I wish I had more classes with her, because she is one of the only one in the art department who will actually sit down with you and help you through things. Super fun lady as well! She has a sheep farm and a puppy she loves.",1
I loved taking Professor Stevenson. She was always so helpful by sending her students handouts and lists showing everything you need to know for each exam. (Many of the other lab professors only gave their students access to powerpoints). Every lab class has 3 exams and mastering assignments every week. Take Professor Stevenson!!!!,1
He's explains things very clearly and is always willing to answer questions in and after class. I'd definitely recommend a class with him.,1
"I had Dr. Trammell for Liberated Learning and he was easily my favorite professor this past semester. A non-traditional grading style that actually works in favor of the student. Each class provided awesome content with real life value you simply cannot receive from another course. I never once dreaded coming to class, rather enthused and engaged.",1
"I had her a semester ago and loved her so much I took another class with her. However, this time is completely different. I don't feel like she's teaching me anything herself, I'm ""learning"" through the 60+ pages of nightly reading. Very very heavy on reading - a little disappointed",1
"Wonderful professor, kind and fun. Lessons were easy to follow, and he posts videos on YouTube for extra help. Youll get an A if you put in effort. He loves what he does and it shows.",1
"Dr. Hartman has to be my favorite professor so far at Kutztown. She is super understanding of family situations and also spends a great ordeal trying to get to know you, which I appreciate. She gives really helpful feedback. I'd say the easiest way to get an A is to put a lot of personality in the writing assignments and do them on time",1
The workload is rigorous but Dr. Jones keeps you inspired and motivated enough to get it done. It's obvious that she cares about her students and that her number one priority is to prepare you for the remainder of the program and for your career. Great professor.,1
"You must attend class, she doesn't do powerpoints. Everything is written and drawn on the board with different color markers so its very easy to follow. Her quizzes are harder than her tests. Her tests consist of multiple choice, fill in the blanks, drawing pathways, some calculations, and scenario questions. She does curve her tests.",1
Good guy. Very cool and makes sure that you enjoy class time. Class was not all that difficult. I would take TJ again.,1
"Tough love.  Brutally honest and by far the one of the best professors I've had yet.  Inspiring, motivating, and really creates a wonderful evnironment for her students to feel comfortable.  Definitely my most memorable class!",1
"Very nice professor. I am an education major and took this for a LA credit. She understands that not everybody is an artist so she is very lenient when she grades. She does have her obvious favorites, but treats all of her students with respect. I actually learned a lot from this class and she helped me a ton since I am not an artist. Take Her!!!",1
"The most boring class I have ever taken. He lectures every class. You look around and 90% of the people are either asleep or watching Netflix. This class is nothing but abstract, liberal ideology that makes no sense. But its an easy A honestly.",0
This class is a little difficult but I highly recommend it. Mr. Goldiner is a brilliant teacher and he changed the way I looked at life. I can say with confidence that he is one of my favorite teachers and I will never forget what he taught me.,1
Tammi is more than a great teacher. She cares about each and every one of her student and will go beyond to help them succeed. I am a shy person in class but she made it comfortable for every student. Really enjoy having her as a teacher and advisor. Definitely recommended her,1
"Professor Bailey is a great teacher. The course is pretty straight forward. She's a fair and easy grader for the most part. Be prepared to read and write a lot, but as long as you turn your assignments in, you should get a good grade. Class outline: 5-6 essays, peer reviews, journal and discussion boards. Overall, I would highly recommend her.",1
"Dr. Avila was amazing. From day 1 she made it so that everyone became friends before the first class ended. we had 4 chapter exams and 1 final. about 4 or 5 lab reports (2 typed) and my class had 15 quizzes that were either ... group, individual, entire class participation. she drops like 4-5 quizzes, gives tons of extra credit!! love her",1
A genuinely great teacher. Has the best sense of humor any mathematician has ever had. Makes retardedly hard math bearable. I wish I'd taken more classes with him. Nice guy to boot.,1
"My most challenging class so far. Professor Q. does not play.  World Mythology is not an easy class. I always have a workload of homework. However, he prepares for what is to come. Might as well get used to a heavy load of homework. That's what college is about anyway.",1
He is a chill man. Very smart and teaches well. Very clear and super helpful!!,1
"Physics is hard in general. Although it was hard to understand in class, you can't expect to learn everything from him. If you were to take him, be mentally prepared, view his powerpoints. If you really try you can pass with an A",0
Hard tests!!!!! The thing that set her apart was the video tutorials and GREAT survival guide.,1
Took this as an online course. Only thing she ever posts is reminders on days of tests. I had difficulty and bombed the first exam so I reached out for help and she referred me to the book. The computer graded everything so basically she got paid to do nothing. I discovered on my own she uses practice problems on test.,0
She is one of the worst teachers i've ever had in my life. She doesn't know what the hell she is talking about half of the time and repeats herself constantly. Very disorganized and you never get out early!!! She always talks about her family and when she lived in spain. Don't take her class she is HORRIBLE!!!!!,0
"Margo is an horrifying prof. I've never been so incredibly bored in an anthropology class before. Literally reads off the slides, no new information is given, speaks ONLY about Brazil- in fact my class mate and I have taken to rolling our eyes every time she mentions Brazil, which means our eyes are CONSTANTLY ROLLING. AVOID THIS PROF.",0
"Her Japanese class was a breeze. For my final exam, I literally had to act out a skit as a talking dog in Japanese. We sing songs in class and don't do any real work, kind of a joke sometimes. She is an awesome teacher though and an easy A",1
"The course was relatively easy, but confusing at times. He does not post grades in a timely fashion. He changes the projects and due dates during the course. Some assignments do not cohesively link together compared to the goals listed in the syllabus. Be flexible.",1
A lot of people take their dislike of chemistry out on the professor. Bushey's a great guy! His lectures are super clear! He's super receptive of questions and will never make you feel stupid. He's also kind of funny. Don't be afraid to take him.,1
I took her 0314/1314 class this semester. Her teaching methods are hard to understand because she would teach the long way for problems. She teaches you 4-5 chapters every class period and then wed have a test the following week. She provides notes for the lecture and does go over the test review. Shes a nice lady but I would not take her again.,0
"Loved Angie. She made class enjoyable. She is energetic, loves her job, and so much more. Overall amazing prof. This class is great and can be used for everyday life. ",1
"Great professor that offers incredibly interesting reading materials and films relating to what we've learned in class. Lectures are worthwhile if you've done the reading, and his comments on assignments are always helpful and constructive. My favorite class last semester.",1
"Hellmann is amazing. It's her 1st year at AHC, but she should have a higher position! In my ASL 1 class, she signs slow at the start but wants feedback on her pace! She will take her time to go over signs that students ask during lecture. Overall, take her because she represents a true professor. Rn, I'm in her ASL 2 class and I love it.",1
"Extremely rude professor. Not very helpful to student responses, more often to just respond with a snark comment. Poor teaching skills, and course coordination skills. Doesn't listen to student feedback.",0
"I honestly cannot say anything negative about Dr. Ferreira. She is funny, intelligent, and presents you with every opportunity to pass her course. Show up, participate, and turn in your assignments on time, and you will flourish in her class. She gives some of the most interesting lectures I have ever heard. I hope she is around for my children.",1
"Professor Marshall truly is a sweetheart. She cares about her students and is very accommodating to everyone's schedules. She understands that life happens and situations arise, but as long as you complete the assignments, you will be fine. She usually sends emails with 1 page readings and asks for a response that can be discussed in class/written.",1
"She doesn't throughly look at your homework, just do 70% of each assignment and she will give full credit. She does teach new material before a test, which sometimes can distract you. But doing the homework and understanding it does help so much when you take her tests.  Her tests are not that hard if you pay attention.",1
This professor is very hands on and motivated to making sure we are getting the job done and understanding whats been assigned.,1
"You can really tell he cares about his students. I liked the lectures a lot. There are reading quizzes but he sends out the questions on the quiz before the class so they are pretty easy to pass. Emails back quickly and gives good feedback to any questions. There are three papers, but you can have him check it before turning in. Midterm and final.",1
"Very friendly individual and at first the class seems like it will be like any other math class. Slightly challenging but do-able. His exams, however are some of the hardest material I have ever seen. His examples and homework do not help at all. Save yourself the pain and do not take his class.",0
Knows his subject extremely well.,1
Very intelligent Professor who teaches in a style that many do not like.  He lays out what is required to do well in the class and many refuse to listen.,1
"His lectures are confusing. No examples shown. He might ask you to try to carry out a titration or two with specific conditions, but he won't go step by step to show you how it's done. Get ready to teach yourself. Tests are decent but you have no extra time so work efficiently. Students didn't finish the first two tests due to time. ",1
"It took me a little while to get used to Dr. Knox and his grading style. He is very thorough in grading, but it is because he genuinely cares about his students. There is one paper, the family autobiography. It is time-consuming but totally worth the effort. Overall, great professor! Taken online due to COVID",1
"This class had its up and downs. Dr. Curtis was an interesting lecturer; she made an 8am class entertaining. But her lectures were rarely relevant to the topics on the exams. She mentioned broad topics, but for the exams, you're teaching yourself. She tells you what topics will be on the exam but it would help to be lectured on it.",1
"Although i can't stand to listen to him s-l-o-w-l-y p-r-o-n-o-u-n-c-e e-v-e-r-y w-o-r-d, he is very nice, and practically throws the marks at you.  A little dedication is all you need to get an A (Practically no chemistry knowledge required!).",0
"You can really tell how much Dr. Eubanks enjoys World lit, when you participate in class discussions ! The class does require a lot of reading (which he provides online), but he does a pretty great job of going over analysis questions/high points of the readings in class. !!!Take notes--will help for the in-class exams!!!",1
"Nice guy, lousy teacher. Get ready to fly through powerpoints, watch a bunch of JMP tutorials, and do random assignments and busywork.",0
"One of the nicest professors i've had in my college career. Has never tried to trick any one about the content of her quizzes and exams. She's been very clear about what to expect. And honestly even if you zone out a bit in class, the book tells you everything you need. Just read/scan through before taking a test. Amazing.",1
"This was the hardest class I have ever taken, but I have learned so much. Tom is a wonderful teacher and really pushed me to be a great student. You will do well on assignments if you pay attention and follow directions. He is very helpful when you have questions. It is very rewarding when you do well on assignments in his class! Love him!!",1
"Best professor to date. His lectures were easy to follow, the reading was a bit tedious at times but fun to read, and his assignments were easy if you put in work for it. The research paper for the class was easier than it looks and the Professor is always ready to explain anything! Hands down a fantastic teacher!",1
"A lot of work; discussions, quizzes, and assignments every week! She posts a grading scale so that you know how to answer discussions & assignments. 4 test total including 1 final. Not too hard; very long! She posts a lot of material to help you do the work and book is FREE! Responds to email in a fair manner. Not a hard class, just put in effort!",1
"While activities programming itself is a fun idea (I mean really, playing games for an hour and a half? awesome!), Christine somehow found a way to make it feel extremely boring. The class was easy though. Don't waste your $100 on the textbook, I never touched mine. ",1
"you want to learn new skills to increase your speaking skills, this is the place. I am now more comfortable speaking in front of people and I prepare better now than I did before this class.",1
"Dugas is one of the best professors I have taken at Bentley! She is genuine and wants you to learn the material. Though the exams are tough (and common throughout the department, they use CPA exam questions) she prepares you well for them with weekly opportunities (mini quizzes on the material you learned that week). Basically, she is life goals. ",1
Her class was alright until it went online. Gave us repetitive group project worked and graded it harshly. Gave us a lot of busy work for no reason knowing we have other classes to work on. Wouldn't recommend.,1
She talks very slowly which is a bit frustrating. Class activities were also not helpful. She was pretty kind and good with grammar though.,1
one of the worst teachers at cape fear. hard to understand and is basically a self taught class. cannot teach a lick. unclear of assignments and embarrasses you if you ask a question,0
He is a great teacher. He goes over all of the content for the exams with extra review before the exams. He lost past years exams but makes you go to him for the answer keys. He tries really hard to make the class understandable for everyone. He also makes the class fun and as exciting as he can.,1
"Professor Peruyera has been the best professor i have had at MDC. Great attitude, loves what he teaches, he makes his lectures interesting af, and his test were easy as long as you listened to what he would say ... which everyone did because he was that interesting of a person!",1
"Unreasonable amount of work. Don't take online with this professor, the amount of useless work I had to do took up all of my time for studying for other courses. She makes you write, review, take, and grade your own short response tests. The course isn't even about ecology content because she makes you focus so much on test writing skills.",0
Great teacher. She respects and cares about students who show that they respect and care about the class. If you go to class and do the work you will be fine and more importantly- Pass required state tests.,1
"I had him in high school for the same subject. He's funny and a nice guy, but his papers are long and confusing. You also have to do the readings or you won't pass the quizzes. It's a hard class for a 100 level. It's been worse than my 300 levels. Overall, not bad, but you have to work.",1
Professor Prasad is really unorganized. She's really informative but I wouldn't take her for lab. The practical exams are really hard. Seeing the cadaver once won't help you remember the body parts. The open labs are short too. There's so much to remember in so little time. Super hard class & takes forever to grade. I wouldn't recommend taking her,0
way boring class he talks way too much and keeps you in class the whole entire time,1
"One of the hardest classes I've ever taken, by one of the best professors I've ever had. frustrated with the workload for just one credit, but ended up being worth it for the valuable information. Tough grader, not flexible with lateness. But she did care very much about her students success. Don't take if you aren't prepared to work hard.",1
I thought this class was an easy A until her exams. She makes up her own questions so they're impossible to understand. lectures are easy though.,1
"I just took her online Nutrition class this past summer. I liked having everything available and ready from the first day of the course. She has some videos with instructions available to everyone which I thought was very useful. I suppose someone who has not taken an online class ever before can become overwhelmed, the course is meant for all.",1
hard but good,1
I took this class during Winter session. This class is split into a discussion and lecture during the same class period. You discuss the readings that were assigned and she gives a lecture on topics similar to the topics read. Very informative and an easy A if you take good notes. All the exams are based on lecture and the book is extra knowledge.,1
"Worst, stuck up instructor that makes you have to write far too much about her single sided topics.  Don't get stuck in her class!",0
"Course went smoothly. Try to pay attention to participation during the weeks - that will help on exams questions that involve using decryption methods.  Grading based on participation - easy, two short papers (5pg) - easy, PGP project - easy, Midterm & final exams - hard. But I woule take him again. Ask questions - he will help!",1
"You had better read if you want to pass his tests. Or his class in general... But in all, he's a great professor and I do enjoy his class. ",1
Professor Allen knows what he is talking about and is pretty easy. Classes can get boring and it can be hard to pay attention. He is pretty funny and a generous grader.,1
He's an awesome professor. The course isn't a walk in the park and it's pretty term heavy but that's geology and he's always willing to help you with anything. He even emailed me articles to look at for a final paper for my SOC class. He really cares about making the material relevant to our lives. Definitely want him for GEO classes in my future!,1
"I hate her online class, its poorly put ogether. She forces you to post these half-hearted, mindless replies to stories NOBODY reads. Her online tests are set up in a stupid way, where if you accidentally hit the wrong submit button, you CANT go back to fix it. DO NOT TAKE HER FOR ANYTHING. She takes the class WAY too seriously for a lower level li",0
"Subject is easy but his tests and labs are made to make you do poorly.  If you read his notes and know how to deal with multiple choice, you should do well.  Lectures are boring and uses Microsoft Word.  No one sane would use that to show lecture slides.  And his multiple choice test are like -> look below.",0
"This professor has her PH.D; however, you would never know it. Dr. Lindsey has made a positive impact in my life as a student. I recommend her classes to any student who wants a professor WHO CARES. In addition, she wants her students to ask questions, LOTS OF THEM. Be proactive with reaching out to her. She taught us the proper way of citing.",1
"I work FT while going to school FT and I had little to no problem getting good grades in her class. People who say otherwise are just making excuses. You go through the material quickly. It's challenging but not hard, especially if you're into science/bio. Record the lectures if it's too fast for you. She's willing to help you if you help yourself.",1
"Burke is phenomenal.  HIS 385 is intended to be one of the most difficult courses you take, it's centered around writing a 15 page research paper. Burke makes it fun and breaks the work down to make writing the paper easy! I got an A- in this class... take Burke if you have a chance for ANY class.  He's also my advisor and so helpful and positive!!",1
"Professor Zuidervaart is a really great professor. There is mandatory class attendance every week. Her workload is pretty average and she gives you a couple of days to complete it. She has three big papers which includes small assignments to help keep you on track. Overall, if you stay proficient in her class you will get a good grade.",1
This class is extremely boring. The material is so dry and she does not make it interesting at allThe grading criteria is non existent and the midterm was 5 short answer questions worth 30%. The day of the midterm she held a review the first half of class? Wouldn't it be typical to have a review prior to midterm in order to study relevant material?,0
I love Jason he was literally the greatest and I will miss not having him as a professor anymore.,1
"Professor Stevenson is one of the best professors at QU. Anatomy Lab can be tough, but she is very straight forward with what we need to know for exams. It wasn't an easy A, but definitely worth it in the end. I would 100% take her again.",1
Dan is super great. He knows what he is doing and teaches it well. Hes awkward but in a great way. Hell answer all of your questions and is always willing to help. There is homework after every lesson but so worth doing.,1
Dr. Adell es un gran profesora! You should definitely take her class whether you are a beginner or intermediate. She is always extremely helpful and wants her students to learn and succeed. She is very enthusiastic and fun to watch too!,1
Avoid at all cost for Biodiversity unless you absolutely love ecology/geography. Will overwhelm you with information. To summarize this class... ecology trivia and mindless memorization of random facts he decided would make a good excuse for a class. EXTREMELY thick accent and gets mad if you ask about exam content. Rude to students overall. Avoid!,0
"Quite a bit of homework, dense lectures, and lengthy/frequent exams. But he gives a lot of extra credit opportunities so even if you totally bomb the exams (which I did) you can still get a good grade. He just makes it incredibly hard to fail and he's a cool dude. If you're looking for a personable professor he's your guy.",1
I loved her ! She was extremely helpful. I took her for African American literature and she actually found a way to relate each reading to current issues . I would take her class again,1
He's a really nice guy but doesn't always seem to understand questions.  Homework is minimal.,1
"This is the absolute worst prof I have had. I CAN'T stress this enough, do not take his class if you want to pass. I am an amazing student, and I never once missed class, but he still managed to confuse me more and more. I also went to the tutoring for his class and STILL managed to not do well. Also, he only grades based on the THREE tests. BEWARE",0
Most amazing prof I've ever had! Really has a passion for her work!,1
Best prof. i've had here. Credible and passionate about his subject.,1
"Professor Rickerson is very passionate about historical art and architecture. She wrote the class book, making the course  material and tests very clear and straightforward. I recommend taking this class.",1
"Material is so unclear and when you ask for clarity the teacher gives you his opinion. He will ask you your understanding of the material, don't raise your hand... its a trap. Unless its his ideology its wrong.  Extremely repetitive and covers nothing.  Also he has a serious attitude problem.",0
"The best Prof at U of M-Dearborn, hands down. I took just about every class that was offered with him as the prof. Some classes were easy and some required a ton of research and writing, but you picked your own topic to research so it was interesting, not hard. For his enviro anthro class I turned in a roughly 60 page term paper. TAKE HIM!",1
"I don't recommend this teacher to anyone,  and most of the readings and assignments didn't pertain to English.  She grades harshly on essays and doesn't except late work.",0
GREAT PROFESSOR! LECTURES COULD GET A LITTLE BORING BUT I LIKED HOW HE NEVER FAILED TO MENTION THAT THE USA IS GREAT. GRADE DEPENDS ON CHAPTER BOOK QUIZZES (3) AND 3 EXAMS.,1
"This class is extremely easy. All the homework is online and you can do it as many times as you would like. The actual class time is a lot of youtube and reading the vocabulary words in the specific chapter, so not very helpful. You really have to teach yourself. Tests and quizzes are extremely easy.",0
"Took him for the 4 week session. Lectures can be heavy. Their is a practice exam, you must turn it in for points (majority of it is word for word, multiple choice on the actual exam). Labs are easy and somewhat fun. Also, lab exams (easy). Book was not needed. He was pretty chill. I recommend him if you need to take Bio 3.",1
Absolutely stunning and electrifying lectures!,1
"He is very knowledgable about Hawaiian language and wants the students to learn how to speak the way natives speak. You learn a lof of vocab, but each lesson is pretty much the same every day. I personally didn't like that all assignments were turned in online, because there was no follow up on whether it was turned in or not.",1
"Cashin is the best professor I have had so far at UWM. She cares about  her students and acts like a normal human being. She is a big packer fan so she uses a lot of sports examples for problems in class. Overall the class isn't the easiest, but she makes it clear to students. ",1
"The class wasn't organized at all. Discussions were largely unrewarding and boring. Few, if any, students knew when assignments were due because the syllabus had no relevant information. He made us travel to Orem by 8 am for the final, despite some of us working until 730 am and having no means of transportation. Orem's a 1.5 hour walk.",0
Beyond boring! she is so unorganized and that stresses you out so much. Worst class ever !,0
"Not my favourite prof, found him very hard to follow and almost always getting off track. It was almost impossible for me to define or understand the meaning of many of the key terms to the point where i would rather sit at home and read the text book than attend his lectures.",0
Awesome :) so interesting and knocks out so many requirements. i love the class and he's so understand and nice :),1
She is an easy A if you keep up with the homework and it's not over the top. Highly recommended. This course made me want to take other music classes.,1
She's very kind but not the best at teaching. Her lectures areong and tedious. She expects you to be an expert after a long powerpoint lecture and rambles when she lectures.,0
"Not that it matters, because this was her last semester, but I found her to be very friendly. She expects certain things, but lets be honest, we are college students! If you attend her classes and turn work in on time, you will get an A",1
Hes very nice. You will do well on test if you study. 1 reading and assignment with the reading per week but isnt hard to manage,1
He is a great professor he has a great knowledge of biology. He also has a great sense of humor. Sometimes he does have to rush through the materials to meet his deadlines but I would not say he is disorganized. All of his exams are 50 multiple choice and he  drops one of the lowest grade. You do not need the text or lab book. He is the best,1
I have taken this professor twice. Her class is easy. She is very nice and helpful. She explains what she wants to see in your papers/assignments very well and clearly. You can tell she wants her students to succeed and be interested in what she teaches. Don't miss your opportunity to take her class!She is great!,1
She''s rude. You have to beg for assistance which she will cut you off for asking. She is scatterbrained and never organized. I dread this class every day because she is just not a good teacher and she drives me insane. ,0
This class is super straightforward and low maintenance. The tests are hard but if you read the book and/or pay attention in class they are fine. Westover is knowledgeable and respectful to students. Quick feedback on assignments and you can tell he actually reads what you wrote.,1
"Prof Platz is young and she relates to her students in a way where she realizes that you do not want to have a lot of work. She is really understanding and helpful if you talk to her one on one. The course material and homework is easy, just annoying. She also is not the easiest grader in the world but if you put in effort then you will get an A",1
"Mrs. Crowley clearly outlines what you need to do to be successful in the class. Do the homework problems, and make sure that you understand them all and you will do well on the test. Ask for help if you are having problems, she is very approachable.",1
"His exam for Hist 112 is basically summed up with the articles for discussion group, textbook reading and material from lectures. Fairly straightforward and relatively easy to understand.",1
SO AMAZING!! Such a great prof. keeps class fun and interesting while encouraging students to think!! LOVE HIM!!,1
"Attendance is a  must for his classes, since it can drop your grade. His textbooks are easy to find and really cheap. He is very available on blackboard, you can send him a note and he always responds the same day. Very calm professor but with a vast amount of knowledge in the field. Made me more excited into being a SW.",1
"ok, word of advice, study the powerpoint presentation, pretty much all of the exam comes from that.  this guy is awsome and has a lot of passion for jour. plus field trips! who can complain?!?!",1
"Margaret is the sweetest professor. You should at least skim the readings for her class if you want an A at the end, but if you attend all the lectures and do no reading you can score a high B. Discussion is incredibly easy. Always lets class out a little early, and projects are easy A's. Sit in the front row and remember the examples she mentions.",1
"Ms. Magdaleno is a great teacher, she makes the class and the assignments fun and interesting. If you walk in thinking that it's an easy A think again, because you have to put the work in. There's always something due and it's east to get behind if you don't stay on top of everything. She makes class exciting with her nice sweet ass and purple hair",1
"He's so extra. If you can put up with him and his unnecessary attitude, it's pretty much an easy A.",0
"I took his class 4 years ago and this is my hardest class. It's not because the level is so high for me, it was teaching me how much I was recognizing and understanding the world and people around me. The greatest teacher, Mr. Lawson helped to open my mind!!! I am appreciated his smart and stubborn sides! =D",1
This class is not an easy 'A'. The work load is excessive. I believe she is posting her own reviews on this site.,0
Awesome online lectures. Always responds to emails in a timely manner. Fair grader. Before every exam he gives a practice test then holds zoom meeting to go over every problem and answers any thing you are still unsure of. If you put in the time work you will pass this class.,1
"Mr. Trower is the BEST math teacher ever. I had previously taken statistics and failed. Mr. Trower truly cares about his students and wants them to all succeed. He is very lenient on due dates, and is very helpful if you ask him for assistance. I would highly recommend him to anyone! ",1
"Ignores student perspective. It's her way or the wrong way. Quizzes are confusing. The class topic is so easy to understand but somehow this professor mixes in her own ideas and it turns into a completely, hectic and confusing class. Despite receiving an A, I know that this class is a ""GPA Killer"". I wouldn't recommend this class, 3/10",0
"Dr. Hauck is probably the best science professor I have had at Butler. I had him for genetics, which is a difficult class, but Dr. Hauck made the subject manageable and interesting. He asks students a lot of questions in class, which requires some preparation for each class. He is a very fair grader and gives a lot of partial credit. Take Hauck!",1
"Crowley knew her stuff, and gave you all the tools to pass her class. No homework for points, instead she takes attendance. She assigns homework and expects you to do it on your own, her tests are similar to the homework, if you dont do the HW, you dont do well on the tests. Has all the 'distractors' - its tough but she is GREAT!",1
Great professor willing to help all of his students.,1
"She's great! I got an A! Good class to take if you're a film major. I learned alot about how music influences, shapes, enhances a film.  There were 3 quizzes (lowest 1 dropped), 3 papers, a project with a partner, and the final.  A lot of extra credit is offered.  Easy, interesting, fun class!",1
"He is really all over the place in lecture. However, his homework and exams are fair. He often gives extra points on exams because he wants the exam average to be about 80. His exam questions are very similar to the homework questions he assigned.",1
"Awesome prof! Helpful and funny, class was never boring. Actually carried on conversations with students before class instead of ignoring them. Always welcomed class discussions and never completely rejected someones opinion.",1
"Buhler is a good teacher, which can be said for so few CS profs.  He also runs a very organized class.  That's a plus as well, since so few profs know how to do that either.  All around, a very good professor.  Have no fear taking Buhler, his classes are solid.  So what if he's a nerd?",1
"Professor Thomas-Reid is by far one of my favorite professors. He makes sure to make a safe space for everyone. He is one of the most caring and genuine professors I have ever had. He truly cares about his students and is very understanding and approachable. His class is based a lot on lectures, and discussions but you will never get bored. 10/10",1
"I read these reviews prior to taking his class and wasn't too thrilled, but he proved them wrong on the first day. I found his lectures interesting cause he would add his personally experience to help you remember. Unfortunately, the pandemic took that away from us. You have to work for what you want- read, study and be engaged and it's a breeze.",1
VERY GOOD AND IMPRESSIVE,1
Golf is so easy.. nice scenery a good break between stressful classes. i Reccommend taking this class even though you don't want to pay gold its an easy unit and fun and you don't have to show up when it rains so take it for fall lol..,1
He is amazing professor thats all be ready to get aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa,1
This course has a lot of info but he tries to make it as easy as can be. Multiple choice tests from the HW and from the lectures. He has his moods sometimes where he is a bit obnoxious but mostly he is helpful and likes to joke around. EXTREMELY anal in the lab... Stupid questions get attitude. He tries to make it interesting.,1
"You will not find a more dedicated professor at CSCC.  Professor Logue is kind, compassionate, and enthusiastic. Responds to emails quickly and is very active in the course. Gives great feedback and is very fair in grading. Concepts can be difficult at times, but she gives you everything you need to be successful. Highly recommend!",1
Mr. Ball is a former police officer and knows everything you need to know about criminal justice. Take his class and you won't regret it. Not very difficult but you must read the textbook and pay attention to the details. Be sure to be active in your discussion posts; as this is what gives you points!,1
GREAT LADY!!!!! So helpful you won't believe it. More than a teacher she felt like my friend throughout every counseling session. She really has an awesome and helpful personality.,1
I wish I could be Dr. Hoffman. Best ever.,1
Brittney rocks!,1
"Professor Harvey is pretty easy-going, but be prepared to read every day. The classes are not boring since they mostly focus on in depth discussions on the readings. There are two major papers which are basically literary analyses. There are quizzes every class over the assigned readings.",1
Can easily carry a 2-hour lecture. Brings a wealth of experience. My favorite professor by far. ,1
"brilliant man. entertaining..hilarious when angry. i dont think one person this semester has asked a question, we are all terrified of him.",1
"Professor Zein is ridiculously picky about what she looks for when she grades, and it's very difficult to get a feel for what she's really asking.  Her lectures are fairly disorganized and somewhat dull, as are many of the readings.  She expects close reading, deep thinking, and hard work, but that's probably not enough.  Avoid her if possible.",0
"Very laid back professor, I didn't show up to class very often but I went for every test, did every online homework and online quiz and passed the class with an A. Good at explaining math concepts and was helpful to students who didn't understand.",1
Great professor. You write little assignments to get early feedback for papers. This helped me a lot and my grades improved over the semester. Her online stuff is clear and I thought she made the Zoom meetings interesting. Would recommend.,1
"Very intriguing lectures, and always brings in personal stories.  She does not lecture for the exams, but rather broad ideas. You teach yourself from the book. Easy to approach, and seems to care deeply for her students.",1
"INF 100 is an awful class, however, Prof Klatzke attempts to makeup for this, and with it being a 1 credit hour class I cannot fully analyze her as a professor, but I did enjoy talking to her. She is definitely a professor I would take again. She gives really good feedback on assignments and really cares about you.",1
"Had Dr. Nifakis for inquiry, and honestly wasn't the biggest fan. She had good intentions, but occasionally made me feel uncomfortable and/or hesitant to share, through inconsiderate comments, jokes, or actions. Most people really loved her, and she does try to be a good and kind facilitator, but I didn't have the most positive experience.",1
Had Michaels for MCHT 111 ad MCHT 213.  Hands down best professor on campus.  Signed up for his MET210 course and got royally screwed as Evans is teaching it.  WHY ISN'T MICHAELS TEACHING MET210 AND ALL ENGINEERING COURSES FOR THAT MATTER???,1
"He's a nice teacher. Always cancelled class a lot & let us out early. He said we would have quizzes periodically throughout the semester, but we only had 2. Very easygoing/laid back. He loves when you laugh at his jokes. I'd definitely take one of his classes again.",1
"Class honestly feels like arts and crafts. Really easy, focused on abstract art. Can listen to your own music as long as you have only one earbud in. Expect to talk about other people's artwork. Critiques are frequent, but helpful. Make sure you attend class, but the attendance grade is not included in the final grade.",1
"He has a great personality, hes hilarious. But when it comes down to teaching, he just isnt good at it. It felt like I had to teach myself, he goes too fast in lectures and really isnt clear on things. Dont bother emailing him because he takes too long to answer them.",0
If you like being stressed out and failing classes because of a single pass or fail exam then she's the right prof for you.,0
Lots of reading but the book is interesting enough,1
"Brilliant, Inspiring, and not afraid to argue, or listen. Mark's lectures are not for the faint hearted. Great subject which I also have a passion for. More Please.",1
"The material is intense. The class was asynchronous so it made it more difficult. However, the exams are curved along with the final so it's not hard to pass with a good grade. Professor wants you to do well especially cause her grading is not bad. She gives you the highest grade based on three grading methods.",1
"I loved her she was honestly the best lab assistant and really cares for her students. She will help you if you have trouble with the subject and answer questions for you. Just do the work and don't skip class, the pig practical was really the only difficult thing, you have to memorize alot but she helps you prepare. She is really pretty too (:",1
One of the worst classes and professors on campus. His teaching is absolutely pathetic. I recommend noone to take him as a professor.,0
"Took him for ""The Beach"". Very cool and funny professor! He does have a couple of exams and a take home final, but you CAN do VERY well on the exams if you read the books he assigns for the class, which are VERY interesting and easily to read and memorize the main points of! I will warn you, he DOES use a bit of ""language"" in his lectures though!",1
"He's clearly very knowledgeable about the subjects he's teaching and cares about his students. I'm one to skip class, but you really do need to attend to get a good grade. As long as your there and pay attention, the class isn't hard. He also gives plenty of extra credit on the quizzes. I would recommend him to anyone taking intro biology.",1
"I think a lot of people can agree with me when I say that his lecture videos do not make much sense. He's smart, but he does not do a good job explaining content and trails off into irrelevant topics. I understand that he has a lot of students, but he takes long to respond, sometimes he does not even respond at all, and if he does, he's rude.",0
He gave no one in the class an A.,0
"AP is hands down the best professor I've ever had. This was my second time taking one of her classes and though it may have been difficult at times, she truly will help you through anything. She's intelligent beyond belief and she knows how to lead a deep discussion. I would take her class 100 times over if I could. Truly an amazing professor.",1
"His class really prepares you for a career in reporting. The work load can be fairly heavy, since you are assigned stories that you have to collect interviews for and write an article. He is very accessible and helpful. His lectures can be a bit dry, but he can be funny at times. He really makes you a better writer.",1
I took Professor .P this summer and he honestly made the time go by so quick. I am a terrinle math student and he made everything clear & easy to grasp. He is an extremely caring professor. Wish there were more out there like him. He will make sure you understand the material and he actually tries to get to know his students as indivuials.,1
"Sñr. Newall is nice and takes time to go over grammar in class. He's really straightforward about what to expect on exams. His class was my first Spanish class in college- I feel like I got more out of a high school class than I did this past semester, but he's new to USC and he did what he could with the SPAN 210 curriculum. I'd take him again.",1
"She is teaching in Rutgers now and although Logic on its own is quite annoying, I still managed to learn quite well. She is a very easy grader and gives opportunities for retakes. Also available outside of class. Her lectures can be a little boring but her class is an easier one if you pay attention.",1
"Dr. Moore was definitely a helpful professor. She was very kind and gave great feedback. At the time, I did not like her much just because she was sort of strict with how she ran the class but looking back on it now I understand why she did the things she did. I totally see my writing has improved because of her class. Thank you so much Dr. Moore!",1
He is an old man. He makes lectures boring and gives only a limited amount of extra credit to a few students. He gives too much homework problems to do. He makes mistakes that involves math and sitting on his own glasses (Best Moment of his Class). He is disrespectful. He takes points off small details. He makes people feel bad. He shouldn't teach,0
Go to class he gives extra credit if only a small amount of students show up. Tests are so easy he gives study guides WEEKS before with the exact questions that will be on the exam. I absolutely loved this class.,1
"english 2, class wasnt hard.  run of the mill english class, nice guy, tries to work with u if you have delimas, presented material very clearly.  i would take his classes again.",1
He is a great guy. He is class is super easy but this is not enough! If you want to learn something from his class you need to read the book by yourself.,1
No Comments,1
"Nearly absent from course most of semester. Finals week and still no grades/feedback from Oct assignments. Multiple weeks between answered questions by students, some after assignments questions regarded were due. Often unclear expectations of assignments, tough to know what to do. Very little engagement from Kristi this semester. Disappointing...",0
This teach is a NO GO.  If you do not score over 80% on any test he makes you drop the course or does it himself.  Def is not someone to give help.  I can honestly say out of every teacher I have had he is by FAR the worst,0
Great professor with an interesting outlook even if you don't agree with everything he says,1
Dr. Brown is an excellent teacher. I plan to take him for all the math courses I will need! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!,1
"Come to class, do all homework, and ask for help if needed, you will receive a good grade. He is so understanding and caring. His lectures are very useful, and you will get the best grade if you understood lectures and homework.",1
"If I could, I would definitely take Dr. Prasad again! This is my second time taking Human Anatomy at Benedictine and I am understanding it a lot better and have over 100% in the class! She does give extra credit opportunities and the lecture exams are off of her powerpoints and her lectures so pay attention! Put a lot of effort in this class!",1
"Lipson is kind and caring. He is also biased in this class and even though the political party he expresses his loyalty to is shared by myself I got tired of it very quickly, as I wanted to hear unbiased perspective. I would recommend him as a professor, but not for this class. I learned a lot however. Tons of reading & studying without graded HW.",1
She is a really fun teacher. She expects you to be a responsible student and will help you as much as she can. I learned a lot in this class and had a good time doing it!,1
"I was nervous to take FS, especially online. But I'm so glad I did and that I took it with Nico. VERY straight forward assignments, each week watch a movie and answer questions. 1 paper on a film, midterm and final. Show effort and you get full points. Nico is VERY fast at answering emails which is great. He loves what he does. Take his class!!",1
"Glenn is pretty chill, some of the concepts are hard to digest, but if you ask questions you should be fine. Make sure you do the readings, you have a quiz on each one, and he asks petty stuff like ""where was this published."" This class opens your mind to different perspectives. Don't do your speech on zoos for utilitarianism :)",1
No Comments,1
"I took him for ENGL1101 spring semester & 1102 summer semester, hes a great professor. There are 4 papers due, give or take, as long as you follow his essay rubric youll be fine. Usually 700-800 word minimum. Also make sure to login at least 3x a week and respond thoroughly to at least 3 classmates. Youll do great.",1
"Dr A is one of the best lecturers there is in the world. He is as fluid as it gets with his instructions and is more than capable of answering any question. He is available anytime during the week and his workload isn't impossible (I took 4-week summer). He tests very thoroughly, but if you want to learn it he is always available. Work harder!!",1
"i love professor queen! he cares so so much about students succeeding & the course content is super interesting. super easy a if you're willing to put in the work. 40% of grade is based on a journal that's graded on word count, and he gives grade raises if you go significantly above the words. 2 group essays 15% each, 1 individual essay worth 30%.",1
Great Professor! Very unique. Keeps the class interesting. Random number generator to see whether or not you have a quiz...Therefore it was very rare! Very helpful on assignments.,1
I am not one to complain about a professor but this guy is AWFUL. Not only did I teach myself everything he is a nasty disrespectful guy. He would choose certain students and pick on them. During the year all the hours of packets and chapters in Lab Manual don't even count towards your grade. Your end grade it strictly tests. Try to avoid this man.,0
She teaches  like she thinks that history is your only class you are taking.  The readings for each class are at least 30 pages long and you have to know all about it. She gives you what is gonna be on the midterm but there are about 53 terms and 4 essays to define. She narrows it down but it is too difficult. Dont take her or you will regret it.,0
One of my favorite teachers at Southern Miss. He gives great lectures and almost everything you need to know is from the lecture. In order to receive an A in the class he says that you have to read. He is very informative and his tests are not too hard since he puts up every study guide by the first day of class.,1
She is very good at keep the class engaged.,1
"come to participate. come prepared (but then again what class doesnt require you to be prepared). sold guy helped me when I needed help. not all professors will take their time to help you, this guy will if you ask him",1
"Lectures by powerpoint, but breezes through it too quickly to take notes. He posts it online, so print it out before class. Vocab by chapter is required. Quizzes are always tough. Exams are multiple choice and a little easier (tests for comprehension). He curves heavy and will let you know what to study for the exam if prompted.",1
"Best class I think I've ever taken.  Prof. Mehmeti loves what he does and that shows by the way he's able to teach and share his knowledge with his students.  His love of music made the class very interesting and enjoyable.  A lot of work for a summer course, yes, but you're there to learn, right? Great class, great professor!",1
"Professor Tavss made Gen Chem 1 easy. I would have taken him for chem 2 as well, but his sections fill up. He gives a lot of helpful practice problems and doesn't give you extraneous information. Genuinely wants you to do well, and if you pay attention you will.",1
I woud take this prof again in a second.,1
I love Patti - she's brilliant and funny and passionate about things that I didn't think I was interested in but I could see her point. I'd take her again,1
"went on too many tangents on race and diversity and its relevance on culture today.. even though the class was on pre-civil war american literature. he assigned readings but never really went over them in class. he only gave like 4 or 5 actual assignments, two papers, and a midterm/final. i missed two weeks of class and didnt miss anything really",0
I'm taking her this semester and so far she's amazing. She goes a little too fast sometimes. It that's ok because she's more than willing to meet with you anytime if you have any questions. She also tries to give you as much points as she can even if you get a zero you,1
"I made an A+ in this class - all quizzes and exams are online and are T/F, however, Prof. Frazier is very rude and has snarky comments. He is very harsh on attendance and says it counts for a grade yet actually doesnt. If you can manage his weird teaching ways its an easy A class.",0
"Dr. Baddar is fantastic at getting you to think around the literature you'll be reading, she's extremely insightful, and she's definitely someone I look up to, but she's one of the harshest graders I've ever encountered. It wouldn't have been so bad if she gave me feedback, ever. Save yourself, don't take a writing class from her.",0
"Ken is a fair teacher. He is very clear with his expectations. There are quizzes on a chapter reading each class, but it's usually common sense even if you don't read (not that I would recommend that). His lectures are a little basic, especially if you've freelanced before, but he offers good insight and is available for help. Easy A!",1
"Super cool guy! His class is super easy, if he likes you, you hardly need to show for class. As long as you do some effort you will pass with an A. He likes people who take his classes for enjoyment! super chill",1
"I like this professor her class is interesting and she knows whats shes doing, however if you are not fully prepared she will destroy you without mercy. I tried and did not succeed one of the most difficult classes I have taken in college.",1
"I had her for 101 and 102. At first, I thought she just always found something wrong with everything and wasn't helpful. I used her feedback (she always writes feedback on papers to help you), and asked questions about it if it wasn't clear. She was very helpful and informative when you asked. You have to learn her style and work hard to get As.",1
She is a good teacher. I would take her again.,1
"He is super smart and this class is very difficult regardless of the professor, however Dr. Norris might have given the most fair exams I have ever experienced The study guides are KEY fill them out email them to him & you will pass this class with a good grade. Go to class. Go to office hours, ask him what it is he wants! Don't buy the book",1
"Dr. Batman is a lot better than Dr. Back. Unlike Dr. Back, Batman prints out notes for you and goes over example problems upon that particular subject. He's a very lenient grader and he gives out homework once a week or sometimes none at all. Dr. Back gives you hw three times a week.  However, he is an extremely slow grader.",1
"The best professor that I have had at Rutgers. The best. Super friendly, easy to talk to, always open to personal help outside. He's understanding about any individual problem you may have...always takes your opinions seriously. Above all a great person. Take his class.",1
"Good intro to all business topics (mkt, fin, acc etc). Easy class so attendance is huge. 2 exams with questions right out of the book. 1 large group project. Pick your teammates wisely; not only is the PP and report graded, but also the presentation itself. My partners tanked and since the class also grades you, I didn't do as well as I wanted.",1
Dr. Chalk made a difficult class very interesting!,1
"This professor is the sweetest professor! Just dont take advantage of her. This class is an easy A, participate, come into class and you'll be fine. Midterm was to volunteer and final was an oral based on a movie. She comes in with candy almost all the time for us, she is definitely one of a kind. You will learn alot!",1
Superior teacher,1
"Peggy only wishes for her students to succeed and find happiness.  Her classroom format is weekly journals, some classroom presentation, but most importantly, getting to know your classmates. The homework might not be what you get out of her class though.  She has guest speakers, and other projects designed to help you figure out career goals.",1
LOVE LOVE LOVE Dr. Ferriera. I just finished taking her English 101 class and I loved it. She's hilarious and truly cares for her students. She makes it easy for you to succeed. She will drop your lowest grade if you need it. But also make sure you attend her class because she grades your participation in the lectures.,1
le meilleur prof que jai eu dans mes deux années a date. mm si il est un peu demandant,1
"Professor Drake is an incredible lecturer and is an inspiration for students. If you have an interest in acquiring an extensive reading list of material with a focus on fanaticism and terror around the world, you will be rewarded by the course. His required reading for the course is demanding, and you will not succeed in his class if you skip.",1
"Stay FAR away from this teacher/class unless you are 200% dedicated. 40+ pages to read, 3 tests, 3 quizzes, a 30 minute video & discussion board EVERY WEEK. This was the hardest class I have ever taken and ended up having to drop it. May have been easier if this was the ONLY class I was taking that semester.",0
"I totally agree with all the responses...just dont do it. the tests and projects arent hard BUT going to class is a must and that is the HARDEST part, trust me... waste of your time",0
"Great professor; enthusiastic, passionate about what he is teaching. Makes you think outside the box. Just do the work and you'll get an A",1
"Showing up to each & every class is very helpful and he is great at responding to your questions when you are confused whether it is in person or online. ( Especially during quarantine). He is very thorough when it comes to his syllabus, whats going to be expected and what is going to be on the test & exam! So glad I had him as my stats professor!",1
"Had her for New Venture Lab, really horrible class. The whole class is your group project where you're forced to come up with a new product (something that takes people their whole lives) and make it ready to market in time and accordance with syllabus dates... Unrealistic. Professors seems unorganized as well. Regret taking this class.",0
Good professor!,1
"All the class is about the tests, but requires homework and turning in scratch paper from all assignments. No real in class instruction.",0
"Matt Anderson is the sweetest and most caring professor I've ever had. He never fails to try his best in every possible thing, no matter how big or small. He constantly goes out of his way to help others and is one of the most compassionate and appreciative person I've ever met. I wish I could have him for every single class for the rest of college",1
"I had this professor for my calc I and calc II class, I ended up failing both, but not for the lack of trying.  His lecture are very confusing and he spends most of his time moon-walking across the classroom.  I would only recommend him if you are good at teaching yourself and are absent often, he doesn't care about that.",0
This Professor was probably one of the most confusing and hard to read professors I have endured. She teaches a four hour class that can easily be taught in an hour and fifteen minutes. Only use her if there is no other open class.,0
Professor Beato made IDE very interesting and enjoyable. It was my favorite class this semester. His lectures are informative and I feel like I learned a lot. Beato also cares about the success of each student and tries hard to help everyone out. He took a lot of time to help my lab partner and I when we struggled.,1
"He was a substitute for SPAN317. Even though he wasn't teaching his material, Prof. Newall still put in his best effort, was there for questions and concerns and made sure the class understood the materials before the exams. I really respect his dedication to the class.",1
"Lots of work to do for the class, but she's very intelligent and explains the content well.  Go to class, give yourself time to do the work, and it's not too difficult.  She also gives lots of opportunities to revise your work before final submissions.",1
"I took this class as an elective, but it has probably been my favorite class that I have taken at ECU. The things that Dr. Knox teaches are important life lessons so you actually want to pay attention. He gives out study questions before each exam, complete those and you'll ace the exams!",1
"come for a free grade and you will be disappointed. need help, he's your guy, be it for this class or school in general. participate is what I did and complain is what my classmates did, why? because they weren't prepared nor did they participate. I'm tired of complainers when they dont put the effort in.",1
"Mrs. Calkins is the best. She structures her courses in a way that makes writing big papers way easier. She is not ""easy"", but I really feel like I got a lot out of the course and ended with an A both semesters I took her. She is sweet and caring, gives a lot of extra credit, and photocopies the book so you don't have to buy it. Highly recommend!",1
"Professor Wood cares A LOT about her students. When ""life"" happens she will be there for you 100%. If you care she will also. She wants you to understand the meterial, and also pass her class. She is so smart and makes math easy for those who find it hard to understand. She is my absolute favorite professor. Keep up with the work and you will pass",1
"Weekly Quizzes, go to class and pay attention and they are easy, Max can be intimidating at first but cares deeply for his students, if you pay attention and participate in class you will do very well in his class(s). Having good background in chemistry, bio, physics and calculus is an asset in this class.",1
"Erkoc is a very fair teacher. He teaches a very difficult subject and does his best to simplify things. If you pay attention in lecture and have a natural inclination to Programming and Excel and will devote the work to the projects, an A is very attainable. Beware though if you miss class and do not learn the tricks on Excel/Arena",1
Mr.Martin was great. No many quizzes or a lot of homework. Just show up and do the work and you'll do great. He's nice. flexible and patient. Two thumbs up for Mr.Martin,1
"class avg C-, unbelievable. Have no idea what he was teaching in class. Even his TA's teaching skill is better.",0
Great teacher knows her stuff! boring class sometimes felt pointless and unnecessarily long.,1
"Loved this class and love Berkson.  I love taking a class with any professor that is crazy about what they are teaching, and Berkson definitely is. You can tell he's passionate, which makes you excited too.  The class is not a walk in the park, but Berkson is willing to help you and wants you to succeed.  ",1
"Prof Hansen really cares about his students. He is funny and acknowledges the lectures can be dull at times, so he doesn't expect too much. The work load is pretty light, especially for a 3 credit course, and it counts for 2 GE's. I've really enjoyed being in his class and would recommend him to anyone.",1
Dr. Thomas is a great professor.  He can be a bit intimidating but really does have a big heart.  He loves to talk about his experiences and people he knows.  It is all very interesting.  You must read all readings and turn things in on time.  He is a stickler about his student's writing!  Be sure to go to the writing center for help.,1
"Hes a great professor, super funny and flexible if you go and talk to him about your issues. It is very important if your struggling to go see him in his office and hes more than willing to help you out. I think hes an awesome professor and would highly recommend you take him.",1
"Dr. J is quite frankly the best professor I have ever come in to contact with. She guides you, as you are typically a freshman in her class, through your experiences as a freshman english education major. You will be grateful for the high demands she has for you after you complete her class and have a grip on your life as a whole. TAKE HER CLASS! ",1
If you value education do NOT take her. She is awful for an undergrad student who needs this to get into the Ed program. Her grading is horrendous and unnecessarily tough. Please if you listen to anyone just hear me out. Drop her if you get her!,0
"Overall, the class was a bit of a mess.  Although the lectures generally had to do with the readings, they often wandered off to various other topics.  Lots of reading; graded mainly by essays.  Class was interesting, prof. definitely knows about the subject.",1
"not the best teacher in the world. its a good class but the teacher has her own expectations. my previous teachers have made english pretty interesting which motivated me to actually read, she made the class very bland. if you don't like english much, this is not the class for you",0
"Her class is project heavy so be prepared to put in a lot of hours. Her quizzes are what makes her class little challenging but she gives review slides for preparation after each lecture. Quizzes are short answers, not multiple choice. Memorize it. If you need an A, then you would have to work hard. Period. She is brilliant and knows her stuff.",1
"Dr. Fiege is a great choice for BIOL 152. He answers questions and replies to emails in a timely manner. This course requires a lot of work (which is not graded) in order to prepare for the many, many tests. His live lectures are difficult to understand, but you can access recorded lectures on blackboard. He likes to change things as he goes.",1
She is kinda nice but she is the worst teacher on campus. The class is a waste of time and not worth the work. If you have her you might as well just drop the class to avoid the headaches of her insane projects.,0
"Professor Garrisi is by far the best instructor I have had in my two years at OCC. She stands for 4 hours (I had her for a 4 hour block, 4 credit class) and never sits down and teaches. We get to speak all during class in Japanese. If this is a problem, don't take her. You will learn to speak Japanese without realizing it. I love her!",1
I personally enjoyed her teaching. She was very willing to help me out and gives ample opportunity to ask questions. She always lets you know if she won't be available during office hours. Great teacher. Make sure you turn homework in on time and pay attention and you should pass easily.,1
Professor was super understanding about the difficulties of online learning during the pandemic. Was lenient with deadlines and coursework. Would take the class again,1
"One of the best professors I have ever had. Literally such an amazing, caring, and funny person. He seriously cares for each and every one of his students and will do his best so that they understand the material and get good grades.",1
I took her 8 week express course and loved it. She is to the point and the syllabus is clear. You do need to put forth effort but if you keep up with the work and don't miss an assignment you  should get an A. There's an essay due every week and a research paper where you choose the topic. She responds to emails quickly. Overall great prof.,1
"Very intense class. The content is not very easy to understand, and it doesn't help that the lecture examples are way easier than homework questions or midterms/exams. I cannot believe the amount of homework required to be submitted every week, so much paper used in this class. Each question takes up a page. Starts simple, then becomes very hard.",0
1000% recommend this teacher to anybody. I was so nervous to take Bio online but she made it so easy. Yes it takes time to watch her lectures but thats with any bio class. Every week you have a 10 question lab quiz and around every 4 weeks is an exam. Stay on the work and you have no problem passing this class. She is amazing and incredible.,1
"I love this man. Helpful and incredibly sweet. Once you take his intelligence as adorably awkward instead of superficial, you'll appreciate his teaching more. You actually learn how to use the book you spent tons of money on and use those skills for other classes. And his sense of humor is priceless!",1
He's awesome. And really helpful. My only issue was keeping up with all the work. There's a lot of projects. He's a nice teacher though. Fun.,1
Could not even ask questions because she talked the entire class period. If you tried to ask something she would shush you. Infamous for going on tangents that do not even relate to the material. She crammed 6 assignments in the end of the semester because she used up all the time talking about irrelevant topics. I would not recommend taking her. ,0
Exploring Entrepreneurship it was!,1
He is friendly and a good teacher,1
"UH, well Thrasher is a all right teacher.  The problems that she has is she gets to class late and keeps you late.  She also tries to put TO MUCH on tests. For real, there is only so much a human being can retain if they study 2 days ahead of time. ALSO, buying the book is a waist of money. We DON'T USE IT!",1
She really doesn't care about anything or anyone except for her PUENTE program.,0
"Great Professor for Algorithms, in both teaching and research. Received lots of help from Piazza and lectures.",1
Not a bad teacher and was pretty easy. If you show any effort in the class you will at least get a C.,1
"HORRIBLE! His essays are so hard to get a good grade on, he doesn't teach all he does is read from the book and expect us to know how to write A+ essays. I dropped his class it wasn't even worth going to. I would never take him again.",0
He is pretty straight forward professor online. Class was pretty easy but make sure you study for the mid-term and final as they are most of the points for the class. Would recommend him to other classmates.,1
Greatest English teacher. he is patient and cares about his students understanding the material. He works well with all his students,1
Took Dr. Battisti's immigration class in my last year at UNO and wish I had done it sooner! This might have been the most useful class I've taken to understand current events. Dr. Battisti is a really great professor. She doesn't really care about grades just that you do the readings and try hard.,1
"McCullagh grades none of the homework that he assigns. His GA may as well teach the class. He assigns long papers, loses them, then gives you late. He's very forgetful and has to be reminded that papers are due and where we are at in the lecture.",0
"He was an amazing teacher. If you had questions he had a detailed answer and makes sure you understand the topic. If you listen and do your work he respects you. If you slack off and don't do the readings then he will lecture about laziness. Otherwise, he really improved my writing skills!",1
"One of the hardest classes/prof in the EE cirriculum.  You constantly need to study to prepare for a potential pop quiz (he once gave a quiz on the 2nd day of class).  You must have old material in order to stand a chance.  Teaches mainly via powerpoint slides, and therefore goes too fast. HW is worth only 10%, he takes off points based on ""effort""",1
"I loved Dr. Kennedy. For this being is first semester of teaching, he did a prime job. He offered plenty of extra credit. There was no excuse to leave this class with less than a B at worst. The midterm was open note and the exam was a combination of all previous quizzes. Come to class, study, and you'll be golden. If you need help, see him.",1
Take her if you have the opportunity. She is amazing and I would take her again in a heart beat. She understands this is not everyone's favorite topic and gives you examples to involve everyone in the class. Tests are not bad at all and she provides a study guide and extra credit. Show up and pay attention and you will pass with an easy A.,1
Definitely one of the more easier classes I've had. Prof. Reese definitely makes the class fun and the information is much easier to digest this way. Would definitely recommend. Wished I could add more tags to my rating.,1
"Amazing professor. Super easy class only a midterm (gives you the 60 questions and only picks 30 of them for the actual test), one 10 min presentation, and a paper that substitutes for the final. Super understanding and very nice. Truly loves his students and what he does. He really just cares if you go to class, participate, and take notes.",1
Je déteste son cours et le prof est assez spécial merci... Cependant il nous donne beaucoup d'informations utiles.,1
"Not my cup of tea. Assigned a ton of reading, expected really high level in class essays. I say stay away from her.",0
"This guy is great. A funny, caring and real professor who is in this science for the right reasons. Don't be put off by the lack of reviews, he's only started teaching several semesters ago. He makes learning and understanding stats not the most boring thing ever. Easily one of my favorite professors at UT to date. Very personable. 10/10 recommend.",1
"Good guy, sample tests are very similar to real tests, lots of homework but not due until the end of semester.",1
I thought I was not going to pass the class b/c she's a tough grader. But she knows that she is a tough grader so she gives a LOT of extra credit opportunities to make up for it. I had a constant C throughout the quarter until I turned in my portfolio. Passed the class w/4.0. Advice: ask questions when in doubt & buy the textbook & don't be lazy!!!,1
"Easy class and he managed to make something boring, fun. Our class got a ""Christmas Present"" which was not having to do the final exam. As long as you do the listenings and read the textbook (maybe 30 minutes of homework after each class at most) it's an easy A.",1
"Si vous pouvez, CHANGER de PROF, dans le top 3 des pires prof que j'ai eu de ma vie!",0
"Average prof. He explains things well, and his notes are clear. Bad side is, he posts notes and worksheets the night before or morning of the labs. The exams were fair, as long as you study lots and do all the suggested homework from the textbook.",1
"Although there were times that he had some comments that were uncalled for, I think he is a great professor. He was very nice and funny most of the time. Very easy grading and best of all, no midterms, quizzes, nor final!",1
"Horrible, more interested in where you put a comma than if you got anything from the assignment. Question if he reads the papers or just looks for MINOR grammatical errors. Tests so long you can barely finish. He talks to fast to take notes and then reads long quotes that are needless. ""A"" student that may pull a low B. ",0
"Professor Rickerson is an amazing teacher and compassionate humanitarian. I'm so glad I took this class. Her lectures are interesting and I learned so much. Don't wait to register, the class fills up quickly! Even if you don't take her class try and attend one of the many lectures she gives at surrounding universities and museums.",1
"Professor November was amazing. He's extremely helpful and is really nice. There are some weekly worksheets and reading but it's manageable with other responsibilities that you may have. Everything he gives you is important and goes towards big assignments so you should do them. Best professor I've ever had, I'd love to take his class again.",1
"Absolute Savage, knows more about bowling then Earl Anthony, wish he taught stats 300 too.",1
"I absolutely love, love, love Maureen Maicco (DR.M). Best professor and mentor I've ever had the privelege to meet. Dr. M, you are an inspiration and I'll never forget you. (class of 2012)",1
"you will get out what you put in for his class. his exams aren't easy but they are in no way there to trick you! he clearly and thoroughly goes over all the reactions in lecture, and if you need more explanation, he is super accessible and thorough in OH and via email! don't fall behind, study in advance, and attend OH to reinforce tough concepts",1
"A bit eccentric, but patient with students and explains course material clearly. Great Professor! Material is not hard if you go to class.",1
.,0
I took Schnittjer for Pentateuch Freshman year. He gives sooooo much homework (took me up to 4-5 hours for every workbook assignment). His workbooks count for 50% of your grade and he grades each of them on correction. I am a good student and normally receive A's. This class by far was my hardest.,0
Dr. Feige makes the topic very interesting! Approachable and helpful. Make an effort to learn and he will make an effort to help you out.,1
He is not clear the way he teaches and makes you feel very dumb.,0
The class was unnecessarily difficult. She told our class that she was the toughest bio prof. This is an intro level class but the information she taught was advanced. Medical majors--do not choose this prof.,0
The class was a hybrid and anyone who has taken one knows how difficult and stressful they can be. Brooke worked with me to not only understand the work in a way that I can retain it but to keep me engaged and active in the learning process. the work was made easy after her lessons and I probably would've ended up with a 37% if not for her.,1
"He was kind of flaky this semester, but hopefully he will improve. Pretty solid teacher if you put the work in to practice and apply the material he teaches. Zappa is his soft spot",1
"How is a programming teacher going to refuse to look at code!!?? I simply cannot understand. If i got something wrong its obvious I need time to talk about it right? NOOOPE. ""Its wrong go away now"" - not a fan of this teacher AT ALL.",0
Enjoys teaching and will answer any question that you have.,1
"He is a really good and nice guy but his class is pretty difficult. He loves physics and trying to make the class get involved. But a lot of what he says isn't in the textbook. There's a quiz everyday when you walk into class on a half of a chapter that you have to read and teach yourself, which is a bit annoying.",1
"Professor Boyles was one of my favorites from the semester. As an advanced class, he relies heavily on self-paced work; however, he understands when something gets in the way, and does not penalize for late work. His grading is easy and clear, and he provides as much feedback as possible so you know exactly what to work on and how to fix it.",1
She is incredibly understanding and truly wants to help you succeed. I can't thank her enough.,1
Has you submit things throughout the semester that go into your final marketing plan and gives lots of feedback so you can improve. Really cares about her students and is understanding when things come up. I wish I could take more of her classes!,1
"He's great - funny but really informative. You really learn a lot from attending his class.  Plus he's interested in what he teaches and in students.  I could honestly listen to him talk for hours, he's that fascinating.",1
Mrs.Gordon is awesome...she is willing to help in anyway she can...she does give you 15 extra mins..to get to class than she will lock you out..lol..she makes class fun with her jokes..i would Highly recommend taking her class,1
"I took PHI101 & REL100 with him, Both classes were awesome. Philosophy is a very difficult subject to grasp, but he explained everything perfectly. His classes are super interesting, and hilarious. Also, they are easy As. Show up and participate in discussions and you will pass. Hardly gives h.w. & lets you know whats on the test. No regrets.",1
Professor Sankara is a good guy. He's definitely an intellectual and is very invested in your learning the material. He tries very hard and so long as you try hard too you should be fine.,1
"AMAZING PROFESSOR! Ive never had so much fun in class, let alone math class. He's awesome at explaining things in a way that you can actully understand and is alway wanting to help you out! I wish I could have him for more classes",1
"Great teacher. Definitely takes your learning the language seriously, which is a good thing. A bit slow to grade videos sometimes, but other than that she's great. This is the second class I've taken with her.",1
"An efficient lecturer with an almost postmodernist taste of humor. The clearly defined grading scale, the unchanging format of scantron exams and quizzes, paired with a rigorous schedule with everything planed left no surprise. A solid choice of 435 for the studious, as all were too predictable.",1
She has a good way of teaching that makes it easy to understand.,1
BEST SCIENCE PROFESSOR I HAVE EVER HAD IN UOFM! I didn't take physics in high school and this is my first physics class in UOFM(so I was  scared in the beginning). I love going to his class because I know I am going to get out of class knowing everything I need to know. He is very helpful and clear no need to read the book I simply love him :) ,1
"Professor Quinlan is so sweet. He lectures almost every class, but he's understanding of students' needs and isn't a stickler for attendance. There is one take-home test, a written final, and an extra credit assignment. He prints out his conglomeration of a textbook for you and is very knowledgable about! He doesn't want anyone to do poorly at all!",1
"Chem 115 is a pretty dense course, so lectures go very quickly. He speeds through material but gives the best descriptions he can. His accent is awesome and it keeps things interesting. His exams are tough but fair. Overall I loved the class and I'm glad I took it!",1
He has a discord with the professor in it with TA's which makes life a bit easier. His lectures are well organized and always enjoyable. The programming assignments are almost never boring and not labor intensive. A great class with great energy.,1
"I have had Professor Carr for numerous business classes at Long Beach City College. He is amazing and continues to be a resource for me, even though I have completed all of my business classes. He grades fairly and pushes you to do your best. Making sure you do your assignments and tests on time, if you don't do well in groups, not the prof. 4 you",1
He is very funny but his quiz are very hard. You have to read each chapter before class to get good grade. His lectures are not very related to the exam or quiz so you don't have to be stressed out about taking notes.,1
"Kula is the best acct teacher, he is not easy, but he explains things clearly.  He  starts off tough but gets more laid back each week.  Ignore the other ratings, Kula is a good teacher and a very friendly guy who relates real life examples to the material. Wish he taught more sections.",1
"Great Professor. Not an easy A, but there are plenty of opportunities to bring up your grade. She does require you to learn Spanish. Uses many teaching techniques and in class activities. Very fun!",1
okay teacher.,1
"DO NOT TAKE HER FOR HONORS DISCUSSION. As funny and sophisticated and intelligent as she is, I got absolutely nothing out of this class.  She asks too many questions during discussion, and no one knows how to answer them.  When a student tries to ask a question, it never gets answered.  She is a pretty fair paper grader, but this class was awful.",0
Pretty awesome. Like her a lot.,1
"I took her Child Development class over the summer. The 40 question chapter homeworks seemed so easy until you really got into them. There is always more than one right answer (all taken right out of the book) and you just have to guess which one she says is ""most correct"" what a joke! She never replies to emails, tests arent like homework. ugh.",0
Take her class. She's real helpful if you need it.,1
"Dr. Ponce is wonderful! I love her smile. She teaches excellent information and plans your future career education. When I feel like quiting, I go talk to her and she motivates me to continue my career path. I love her, she is my teacher and my friend. I recommend her!",1
Thompson is hands down the best professor I have had at USC. He is extremely articulate and presents the most difficult topics in a clear and concise manner. He takes the time to give thoughtful answers to student questions in class and during office hours. Makes it very clear what material will be and won't be on exams,1
"Professor Huerta was one of the best professors I've had at Mason. The class was relatively rigorous for a 100 level, but I found it very manageable and Dr. Huerta not only made the class very interesting but legitimately cared about your perspective in discussions and assignments. This class was actually worth the 9 am time. Take her if you can!",1
Really funny guy and made sure to make students feel comfortable adjusting to college. Class was a bit disorganized at times but I enjoyed it.,1
This class is so confusing had extremely hard!!! I'll probably have to retake it this course but not with her!!!!!!!!!,0
"haha, I completely disagree! Prof. Layoun is the best professor I've met at this university!  Yes, her anti-racism lessons may make you think in ways that make some uncomfortable, but God knows Madison could use it! She's shockingly brilliant and the texts she selects are excellent.  Workload is light. Just read & listen well, no need to take notes",1
"Professor Fox is great. She expects a lot, and she definitely won't just hand over a passing grade. She makes you work for it, which is so important. She genuinely cares about her students. I definitely plan on taking her for ENG 102 as well, because she has been one of the most helpful teachers I have ever had. (high school included) ",1
"Pretty great professor. Likes his subject and gets excited about different aspects of it. Some of the things he get excited about are pretty nerdy, but that just makes him funnier. He tries to push you to understand certain subject matter that he knows you will need in future classes. Always available in person or via E-mail if you need help.",1
"the 2 main projects are inventing a game and playing it, and writing a book as a class... both projects were awesome, even though the book was really stressful at times, but it came out really good... theres no hw and no tests, just a final, and he wants the class to think for themselves and not rely on him which was interesting.. TAKE HIM!!!!",1
"I took class with him .... the you really need to be regular in math classes especially with Martin.. His quizes and exams are really easy but his teaching method is terrible cus he only understands for himself.. pay more attention when he teaches row reduction, span,bases, eigen value etc...",0
"If you have any prior background in physics, this class is not hard. He tells you straight up how to do well in the class and if you work hard, you'll get the grade you deserve. He isn't always clear but he does do examples and takes questions. The tests were not anything terrible if you knew your stuff. I would recommend.",1
"As a graduate student, I've had a lot of teachers/professors in my life and I can without a doubt say this is in my bottom 2. He expects you to teach yourself EVERYTHING and then gives 6+ hour homework assignments that he takes 4 weeks to grade. It's all so selfish and disrespectful and a waste of my money.",0
"Val is a real person with a big heart. She loves the craft and her passion is contagious. She will pull the best out of you if you open yourself up to her. Not only a great teacher, but a wonderful person. Also, a mentor to me. Take her classes seriously and she will take you seriously. You'll come out better than you went in.",1
Very easy if you attend class. Attendance is optional but you want to go to class. He virtually tells you what is on the test. Tests will be difficult if you don't attend. Very clear on what he wants from you on the exams. Nice guy. I recommend him for MKT 300.,1
"He's really nice and takes 5 random attendances for 5 points each, which is the only thing that is annoying. Take his class.",1
"This professor is amazing, you will need a textbook for the worksheets she assigns as homework. Her lectures are really interesting, and she makes it easy to get a good grade. She only gives two essays the entire essay, this class is really easy and entertaining. I highly recommend this class.",1
"I do not recommend anyone to take him. It is so incredibly difficult to understand him. I have to rewatch the lectures multiple times, and sometimes I still don't understand what he is talking about. If you actually want to learn something, stay away from this prof. I dread attending the lectures, it irritates me that I am unable to learn anything.",0
"I took plane trig and algebra with Rosin online. If you aren't very good at math I wouldn't recommend taking the classes online. I'm decent at math and was scrambling on some of the quiz reviews. That being said, he gives out reviews that are pretty similar to the actual quizzes. One or two were nowhere near the same for some reason. Decent choice.",1
"Chief Warn is one of the best Professors I've had at Plymouth so far. Do the readings and you'll be just fine. As a Police Chief for many years, he gives real life examples and has very funny stories. Sat down with me one day for 30 minutes to talk about possible careers and gave me great advice. I would definitely take his class again.",1
"Outstanding professor, especially for organic chemistry. I recommend that everyone that can take ochem b off track so you can take Thompson. Slides aren't helpful, you must go to class to get the mechanisms and exact information you will be tested over. Material is hard and intricate but Dr. Thomspon explains it extremely well.",1
"He's interesting to listen to, but gives uber-hard tests.",0
"He absolutely cares about your long-term learning, not just a grade in one class. He takes time to work with you in your real circumstances. When he can see you're putting in real effort, he'll give you a good grade. And he's really good at structuring assignments to actually assess whether you're learning, not just whether you can cram.",1
"This professor used class time for unneeded things. She was not helpful at all when students asked questions and graded unfairly. I would not recommend taking her, at all.",0
"While Al is not the most interesting to listen to and every class is a lecture, its still a good class & hes a good prof. Hell respond to emails quickly and always explains his expectations very well. Take his classes. Study your notes for the tests/quizzes. Al is funny guy.",1
Lectures very clear and helpful. Exams challenging but interesting.,1
"He sometimes responds to emails, I have one that's sitting 6 days not responded to at the moment. He missed two of our classes in a row with no forewarning. His lectures were very awkward, and not useful to the class. There was a required text book but it was online and free; Reading it is necessary for the Midterm and Final, but not the lectures.",0
"He is an amazing teacher and knows his stuff. If you don't work hard don't take his class. He is one of the people that pioneered touch screens and the beginning  of  ATM machines. He also developed for IBM, Apple and Adobe. His work with photoshop and Illustrator for Adobe set the groundwork how to use the program.  Great Professor!",1
He is a very nice teacher. Very energetic and loves what he does. His classes are fun adn easy.,1
I had him for the 260 classes and there were no reason why you shouldn't pass his classes. he goes over the examples in the book and I'm hoping to be able to get him for the 201 class he is that good of a teacher to me. He's understanding when it comes to the class and he always ready answer any questions you may have and hes funny as heck too!,1
She is the best professor I've ever had. She stays on topic and always keeps the lecture super interesting. Very understanding with household problems and will flex to help your succeed.,1
"I picked her due to great reviews, BUT that may only be in class. DO NOT take her online! Had her for Summer 2. Only 4 assignments w/ a low grading scale (15,20,20,20)- No room for human error. Doesn't care to give a good feedback even when asked. Non-existent. Not her problem. I'd never take her again! I've had way better online class experience",0
"He is the best photography teacher at AVC! He's not there to babysit you, he really wants his students to be great and produce professional work and he gives you the feedback you need to make that happen. He gives specific instructions but at the same time allows you so much creative freedom. My photography has improved tremendously thanks to him.",1
"I chose this class as an elective to finish my Masters Degree and just dropped it because the required reading was insane. I was sick the first two weeks of the class and got behind in reading and was never able to catch up. I took notes and highlighted and when it came time to take the test,nothing I had read was on there! I do not recommend.",0
Michelle is an awesome lady. She talks to you like you are an adult and doesn't lecture you.  She is an easy grader and if you study her power points just a little you will get an A.,1
Dr. Trent was helpful. She provided study guides for exams. She also was good with sending email reminders about important due dates.,1
"Enjoyed the class a lot more than I thought I would. Tends to be lecture heavy but gives students a chance to speak up. A lot of reading though, with homework due nearly every class. Pretty approachable and helpful outside of class.",1
"She is kind hearted and helpful. Under stress and often poorly organized, she can be frustrating, esp. when she assigns things and then forgets about them. But overall she is easy to deal with and not a harsh grader. She makes herself available so you can ask questions outside of class. Pay attention and do the reading.",1
I had her my first year of college and she was great! You are required to buy books. I normally dont like reading but u enjoyed what she assigned and she makes it easy to understand. Great professor!,1
"He is a very nice guy, and as long as you make an effort to participate in class and try on the tests, he is a pretty liberal grader. However, he is not necessarily the best teacher. Honestly, the only reason I have an A is because of the SI sessions. So if you take him, I highly recommend making time for the SI. Also, he does have a heavy accent.",1
Dr. Wisner was the the best professor I've had thus far during my college education. I am definitely going to take  English 1102 with him,1
The class provided little in the theory/perspective which made me love anthropology. I learned a lot about South America but too much was vague.  I think doing a short historical overview country by country would've imparted a lot more than going by area topic.  A few test questions could be tricky or focus on tiny details that were not of focus.,1
Take her!!! She is amazing! I am so glad I took her for Sociology! Would take her again! She has discussion and quiz every week. She grades them soon after you complete and she is not a hard grader at all as long as you complete correctly. You get three attempts on the quiz for best grade. It just generates different questions each time.,1
"ASU101 is so heavily structured by ASU that the professors don't really matter. Selgrad is really laid back, but a bit late on grading stuff.",1
"I loved Mr. Pearson. He was blunt and to the point, and his comments, though often not flattering, were never a personal attack. He remains one of my favorite teachers from AMDA, and the benchmark for what i look for when i need someone to teach me something difficult. I think it was because he made his expectations very clear.",1
"Trombley is the worst teacher I have experienced. I was having a major surgery on the day a test was given. I asked if I could redo the test, but she informed me that he doesn't give redo's. I told her my situation, and all she said was you should have scheduled it another day. I scheduled this months before signing up for this class. Unforgiving.",0
"I took English 101, 102, and British Lit with Tucker. She is really sweet and is extremely clear on what she wants. She will get angry if no one shows up though, ALWAYS go to class. I went one day when no one showed up and she gave a pop quiz for bonus points and it was comprised of opinion questions so everyone made a 100. Great teacher.",1
"Dr. Clark was wonderful, even considering having class fully online because of COVID. I still feel like Ive learned the content. He is a nice guy and he likes to utilize group work during class. I would definitely recommend!",1
I love Professor Tompson! She was really funny which helped me stay awake at 8 am. Read the chapters in the book and study her lecture slides and you're set. Discussion was pointless unless you have questions about the information....,1
I loved Heather sooooo much. She is probably the greatest professor I have ever had. That doesn't mean you won't have to study for her class. Her exams were tough for most people but I had a relatively easy time with them because I took in every single word she said in class. Her lectures are really good and she really gets material to stick.,1
She does not stop lecturing the entire class. It's impossible to take notes because she goes way too fast. I had her for an hour and 15 minutes and it felt like she didn't even take a second to breathe. LECTURE ONLY. No type of interactive learning at all.,0
"This was a really easy class. Maybe an hour a week of work. The textbook was actually pretty good. Lectures moved pretty slow so it was really hard to stay focused, and I didnt feel like I would be missing much if I didnt go. But no complaints really.",1
"Thad is probably the best teacher ive ever had. He makes hard concepts relatable to things in your own life which made bio 21 an extremely beneficial and pleasant experience. Nicest teacher ive ever had, all around just a genuine guy. would definitely recommend this professor!",1
Schmurr is the nicest math professor. He is very accessible. I did my work in his office most of the time. He gives clear feedback on our exams. He offers test corrections and allows us to have a notecard on the exam. He makes math fun and is willing to break it down until you understand it. There is a pretty big group project at the end.,1
