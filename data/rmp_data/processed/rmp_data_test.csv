"I am only a few weeks into this class, but I have never had a class that has wasted my time and money as this one taught by Al. He is extremely disorganized, uninteresting, and rude, as he throws all attempts of being politically correct out the window. His text analysis is useless and straighforward. If you do the homework then you will be fine.",0
She is an amazing Marching Band director. She treats her students with respect at all times and will meet you outside class if you ask. You must have music and drill at all times.,1
Grading on exams are very inconsistent. Worst physics teacher I have ever had.,0
Professor Ross isn't great. When I ask more than one question he tells me to stop talking to let others talk which leads to awkward silence since nobody else wants to speak up in Zoom classes. He doesn't assign much HW but instead wastes class time by doing HW in class. We spent the entirety of week 3 watching a youtube. WASTE OF TIME. Don't enroll,0
"I took Dr. B for a 1/2 semester calc class and it was very intense and hard. Spent about 10 hours a week on homework and there was an exam every other week. She is very passionate about calculus so you if hate math, you probably won't like her. I thought she had a nice and caring demeanor Free textbook and lots of online resources to help.",1
"I would not recommend Prof. Ehring to anyone. The material he uses in class is not his own - you can find the PPTs on Google. He reads directly off the slide and gets bored teaching (he announces it in class). Syllabus is not downloadable, was not helpful when I asked for it, grades are not clearly communicated with you. Stay away!",0
"William Coplin is everything someone with low self esteem during their college career hopes to become, a sad egotistical elderly man who has an army of brown-nosing TA's to boost his ego. His entire course was built around having his ego massaged by teenagers. Willing to bet this creep enjoys that more than he should. Terrible professor.",0
"absolutely hated this class. tests were nothing like textbook, old tests didnt do much as hes new so no base to follow. save yourself the trouble. take it at utm and get a 95",0
nicely organized lectures,1
She is easily the best math teacher I've had. She keeps her class fun and interesting.,1
"He's really a great professor. I don't understand why there are so many bad reviews for him as he really tries his best to make sure you pass the class. Lectures are easy to understanding and he drops your lowest quiz grades as there will be many, but if you pay attention to his lectures and show up you should be fine as he is very fair.",1
He is a really awful prof. He only run his own schedule.,0
"Nutrition being a nursing class is tough as it is, but this professor turns it into rocket science. Don't expect any lectures, powerpoints, and or anything other than your textbook to get through this class. She is quick to respond and quick to grade but the tests are impossible, and you're 100% on your own. Would never take her again.",0
"Attendence required to achieve optimal grades.  The psychological studies are always on tests, nonexistent quizzes, and a total of two papers.  F'in easy.",1
Terrible Teacher,0
Had Rose for KAAP309 & 310. They're difficult courses with exams every week but honestly thats the best way to do it because each exam focuses on one section so they're not cumulative + gives study guides. Lectures are def boring and you need 75% on clickers to get full credit but if you pay attention he explains things really well.,1
"Dr. Meade is a good professor in my opinion. He cares about what he teaches. Pay attention to his lectures. Honestly, I didn't do most of the readings because of my heavy schedule but I still managed to pull off an A-. His midterm, final, and papers are not bad at all. His pop quizzes are mainly straight forward and sparknotes will be your bestie.",1
"Exam review is a joke. The exam was the hardest thing i've ever done, even though it's online and you have your notes with you, they will not save you! There were three components she graded us on, midterm, essay and final all heavily weighted. Discussion board is mandatory but there is no participation marks for it.....",0
"Overly enthusiastic, generally clear. Will often get over-excited when conducting and lose the singers/pianist. Not a big fan of sopranos. Well-informed, some trouble communicating, and harsh, but certainly knows her stuff.",1
"Prof Zelikow is one of the most respected authors about history and American politics. HeÂ´s class is a must, even if you are online or only in internship",1
Professor Johnson is one of the most inspiring professors I've ever had. You'll regret not having him for Calculus based Physics.,1
Dr. John Hays Is one of the best professor i have ever had.Having extensive knowledge of the theory of Sociology as well as incredible amounts of exprerience and real life stories make his class an exciting place to go to. He teaches in a very practical way. Most importantly he  was alway ready to help Thank you all the effort and inspiration.,1
"Hated this class with a passion. I got stuck with him both semesters. I rarely got even a B on any of his quizzes and I studied for them for at least 30 minutes most days (a 5 question quiz). The girl who sat next to me skipped lunch to study usually. Notes had almost no organization, and he thinks he's funny but he's not. Love for the Lord evident",0
"Great prof Extra credit on most exams, homework is graded very leniently, gives plenty of partial credit if you show work.",1
"Dr. Shin happens to be one of my favorite instructors. Yes, he is a bit hard to understand at times. If you actually go to class, and let him know who you are, you can do very well in his classes. He actually knows what he is talking about. I will miss him when I graduate!!",1
"Truly the worst professor I have ever had, and the best part? good luck complaining as she is the department chair. Awful at teaching, horribly disrespectful to her students, and grades like her salary is determined by how many students she can crush. DO NOT TAKE HER CLASSES",0
"The best teacher in the department.  Good examples in class, and advising for other CS classes is excellent.",1
"Such a terrible class. Never learned a thing. Memorized his study guides and did OK on his tests. He will not help you and will tell you to ask other studnets in the class. The only time you receive 100 on the ""drawings"" is when he is super busy. Other than that enjoy getting a 9.0 or and 8.5 on lab drawings.",0
"The only way to learn is through the lectures, which is hard to understand sometimes because of her thick accent. She gives examples that make no sense and are not relate able, and just complains about how most of the class sucks at the material and she cant wait to get rid of us. The material is not overly difficult but she is not good at it.",0
Professor Boyles is the best professor you can take for ENG105 or ENG101! He has a grading contract that states that as long as you do all the work (effort shown) you get an A. You can get an A+ by going to three ASU events that he puts on a calendar. This was the least stressful english class I have ever taken and everything was super interesting!,1
her office hours consist of of her telling you that you need to practice the material fro the lecture by actually writing things out without notes like you were taking the test that day. Doesn't really explain topics or answer questions. She would rather give you the same advice over and over again,0
"I took CDES 102 with Terry Curtis in Fall of 2009.  The text was only about $12.  (Design, a very short intro.  John Heskett)  Terry taught the class well, was informative, and presented interesting movies.  However, I did not like having most of my grade come from weekly quizzes.  Though the study guides were thorough, the quizzes were difficult.",1
Not a very good instructor. He makes things more difficult than they have to be.His tests include material not covered in class and he hardly ever shows up for class to begin with. WHen he does show up he is always at least 15 minutes late. Might as well be self study for all he cares.,0
I really liked Dr. Childers. She does talk to you like you are a child but what can you expect from someone who works with children a lot of the time? Her tests are essay tests that come mostly from information you learn in articles. It was sometimes intimidating to have discussions but I liked the class.,1
"Attendance is mandatory, don't skip, they'll take off grade points.  The projects are really time consuming, make sure you get them done on time. Otherwise the class was really helpful, if you like filmmaking, you'll learn a lot.",1
Unprofessional. Do one thing he doesn't like and he will hold a grudge.,0
"You are better off picking a different history class (Like European History). He is knowledgeable about Latin American history, but the way he presents it is not that great. A challenge is awaiting you if you're really want this class, so you need to think carefully before taking this course.",0
He's a great professor. One of the better CS professors I've had,1
"Worst professor I have ever encountered. Told our class several times that dinosaurs lived at the same time as Native Americans. Uses the class as an audience to vent his anger. When asked questions, he will respond with something vague and go off on random tangents. Final paper is 60% of mark, due on last day. Attendance is 10% so can't even skip.",0
Kelsey is a great professor. She went to ecu and graduated from the comm masters program recently. There is 2 group assignments and they're both fun and easy. All the papers are easy and she gives clear feedback so you can do even better on the next paper. Definitely recommend.,1
"Hellmann is a wonderful and caring teacher. She is also Deaf! You may think it would be challenging, but working with someone who is patient like her, there is no language barrier between her and students. Her patience is greatly appreciated. Make sure you also practice signing out of class. If you show the effort it will be noticed!",1
Best Professor ever at GMU. She is the most sweetest lady in the world. She will help you at any cost. If you go to her for feedback she answers all question. A professor that wants to see their students pass and teaches them stuff that you will use your whole life. Zotero was a blessing that we learned in her class. Easy class show up!,1
"Do NOT take this class if you have never taken Calc in high school prior! You will have no idea what is going on and his lectures will not explain anything. However, I strongly recommend  taking this if you've already taken calc. There are only 2 exams plus the final, all of which are heavily curved, plus a super easy extra credit assignment.",0
"Can explain things clearly enough, but don't expect much help if you have a question. Refuses to make eye contact with anyone & is really moody. You basically need to set of fireworks to get his attention.",0
"I have never taken a class with a professor who is so inconsiderate to his students. Grades essays harder than AP Essays (trust me, I took AP Literature in high school, this guy is worse!). For a 102 level class, the work load is ridiculous and he worries about citing sources correctly more than the content of the paper. Never take this clown.",0
"Expects you to understand what he speaks about in class due to the book he has written.   The book isn't well written. Very passionate about his work, but can't teach.  Don't take him if you don't need to.",0
"Interesting SW perspectives, likes to lecture and hold center stage. Ignored some students. Neutral about ideas presented, which makes people feel safe about their ideas. Likes feedback re course and puts it into practise. Very enthusiastic about SW.",1
Teaches nothing but theory. Does not show you how to work any problems and then that's all that's on your test!,0
"good guy, expects a person to not be stupid and to do what little work he requiers.  realy loves what he teaches and has the expirience too.  he can't see things that arn't close to his face.",1
He is awful,0
"She was pompous, pretentious, and arrogant.  She cared more about boasting her knowledge than teaching her students.",0
"This class was very poorly organized by Dr. King. He was very confusing to understand in lectures and tests were pretty difficult. Good guy, but made this class boring and confusing.",0
Awful professor.  Accent is very hard to understand and he has no interested in helping students succeed.  Content is easy but exams don't reflect material taught.,0
the key to passing this class is to study. you get more of an overview in lecture and lab is where you go into a lot of detail. both stuff from lecture and lab show up on the exams. miss an exam and your taking a cumulative final exam,1
He's hilarious! He has review sessions for the test which highly recommend cause some things reviewed end up on the test. You have to do the readings to understand the material plus the test do cover them. You do need to show up to class cause he will offer up examples he's covered only in class. It's an easy A if you read and attend lecture.,1
"I wouldn't recommend anyone take this online class with her. There's quizzes every week, a ton of labs due on the day of tests, and don't even think about cheating on her tests because she makes everyone use a lockdown browser. I didn't enjoy this class or the teacher at all.",0
Do not take this Class............,0
"I am a good student and always do my work but that seems to be useless with this professor. This is the hardest course I have taken and he is the worst professor I've ever had. Very mean, disrespectful, and unfair in his testing. When I ask for help, he laughs and makes me feel stupid. I hope I never have him again. ",0
"Boring. Easy. But if you dont go to class, you can still get an A but hell make you withdraw. Waste of time.",0
"Very disorganized, wastes class time on pointless things that won't be worth marks. Very non-specific about what he looks for. Goes into detail about one essay then tests you on one you have not gone over. Pointless class, taught myself more than he taught me. I always did very well in my other classes and English, I feel dumb in his class.",0
"WORST PROFESSOR OF MY LIFE!! AVOID HIM!!! He's awful, the grading is completely inconsistent, he's hard to understand because of his accent and he's extremely rude sometimes. Don't expect help from him!! He is an awful professor and I wish I never took him. SAVE YOURSELF THE PAIN!!",0
"Singer is an excellent teacher. Whether or not you're interested in the course material, she makes the course worth attending, and chooses excellent texts to work with. Easy marker, but a stickler for grammar!",1
"I loved his class. He is a good teacher will explain things if you ask. His test are hard. He words them a certain way, but sticks to the material covered in class. He doesn't just hand you a multiple choice test. He makes you think so you actually need to study for his exams. I would take him again if I was still in school!!",1
Whitekettle was supppppper funny! His lectures can be long but he adds a lot funny personal stories! He surprises you in class because it gets boring but then he'll suddenly say or do something that is hilarious! He is super helpful on Papers and is willing to extend due dates if you have a meltdown. His tests come straight form notes and are easy.,1
"She is a great teacher; you really learn a lot from her. However, extremely tough grader. Forgot to round my decimals on an excel hw assignment worth a test grade, everything else was correct, and was given a D on the assignment. She's very strict. This class gave me anxiety",0
"Nice guy but his lectures are dull. He's a CS professor so he expects students to have a background understanding on CS. If you don't, this will be difficult. The homework is fairly easy and sparse. Not sure how his tests will be, haven't had one yet. He emphasizes that his tests are dependent on his lectures, not the textbook. We'll see.",0
"Here's the thing: she's not terrible. Her mannerisms and the way she talks takes getting used to, but she is regular. If you get stuck with her, it's not bad. If you have the chance to change, I would do it. Also, she says ""you're exactly right"" ALL THE TIME. She's not bad, just not good.",0
"She is so bad. Doesn't teach you anything, if you don't know how to do makeup or sew youre on your own. You learn mostly through videos that are 15 + years old, and if you do something wrong its always your fault because you didn't pay attention. She treats her students like crap. If she continues to work here, the students will suffer even more.",0
"She often delivers lectures but unfortunately, most of the class isn't listening. She is a decent teacher but I feel like I am back in high school, passed out on a desk, when I am in her class. She is a very nice person and perhaps, if you really care about the course work, she might be very helpful.",1
Didn't help! she expected us to know everything overnight,0
Final Exam was open book open notes but ridiculously hard. It was not a test about how well you knew the subject but more about how fast you could find answers. Great person and very fun on field trips but not the best teacher.,0
"Singer was nice, and once you get the basic concepts she has good ideas to work with, but she's not great at explaining the basics. She thinks her views are the only correct views, and will mark you down for expressing things in a way she wouldn't. Not the worst prof, but not my fave.",1
In the process of dropping this class right now. I am a senior at UNCP and I have a 4.0. I am a finance major and I took this class for one of my science gen ed classes. It doesn't matter how hard you study and your book will not have your answers. I am struggling to get a C in this class. I have never received a C on anything in my entire life!,0
"-Yes lectures are long ( YT /user/profjpearce/videos), but it helped me to watch the recordings over a few times rather than attending live. -Yes Jedi is difficult (custom built on top of Scala) -Exams are REALLY difficult and due to the weighting, worth a LOT -Recordings def helped w Jedi (being able to see his code) -Answers emailed Qs thoroughly",1
Prof. Lohrey is always ready and willing to answer any questions you have. That is mostly how he runs his class-he wants you to go in and ask questions about anything you have trouble with. Do the Wiley homework because it WILL help you on the tests. He even told us exactly which kind of problems were going to be on the test!!! That helped A LOT.,1
Dr. Schwartz is not an easy teacher but he cares about his students. He wants to make sure you know the material so he is a tough grader but fair. I can say that I am well prepared for the classes to follow.,1
"Awesome Professor, she really cares about teaching her students instead of actually testing. She makes a course have a very well feeling which makes you want to speak and discuss your thoughts about the topic with the class.",1
Professor Borst is easily the best professor I have ever had. She is very caring and funny and makes class really enjoyable. She really cares about her students and helps you in any way possible. Great class to take!,1
Wish he were I,1
"Words to describe Jean Humphreys as a professor: moody, disorganized, forgetful, unwilling, rude, boring, irresponsible, etc.",0
I agree with what the other person wrote. If you're not a cop don't bother he doesn't care and you're not going to do well.,0
"If you're taking this class to fill a core, think again. Provost is a geniunely nice guy, now that we got that out of the way. Multiple questions assigned every class (Marked very hard), a 10 page paper (9 sources needed), and get ready to be serenaded by his voice considering all he does is lecture all class #yawn. This class is reading heavy!!!!!",0
Probably the driest lecturer I've ever had. He scribbles illegible things on the whiteboard while droning on. None of his in class examples are fully thought out or explained well. His slides are useless. You have a better chance of winning the lottery then gauging what could be on the exam. The information that he tests you on is pure memorization,0
Awesome prof who is willing to help you out if you ask for it. You have to work for your grade but the grading is definitely fair.,1
"Spectacular prof. He will definitely wake you up at 8.30. I'm not into accounting at all (econ. major), but I loved his class. The homework assignments aren't that tough, he's often in his office, and has very interesting case studies in the wake of corp. scandals. Grading is fair (emphasis on tests). I want Thibodeau as a motivational coach.",1
"I took his class during the pandemic and he made the online lectures so interesting and meaningful. I've never taken Neuroscience before and I loved how he presented the information in a clear, straight-forward, and easy to understand manner. He is also very receptive to student feedback and gave us multiple opportunities for extra credit",1
"She is unclear & unorganized. My grade has been the same for the past 3 months. She grades almost nothing, & what she does grade is graded poorly with no explanation or feedback. We are basically done with this semester & I literally have no idea whether I will finish with a 95% in the class, or with a 25%. The only thing I can say to you is RUN!",0
"He's a nice prof, but papers/ Exams grading are unfair and heavy.",0
"All of these good reviews below are fake/made by him or his favorite students. Ahmad is the worst professor you could have for orgo. The man cant even speak English properly and his hand writing is terrible. He does not care about his students. If u want to help or protect your GPA dont take him. He ruined my 4.0 GPA with a 3.0, but i deserved 3.7.",0
"Very nice guy, and knows the material well; however chemistry is not an easy subject, and he knows it. If needed he will help you as much as possible online & offline. Also exams are accumulative and are worth more as you go, so set time aside to study for these. He grades according to the classes performance. I would recommend him.",1
"oh my dear...horrible horrible horrible. i have no idea how he got into education. he speaks in a diffferent language and he might be brillant, but he has a bunch of useless knowledge that cannot teach the class..seriously.. if you're smart..avoid. he's rude too.",0
His 5631 is highly related to distributed systems and cloud computing.  This helps me A LOT with the job hunting.   I am now in Seattle !,1
"let me start off on saying how im a straight A student my whole life. i managed to FAIL this class. she eye ball grades each lab, you'll never get higher than a 6/10, lucky if you get a 7. her tests are crazy heavy and the average is always 60%/lower. she does not respond or fix anything, she'll mark you 0 on accident and wont fix it. SAVE UR GPA!",0
"Professor Wright is always accessible out of class and for the most part responds to emails very quickly. She at times is a little dull but I would take over again because she really does care about her students. Although she assigned a lot of homework, it prepares you for the exam. She also gives extra credit.",1
Could be a great class if she stop talking bad about other regions and saving North America and Europe from it. Well Ms. all regions have good and bad sides. Take someone else if you can. ,0
"Terri Renner is by far the worst teacher I have ever had at IU. She does not understand that life happens and some students need exceptions. Literally had 3 seizures and did not get any extension or anything. SHE IS HORRIBLE! SO much homework, and exams do not reflect the book or homework. DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR EVER!!! You will regret it!",0
"If she teaches a class, take it with her. She is a wonderful teacher and really works with you to set you up for success. I can't say enough great things about her.",1
"I don't know if she's off this semester or if it's normal for her, but this instructor turned out to be wishy-washy and unorganized. CONSTANTLY changing things, deletes instructions, discussion boards, announcements so you cannot reference what she said when she marks you down WRONGFULLY. Expects citations but does not understand them herself. Mess",0
"The actual worst to be honest. The class is unnecessarily hard. Her tests are ambiguous and no matter how much extra credit you do, you will more than likely do poorly because the is the worst grader. They don't match the material at all. POSC200 is a gen ed and counts toward certain majors/minors. If you don't have to take her, don't.",0
"Sweet lady! Very smart, but teaches as if we already know the material. I somehow passed her class, with lots of praying and extra credit. Wouldn't take her again, her teaching style isn't the best, especially with such a difficult subject.",0
Teacher is very down to earth and funny. Humour can be kind of dark but it suits the topics quiet well. I feel like I really learned something and also enjoyed myself. No regrets taking classes with him. I like when he has group discussions as well I think more teachers should allow group discussions.,1
"I have to agree! An easy A, but she's so unorganized and off the wall. Just smile & nod, you'll get by fine with her.",0
decent pro in math1221 but do not take math1222,0
"Cindy is adorable! She brightens up the room with her positivity and encouragement. I really enjoyed having her as a professor. Her feedback is minimal though, which made it difficult to improve my work. But, I would definitely take her class again and would recommend her to anyone!",1
"Professor eves just lectures for the whole class period and half the time it just long boring tangents. He posts the power points so you literally dont have to go to class. His papers arent that difficult, but he is a hard grader especially on the work sheets. I wouldnt take this class again",0
"Usually interesting lectures, and the material is fascinating (at least to me), so it'd be hard to screw it up.  His powerpoints are kind of bland (black text, white background), but he is a good enough speaker to make up for it.  Readings in 130 were almost identical to lecture content. 237 was probably my favorite class ever. Write well, get As.",1
"I took his spring Edu Psychology course and honestly it wasn't that bad. He makes his lectures interesting and there are only three papers and four exams in the class. You definitely have to read the book if you want to pass as well as listen to his lectures though attendance isn't mandatory. Also, he provides study guides for each exam. ",1
"Difficult to understand the lectures, frustrating to work on tedious projects that aren't graded for content (why bother?) A good suggestion would be to use the Blackboard site more, the calender and grade features especially would be helpful.",0
"I took Dr. Warner for Intro to Pop Culture. It was a 2hr 45min class and very boring. I personally did not like the content, was not what I was expecting. He does not use PowerPoint so it's just him talking. Grades on consist of one paper, midterm, and final. Bad at responding to emails. He's a wonderful person, but a boring class.",1
"Excellent professor that I recommend to anyone.  He is very clear, helpful, and uses real life examples to make his points. He knows how to explain things in your level so you can understand his materials. I will take every class he is offering for my major.",1
"Gardner is a tough grader. He gives good feedback, but extremely hard to get an A in his class. Attendance, and participation is mandatory.",0
"Awesome guy, awesome prof! He's hilarious and witty, and really knows what he's talking about.  Gives great examples and feedback. He's really open minded about writing and loves things that are out of the ordinary or normal things twisted around.  Take his class if you like writing!!",1
"Not quality. She is random during her lectures, and the online assignments do not match up at all with what she says in class. She does give out study guides for tests though which is helpful. I recommend not taking any notes at her lectures, just make sure you do the online stuff. The final is a group project that sucks.",0
"This teacher is the worst one I've had in the Comm Department so far. Her practice tests online are super easy and then when you get the in class quiz, they are much harder. This course is only two credits and she makes it way harder than it should be. Impossible to get an A. ",0
"MalgrÃ© le fait que c'Ã©tait la prof la plus sÃ©vÃ¨re que j'ai eu dans toute ma vie universitaire, j'ai Ã©normÃ©ment appris parce qu'elle m'a poussÃ© Ã  la rÃ©flexion et Ã  l'analyse toujours plus profonde. Je ne recommande pas le cours Ã  ceux qui ne pourraient pas s'ajuster Ã  la charge de travail. ",1
All you need to know about Dr. Mitchell in four words. Best teacher out there.,1
"Mr. Wilson was cool. Only problem that I truly had was his lack of grading throughout the course. Since the class is based on writing, you don't really know what your grade is until the end of the semester. Fortunately, I received a B in the class, but was aiming for an A. If grades matter to you, do not take him. If not, go for it. Good luck!",0
"DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR!!!!!! He is extremely rude, does not know how to lecture, and will not explain anything to you. You can not understand anything he says, he sits in the front of the class and mumbles for 2 straight hours. All the homework and quizzes are online and just take a lot of time to do.",0
Carol is a sweet lady who cares about her students. She has a tendency to ramble and can be boring at times. The homework was extremely hard. Tests are not so much based on knowledge as memorization.,1
"This professor is absurd. He doesn't know how to teach a class. I am appalled he is allowed to be a professor. Don't take a class with him unless you don't care about learning the material, and enjoy doing lots of pointless, busy work.",0
"Each class almost entirely depended on knowing how to do Model UN beforehand so that you could participate in the simulations, which was kind of pointless if the class is an hour and 15 min long twice a week and the simulations dont carry over to the next class. Failed me on final paper with unclear guidelines.",0
"Not a good prof at all.. tests never graded within a month etc. Doesnt say what material will be on following tests just a broad ""understand c"" etc.",0
he lost my paper and gave me a bad grade,0
I had her a little over a year back but she's still one of my favorite instructors and is the kindest person I've met here.,1
"Always open to help, organized and has fun teaching his class. It was never boring in his class and as long as you attend and DO all of the work, you will pass!!",1
her grading system makes no sense and I have never had more panic attacks than I did this semester when taking her. do not take her. worst prof at westconn.,0
The group project takes an INSANE amount of time. The project is also graded very heavily. Don't expect a good mark for this course. Salustri's lectures are interesting though.,1
"Robbi works to make her students' lives miserable.  She is a terrible role model, and is destroying the nursing interest.  Her tests are on how well you can take a test, not on any of her lecture material.  Lots of work, stress and headaches.",0
"You get a mixed bag with Finley.  You will learn a lot about the texts he loves, but not about Walcott or Joyce.  He did not cover the theory as well or helpfully as the other section.  He can also be weirdly personal in his comments in class and on your papers.  If you have a tough skin, you can ignore them.  If not, you will be traumatized.",0
"She moves way too fast, it is really impossible to keep up with her. I think she is good for more advanced students. She also seems bored.",0
His notes are impossible to read. His lecture is just you sitting there and him reading something to you he wrote 50 years ago in chicken scratch. He is older than dirt and I wouldn't be in the least suprised if he croaks during a lecture one day.,0
"(part 2) Cons(2): For each questions he gives only TWO answer choices in sample exam (SE) but the problem is many times the answer to a particular question is NOT there, so you have to find it either online or in his Handouts. Cons (3) Roughly 5% of the questions on the exam are completely unfair, which makes it impossible to get a 100 or even a 95",1
"Dr.Edminston has a great interest in his subject of chemistry. While his thoughts in class and notes seem jumbled in class, they make sense when looking back at them later. He was always willing to answer questions in class, and also willing to meet outside of class to provide extra help. He was great!",1
"I took 5 classes with Mike. He completely rocked my world-view. If you want a class that can change your life, take one from him. He is a nut, but any teacher who will throw a desk on the ground during class kicks butt in my book!",1
"He is there for you, both academically and spiritually.",1
He has a different sense of humor and he is kinda weird. But I love it. Possibly my favorite professor at Ferris.,1
"From the very beginning of the course, Scordilis comes off as difficult. Your grade for the course is based entirely on Scordilis. He doesn't take time to know most of his students and you never know what you'll be doing next in class. Look out for when he's in a bad mood as he often projects onto his students and is very impatient. Pay attention.",0
He can be very odd and hard to listen to at times but he is overall a very genuine guy. He will talk about his personal life a lot just a warning. He SO passionate about writing.  I would take him again,1
She is a nightmare. She is so vague and her lectures are extremely boring. She gives assignments at the last minute with very little explanation. She is very disorganized so you never know when things are due or what is expected of you. She is also very inaccessible and useless if you need help.,0
"In a word: awesome. She is crazy smart and basically overflows with info, I had her for Chaucer and she taught us more than the book ever could on its own. She's definitely into quizzing and she loves a good discussion so speak up in class and if you're confused SAY SOMETHING. She's more than willing to help out. Would definitely take her again.",1
"BE PREPARED TO WORK. HW can be confusing and take a little longer than expected, but you will learn. PA's are long and tough, do not wait to start on them. Tests are not too bad, just make sure you understand the homeworks and review all his material. His test reviews/ practice problems helped me. Tells you to get the textbook, but I never used it.",1
"Worst teacher ever. Horrible enlgish and he is very soft spoken so you cannot hear him. Test are no longer online, and he will tell you that if you do not pass the first exam there is no hope in passing the course. He does not curve or help you out by giving extra points during the semester.",0
"I've never met another professor who has put in as much effort at Prof. Yue. She is a very caring prof who gives it her all so that her students can get the most out of class and do well. She is always there to help you with anything you need. Lots of work (presentations, dialogue performances, quizzes and workbook HW) but you'll learn for sure.",1
"Jesse, although quite quirky, is a great guy. He knows what he is talking about, and is very insightful. If you do the work and take his advice, you'll do great. You may have to laugh at jokes you don't understand, but he will like you!",1
"Professor Hansen is by far my favorite professor at this school. She is always prepared, informative, and amazing at explaining legal concepts in a way that's easy to understand, especially since this was my first class in law school. Awesome, awesome, awesome!!!",1
"If you want to spend your time looking at Catholic interpretations of Shakespeare, this class is for you. If you are slightly progressive, I would advise you to look somewhere else. Constant half-funny / off-putting remarks. Besides from that, there is rarely open-minded discussion, but rather Lockerd talking about his favorite lines.",0
AMAZING! I would take his class again if I could. I am not a history major and i was captivated by his lectures. He is passionate and extremely enthusiastic. He has the best gestures and jokes too! you will love him,1
"Super fun and educational course! As long as you turn in your easily weekly assignments and pay attention to lectures :-) Dr. Monroe will keep you awake, and the material is very interesting!",1
"He is so much fun in class, but talking to him outside of class you feel like there isn't anything that he doesn't know about. He is so genuine and helpful. I love this prof.",1
"I enjoyed his class, hes very clear on explaining the material and brakes every topic piece by piece for a better understanding, he does give 3 quizzes and alot of reading is required, MUST STUDY KEY TERMS they will definitely be on test. Hes also very funny. American politics is a hard class but with his teaching i passed with a B.",1
i would not recommend taking this class if you are new to writing or not very good at writing. he provides very little guidance and does not like to respond to emails. His lectures were just him giving Purdue OWL links and expecting you to figure the rest out. all of his assignments were for completion and he provided little to no feedback.  ,0
"CLASS WAS A BREEZE. SHE IS A GREAT PROFESSOR. STUDY, STAY CAUGHT UP ON YOUR WORK AND YOU SHOULD BE FINE.",1
"Markham is a great professor. She truly cares about her students, but she forces you to work for it. You definitely earn the grade you receive. She encourages students to come for office hours. Added a bonus homework and dropped our lowest score for homeworks. 3 tests and a final all worth 100 points each. Truly a great professor if you work hard.",1
"Professor Vannozzi is a really nice guy who will go out of his way to even give you a ride home if you needed it, but when it comes to his class get ready for long lectures and lots of memorization of him talking. He is a very picky grader, but it overall prepares you for the real world and how some companies pay close attention to detail.",1
"I hate to be rude because, to be honest: he seems nice. I can see why people like him. However, I had to drop this class; I was getting so much anxiety from this. Didn't answer my e-mails. Lectures go off-topic. Could barely understand the concepts but didn't want to fail. Maybe he's better when teaching easier classes, but 210 is not it. Sorry.",0
"hard class.  material wasnt that clear.  his tests suck.  they were tough.  but this was back in 2001, it may have changed.  he wants you to know lots of details and be able to apply the material.  he has a great presence in the classroom.  he is lively, e",1
"Professor Mitchell is a solid choice to fulfill the Elements of Political Theory requirement. He is somewhat full of himself, and I did not really learn anything from actually being in class. However, the books we read were very foundational and useful. We only had three papers, and they were quite easy, so the class was easy overall.",1
she was a amazing prof! she was always willing to help me whenever i asked. i was in her office almost everyday before class and she ways always willing to help me understand!,1
"Lots of Papers, Tests, and skewed personal views. Just no.",0
"Public Relations was a great course; we put together the Turkey Bowl. He appreciates students who think outside of class, who challenge themselves to think outside of their comfort zones to do the best job possible. He is always available after class, and even called me after scheduled classes to answer a question I had in class! A great man.",1
"Homework requires precise  offline submission. If output on homework doesn't exactly match confusing specifications there will be a 70 point penalty, and upon resubmitting within a week you can expect a 20 point penalty. Averages on exams: 667165(10 free points). No form of scaling. If you haven't take AP Java don't expect higher than a C.",0
"He uses MyMathLab for all homework assignments. If you dont get a certain score on homework, you have to do it over and over again until you get his desired score. Sometimes its 10 questions sometimes its 50. Would not recommend If you struggle with math because he is no help.",0
Amazing teacher and class! Attendance is not taken but her lectures are very interesting and useful for test. Three online exams that were fairly easy if you attended classes and took notes. She cares so much about the material and makes it an enjoyable and easy class. Would strongly recommend!,1
Dr. Michele Ramsey is the most horrible professor at Penn State Berks.,0
"I'll always remember the class when she explained the Pumping Lemma... ""We want to pump the tree"" and ""We want the tree to be fully bushy""... First X-rated CS course at Waterloo",1
"Good class, good professor. I took him first thing in the morning in the summer and was usually pretty entertained by his stories. Don't hold off on the quizzes, the book is necessary for those, the final was so long and tediously laid out that I quit really trying but still got an A, I definitely feel more competent in the subject.",1
Thinks teaching consists of asking 'what else?'  Wouldn't know a good discussion if it came up and bit him on the butt.  Nice truck.,0
"This professor only has lectures once a week and made them entertaining and easy to understand, participating in class can get you a lot of extra credit points. For this class, you are mostly working with the GA, they do most of the grading, meetings, and answering questions. The setup of this class was kind of strange but was a manageable A.",1
"I took this class online and was much easier! I took Econ 2301 and 2302. I took five classes aside of these and I was able to pass both classes with A's!!! She's a great professor and responds emails really quick!!! If you really have to take this class,I would recommend you to take her online!!! Expect homework cause you will have some. Not hard! ",1
"Dr. Blair is knowledgeable but old-school. He only grades on attendance and two in-class essays. He is a fun guy to talk with, but I'm not terribly impressed by his teaching.",0
"Great professor. Notifies students of scholarships as well as job and internship opportunities in lecture frequently. His ""celebrations of knowledge"" are pretty difficult and usually contain a lot of material, but they are manageable and he has curved before. He has a lot of experience in his field and always has a fun plant story to tell in class!",1
"Nice lady, didn't retain much information. Wish she included translations on the screen of her lectures as her accent is extremely hard to understand. Not hard at all if you moderately apply yourself. She's pretty clear about her objectives and doesn't assign much work. Its really up to you to study. Take her for the ""A"", don't take her to learn.",0
"good and helpful professor. notes in class are important! gives studyguides for every exam, and easy to do homework and quizzes. lots of extra credit opportunities!!!",1
"Rossi is my department head and is the most unorganized human being I've ever seen.  His lectures revolve only around social mobility, and he  emails readings sometimes an hour before they're due.  I read more for this than my 400 level courses, and I walk away with so much less from this stupid course.  A waste of a History major's time.",0
"He's a very interesting professor. There are professors who may teach a bit better, but Dr. Anikovskiy makes the material so interesting and is super helpful if you ask or email him questions. He released all his notes before the final exam, which really helped. Would definitely give him a 5 if he made slides for his entire part of the course!",1
"This class was by no means difficult. He gives three absences until grade deductions occur, but you can write a formal letter to have them adjusted baring a good reason. The lectures do drone on, but show up and act like you care and it'll benefit you. He let me turn in my paper two weeks late because I explained my situation and showed him respect",1
DO NOT TAKE THAT CLASS IF YOU ARE NOT GOOD AT MATH YOU WILL FAIL. MAKES MATH REALLY HARD. SHE TEACHES REALLY FAST AND YOU DONT HAVE A CHANCE TO ASK QUESTIONS. ALSO EXTREMELY TOUGH GRADER. ONE SMALL MISTAKE CAN CAUSE YOU ALL POINTS. DOESNT GIVE YOU EXTRA WORK AND NO MAKEUP. SHE GIVES POP QUIZZES WHICH ONLY ONE STUDENT PASSES FROM THE ENTIRE CLASS.W,0
"This class was VERY HARD. I got a D on every test. I am typically an A student and was at risk of failing. He does curve the class but it is still hard. For someone who is not a science major, I would not recommend this class. I feel he lectured on unnecessary information and test questions were random. Extra credit given at end if needed.",0
"this class is easy. I never showed up and almost got an A. there's lots of reading but you can skim through it and understand. I did not enjoy his class AT ALL, how much he talks about himself or off topic conversations in class is ridiculous and the reason why I stopped attending class. Basically taught myself everything I needed.",0
"Took the hybrid epi course. You have to teach yourself everything b/c she won't lecture/have discussions in class. Visuals help with epi but her ppts lack them. Agree with the others, very lengthy project and not helpful when you ask her questions. No study guide either. Your best bet is to memorize the textbook for exams.",0
Grading criteria very very unclear. Short answers on tests are really awful. She did not post past tests/resources. She only made the launch pad available. No feedback on tests. Took 2 weeks to mark a test that was online with only 3 short answers. I wish she was more caring...,0
"Professor Engerer is the WORST professor I have ever had. DO NOT take him. He loves watching his students fail. Horrible, just horrible.",0
"He does requires you to have your camera. There are a lot of opportunities for extra credit, and all quizzes and test are open book. The are a lot of group projects, so just make sure you all communicate and you'll be fine. The final exam is on Cengage. He did not make it up, and he will mention it. The screens are sensitive so just be careful.",1
"He is very nice. looks like dog the bounty hunter. class is very easy. prepare to hear him speak and he repeats stories and jokes that arent funny. not very clear on a lot, like he says theres extra credit, when actually its a question not worth as much as the others. attendance is a must. over all hes a easy and fun, kinda boring class",1
Very unspecific grading. Overall nightmare experience.,0
"DLD is an easy concept, and should all in all be an enjoyable class for EE, CPE's considering what we're about to face.  He takes the 'f' out of the 'fun class.'",0
"I took this class face-to-face, but hardly ever had to attend. I used class time to read the chapter, and the exams were online. If you read the book you will get an A.",1
"Doesn't explain criteria explicitly for assignments, difficult to understand what she's looking for. hard to get extra help because she seems to think everyone should know what she knows after multiple degrees",0
Funny teaching style,1
"Mr. Gavner is one of the best teachers Ive had so far this year. He makes the class entertaining and fun. If he had another course, I would take it in a heartbeat!!!",1
He assigns a bunch of books that you have to read and then asks questions about the books. I never had enough time to finish reading the books before the next quiz came along. The final is all of the quizzes in a bunch but it's multiple choice unlike the quizzes that you have to fill in the blank.. sadly I did not pass this class.,0
"Hes very rude. Will take off points over the littlest things. Has no filter. Dont know why hes a professor. He has a big attitude problem. He likes to put students on the spot. Will grade you on your participation. Dont even bother taking him if you have things going on in your personal life. Hes inconsiderate. Also, good luck on the essays.",0
"It is so disappointing that EWU lets this teacher teach at all. I have taken this class at another school and understood it very well, now I am in it here with this teacher and it is impossible to understand or learn anything. He does not grade anything or give any feedback. He also wont work with you on ANYTHING. Avoid this teacher at all costs.",0
"Very evident his political views and grades papers accordingly. Not a fan of this guy. On the bright side, few assignments.",0
Great instructor!  He is down to earth and teaches material as you would use it in the real world.  He makes class fun and helps you understand everything clearly.  I was very impressed!  Would definitely reccommend taking his class.,1
"The Almighty Duba. You clap when this man enters the room... you fricken clap. He hates it when we clap, but we must for our lord and savior. In all seriousness, this man loves his job and loves his class and loves his students. He is just a blast to have as a professor. Could improve on lecturing, but he is enjoyable.",1
"Worst professor I've ever had. I highly recommend avoiding her as professor because I will never be taking a course taught by her again. She was EXTREMELY rude and condescending to myself and several of my classmates. If your looking for a smart and kind professor who cares about their students, I recommend any other professor at WLU.",0
This professor goes off on wild tangents during lectures and teaches you very little if you somehow manage to maintain focus and listen.  You would be better off doing any other option other than taking a course with this professor.  I literally taught myself the content out of the book and managed to squeeze by with a b,0
"great professor and helper, take his class if you can.",1
"Has thick accent, and can be hard to understand. Seems that she doesn't herself understand what she is teaching, especially if you ask her a question about what she's copying from her notes onto the board.",0
"I liked her a lot. Nice to talk to, intelligent, and had a really good grasp on the materials for the class that I took with her.",1
Confusing and unhelpful. Thinks she knows what she's talking about.  Go to the other coordinator if you need help.  Acts like a blonde.,0
"good teacher, not too clear on instructions and likes to hear herself talk (as garbled as it is). but very nice and helpful when you take intitiative",1
"doesn't answer emails and her rubrics are very vague, pointless, and don't make sense",0
You can learn from him as long as you take crazy detailed notes because the tests are super intense. He is hard to understand because of an Asian accent but is a good guy. Just not the greatest professor.,0
"She's terrible. I received A's in all my classes this semester with 16 credit hours, and she gave my a low C. Doesn't matter if you get perfect scores on all the quizzes (which are insanely difficult) if you get low test scores, you will get a terrible grade. BY FAR the hardest teacher I had in my college career. UNWILLING TO HELP STUDENTS!",0
"Tangant inceptions- he goes off on tangents within his tangents ""a room full of estrogen."" , a quote in the beginning of the year the way that he comes across makes you feel uncomfortable. Hes very loud, I feel like Im going to go deaf. half the time he doesnt even know what hes doing.",0
"Maybe it was just me but I was bored out of my mine in this class he has a strong accent, he just talks and talks with out letting u get a word in about what he's speaking on as he's speaking on it. In overall hated this class. No lap tops no cell phones but others in class said they would take him again just because they know what to expect.",0
"15% of the grade was weekly discussion posts, which were 3 pages of single spaced writing each week. A ton of work for a small return. Tough marking. Feedback wasn't given, so you had no idea how you were doing  Midterm was incredibly specific. Very fact based.  Paper was poorly outlined. He was reluctant to answer questions with any detail.",0
"I would NEVER recommend Prof Keyes. She had an attitude all the time, seemed to hate teaching! The first 1/2 of the semester was easy if you did the work but when it got harder she did less and less explaining. Tests were HARD and projects/lab were VERY time-consuming. Can't stand her, and I got a D which brought my GPA down! DONT TAKE HER CLASS",0
"Over 100 sapling assignments, live class, pre-recorded lectures, and four exams for the semester",0
Hard stuff. Wish he would actually listen to opinions.,0
"Well, his class is easy but he can't teach. If you want taking his class, You MUST STUDY by YOURSELF in order to succeed. I like the way he gave more time on the webwork but he REALLY CAN""T EXPLAIN ANY CONCEPT. Also, he usually makes mistakes on the questions that we ask in the class.",0
He is a great professor. He really knows the field and continues to expand his own education within Emergency Management/ Terrorism. I learned a large amout within this class in a small amount of time (I took the May-mester),1
I love her and truly valued what I learned in her classes. The readings were really interesting and the assignments are very open to explore whatever interests you may have. She is very open to giving feedback and helping with assignments. By far one of my favourite professors at York!,1
"Roy is an astoundingly smart man, therefore he explains concepts very vaguely while writing out proofs and constantly saying it's simple, when it seems like rocket science. Tests are unpredictable and the textbook will be absolutely essential to passing. Do not be intimidated by the first couple chapter's problems, study hard, and look for a curve.",0
Professor Vavova is amazing. She is very clear about what she wants. A lot of group presentations but those are not graded. She'll make sure you know what you are learning.,1
"She doesnt initially teach the material very well, but if you ask questions she does a good job of explaining things in a different way. I can understand why people dont like her. If you value understanding the material and put in a little effort, youll do just fine in this class.",0
"A very rude, unkind, and unhelpful professor. Responses to questions through email and Piazza are frequently terse, sarcastic, and insulting. Assignments and exams are brutal. Perhaps his lectures make up for it, somehow. I wouldn't know. But I'll be very glad to never encounter him again.",0
"She is very kind-hearted and honest. Also, she is very detailed and straight forward about the grading scale and class assignments (homework, test, projects, debates) that will be taken place inside class. She also puts herself in students shoes and tries to make class easy-going yet informational. She sets you up to succeed. Highly Recommend!",1
"Test questions ridiculous, easy to follow...ALL about the overheads",1
I'm an alum and he is definitely one of Bowdoin's best!!,1
Save yourself the struggle and take Ryba. She uses his material anyways except Ryba is much clearer and actually knows how to explain the topics well. Take her only if for some reason you have to retake the course and you know half of the material already.,0
"She's actually the nicest professor I've ever had. She really cares for her students and really helps you in order to do your best. There are no tests and essays are not bad at all. I really recommend to take her, she's literally the sweetest. def recommend",1
One she showed up to class in an Apache helicopter in full army fatigues. Stay away!,0
"Notes reflected in exams. Helps students, monotone voice, attendence required.",1
"I really liked Professor Lowell. Class is basically mandatory if you want to pass, but I looked forward to it. He gives a pretty routine schedule each week, with a few projects thrown in here and there. He is super nice and makes class enjoyable. The only downside is that he's a tough grader and some projects/assignments were not explained well.",1
"He is the most specific grader I have every seen.  He docks off points for the way one writes their symbols.  I once overheard him tell a student that he will give him/her a zero on the test if he/she writes too small for his liking.  He seems passionate about math and one's understanding of the material.  Good guy, awful grader.",0
Very good teacher. She brings lot of materials. Always answers emails.,1
Abosolutely cool,1
I took the summer class and really enjoyed it.  I'm sure if I had to deal with this class for 15 weeks though I'd just lose my mind.  But I think he's a fabulous professor.,1
He has a dry sense of humour and means well when he talks to students. Beware though as he will follow through with anything he says. Likes to play mind games on students.,1
"THE BEST PERSON ON THIS PLANET. Fun guy to talk to and hang out with. Really funny and interesting. Would highly recommend him, really knows his information.",1
Very tough prof.. make sure to attend every class or else you will pay the price.,0
"I took his 8 am this semester, and despite not being a morning person this class was definitely worth it. The class content is super exciting and Professor Tierney is a fantastic teacher who really cares about his students. There is a lot of reading so you do need to put a decent amount of time outside of class.",1
Good class to take online. STUDY!,1
Seriously though she does not know how to teach. It surprises me that they assigned her to teach a bio class for non-majors. Everything I know if from prior knowledge but somehow she doesn't know how to explain things properly in biology. She's very vague and will rush through things. Clicker questions and hw's take 30 minutes twice a week busywor,0
the way she thinks is so ridiculous. I can hardly believe that I willingly signed up for such a class. She also sometimes thinks that your not right when in reality you are.,0
"Her exams were pretty difficult, but she's a really good lecturer and a really fun and helpful person in general. She also gives some pretty good extra credit. I took her class during covid, so i don't know if this is usually the case, but i didn't find the textbook very helpful. Usually all the stuff you need is in her lectures.",1
Gives way too many assignments. As a science major I barely have time as is with all my lab reports. I have written more papers in this class than all other classes combined. There is no need for this,0
She is a horrible professor and shouldn't be teaching. She is a very tough grader and doesn't teach a lot in her classes. All she does is read of the powerpoint and the material on the test isn't anything we talked about in class.,0
"The only reason I liked taking his class, was because attendance is not mandatory. If you've taken calc before, take this class, otherwise you're going to struggle. He gives 2 tests and a final, and that's your grade.",0
"Easy A.  All you need to do is speech. Try to speech convincingly, You will win his heart. ",1
ridiculous professor. tries so hard to be funny and the jokes are exactly what you would expect from an old man. dry and boring.he spends so much time bs-ing he doesn't even cover the material. incomprehensible in his mumbo jumbo he says and so full of energy i just want to pop. never had other profs in this field but surely there are better,0
"Granted there was little psychology in the course, the class remained very interesting. There is a ton of reading, but he covers much of the important material in his lectures. I rarely read and managed just fine.  If you are a strong writer and attend class, essays are not very difficult. Course starts off boring, but gets pretty interesting.",1
"I am taking his class and I would not recommend him. He is a smart guy but he cannot teach. It feels like he thinks he is a Harvard professor but in actuality, a community college teacher. He grades unfairly, takes points off of the simplest things, makes you feel that you're wasting your time at office hours. Pick a different teacher!",0
"I would never take this professor again. She is extremely unorganized and does not want students contacting her. She does not leave her number or email. You can reach her through the WWCC website; however, she will not respond. She wants students to ask questions through discussions. Her response time is late and does not explain her grading.",0
"I couldn't believe it....the videos she passed were awsome, the book we had to read was very informative, but her lectures were dry, unclear and completely unorganized.  I never thought such an interesting subject could be taught so poorly...",0
"Professor Dimkoff tries his hardest to help his students succeed. Gregg is the cutest guy and really gives insurance some life. As long as you pay attention in class and take good notes, there's not much of a need to take notes outside of class. I definitely suggest using the practice tests. Your grade is based on your rank within your class.",1
"Espo was a great professor. He is very intimidating at first, and you will feel like dropping out in the beginning. However, the hw and tests are very concise, and if you do the work and reading the class is great. He is very engaging and I really learned a lot. He gives A LOT of extra credit.",1
"""Intructor First"". Never respond email. Not friendly. Not care about his student at all. Hard to get an A. Worst instuctor I ever seen. No practice exam. He only says,""the exam question is similar to your book's examples"" (I took CIS 20). Lecture is lack of organized. It is detailed but saying too much useless in class. HW are barely relate to exam",0
"His a good professor really funny, pretty chill and will help you develop your projects,really good feedback and is there for you to ask questions. Cares about your work he wants to see improvement and thought, and will call out if people are slacking. Feels a little useless to come to class sometimes but overall, great teacher, funny, good class",1
"Don't take this class if you're looking for an easy A. Kev's got a lot of passion for the material, but you won't get much if you can't reciprocate a love for extremely esoteric concepts. Take lot of notes; they'll help with studying for the exam, and keep you awake as his droning voice threatens to lull you to sleep. Technical errors are frequent.",0
"Lee is an amazing professor, he's extremely organized and helpful. Almost impossible to get below a 90% on the homework assignments. He's also funny and makes the class enjoyable",1
had her for contemporary women writers. it drove me crazy listening to her speak. she said nothing of importance. i watched the clock that entire class...books were decent though.,1
"Unless you're a cop don't bother taking his classes, he doesn't even want to know you exist.",0
"Andy Heard is a great professor, he does his best to make dry course material interesting. He also records his lectures and posts them to canvas which is extremely helpful when studying! He really cares about his students, 10/10 would recommend.",1
"Exams are entirely short answer, impossible, and makes you read the textbook like it's your day job. I can't explain how many times I couldn't stay awake in this guys class. Graded by very few things. NO!!!!!",0
Great teacher!! The class is really fun even if you don't like sewing. She is very helpful and really nice. Easy A if u like sewing.,1
Rudest and unhelpful professor ever. She's out of the country 2/3 of the semester and does not return grades on papers and midterms until almost the end of the semester. She never replies to emails and when she does she's so rude. The tests are impossible and not from the book. She does not care for students and does not deserve to be a professor. ,0
This class is super easy as long as you put in the work! Professor Lane adds in a little bit of humor and he's a sweet man. Does NOT like technology in his class (cell phones and computers). We have weekly quizzes and prompts which are quite easy! Attendance is a MUST if you miss more than 4 days your grade is automatically a B.,1
"For a Business Communication class that teaches how to communicate to stakeholders, Ball was surprisingly awful at communicating  contradicting information between Blackboard announcements, emails, and written notes, and had projects that required so much effort for so little grade weight. He's a great speaker, lecturer, and person, but.... yikes.",0
"Dr. Bauwens is the worst professor I have ever had. He is indifferent to student concerns, and at times, was outright disrespectful. His handwritten lecture notes were the only resource provided to students, He did not post his notes online and His tests followed very unusual formats. Bauwens did everything he could to set up his students to fail.",0
If you aren't interested in History do not take this course. Too much reading to do especially if you have more important classes to worry about. You basically teach yourself which sucks because for exams she says herself that she's a tough grader. The review sheets are difficult to complete and memorize for the exams. Impossible course. AVOOOIIDD!,0
"Honestly don't even know where to start with this guy. He's unorganized, rude, boring, and seems inadequate for the position. During lectures, you can't help but notice how it seems like he has not clue what he is talking about and that observation is proven when someone in the class asks him a question or to elaborate more. Stay away!",0
"Frances isn't the most charismatic lecturer and that's okay! She provides a ""course packet"" which is an outline of every lecture. If you read the material before class it's easier to understand and take good notes. Reading and notes are KEY! There's no homework but for the 2 exams you'll need to know what you're talking about.",1
Frustrating class to say the least. Can't speak for how it's taught in person but online it's an absolute drag. Duggan rambles in his lectures and is unengaging to listen to. The tests and essays are graded to such a high standard that is near impossible to please because you are never given any type of rubric. Super pretentious class don't take it,0
She does not explain things very well at all. I was so confused on every single paper we wrote and when she is demonstrating how to do something in SPSS she goes fast through all of it and takes up all your work time. Very unclear on her instructions and tests are very difficult. Papers took her forever to grade and we almost never got out on time.,0
"Professor Wang is an excellent instructor. Class notes and answers to classwork are posted on Canvas. Her lectures were clear and, overall, helped me improve my math skills. This is an accelerated math class. If you are up for the challenge, this class is definitely worth taking.",1
"Very tough grader and very slow when it comes to getting a grade back from her. Not sure whether or not she should be teaching as she never says anything important. Also, don't skip class it counts against your grade if it wasn't for that I wouldn't attend class.",0
very knowledgable but the course just has alot of material that you have to go over which isn't her fault. she does a great job at making a tough course easier.,1
Dr. Lin is truly an amazing professor. You are very lucky to take a class with her. She is very precise and gives amazing lectures. She also gives you the chance to earn extra credit throughout the semester. You can reach out to her throughout the semester and she will be available. She is truly inspirational!,1
"Provides no real instruction for papers, makes her opinions of individual students painfully clear. Teaching style is bland and dry. If you have a sense of humor, you're gonna have a bad time.",0
"Misses tons of classes, very hard grader, her 100 point grading system is absolutely ridiculous and makes it hard to do well.  
 I'd avoid taking her in the future.",0
"Dingman is a wonderful professor. Don't let her easy-going attitude fool you, she's sharp as a tack! Her classes are typically discussion-based so get ready to talk, but if you read all the material that won't be too difficult. She never makes you feel stupid, but she does push you towards your potential.",1
"Found his lectures have no flow, it's difficult to follow what he's talking about. Tests are pretty hard, 31 multiple choice questions and 20 minutes to answer them. Can be funny at times, very dry sense of humour though. TA marked the papers really hard.",0
It's a pretty easier class. I used the book to study and that was all.,1
"I took this class because I was genuinely interested in learning about the topic. The workload is so crazy that I am thinking about withdrawing. With the stress of the pandemic and my other classes this class is unmanageable. The readings take hours, be warned!!!!",0
"Worst professor ive ever had. He is harsh with grading, we have weekly assignment based off our lecture videos & he looks for a specific answer and how much you write. I emailed him multiple times throughout the semester asking for help, therefore, he was not understanding at all and compared me to other students. I am one that usually does well.",0
"TAKE THIS CLASS!!! This was the coolest sophomore seminar ever! Professor Storey knows what she is talking about. She's a great professor, best class at DePaul so far. I wish she taught every class. She expects a lot, but that only makes class better. Don't take her class if you aren't willing to do the work. Highly recommend her!",1
Very rough professor. Not very understanding to personal issues that may impact class. Do not take,0
"Daily is an awesome professor. He gives very specific feedback on work, and if possible will even give page numbers to help you refine your work. 5/5. Also likes trains.",1
"Ms. Zimmerman is a nut, but in the best way. Always enjoyed listening to her teach, however- this class is impossible if you don't have previous exposure to an anatomy class in high school. The tests were multiple choice but the questions often had nothing to do with her powerpoint. There was only 1 midterm and 1 final but labs are key- know APA!!",1
"I absolutely hate this class and this professor. Not only is he a horrible teacher, but if you do bad on ONE test, he will tell you to re-evaluate your life. He does not know how to teach and he needs to leave Northwest because he is not approachable and makes students feel stupid. Do not take his class. Avoid him at all costs. HE IS HORRIBLE!",0
"Class was very easy! Two exams and one research paper (10-15 pages, and you choose the topic).  Exams come straight from class notes and the book, so make sure you read it.  He loves the little details and will take off points if you don't have them.  Best professor ever, I took him for POSC313 too and I hope to take him again!",1
"He's by far one of the best math professors, if you can take his class don't resist. He makes the subject clear and the class not difficult to pass. Just study and you will pass plus he makes the class pass by pretty fast.",1
"Dr. Schmuck is one of the smartest professors on campus. He's on a whole different level; if you're not paying attention, it'll all go over your head!",1
"He knows what he is talking about and (archaeoastronomy) the class is very interesting, but when it comes to the papers and grading... he knows much more about astronomy and archaeology. Otherwise, a very enjoyable experience.",0
"Advanced Criminology is required for all CJ majors, and if you can, take it with Prof. Kramer. Howard isn't bad so to say, he just has a rediculous amount of work required for an A. Attendance is marked as part of grade, must bring in a piece of paper about what you read each day (put into grade too), and talk each day or you lose points. Excessive",1
"The nature of the class is difficult (sight singing is really freaking difficult), but Dr. Norris does everything in his power to make it bearable. He gives extra credit and rewards hard work over perfection. That being said, his grading scale makes A's almost impossible to get. Expect to pass, but not to ace.",1
"Lectures cover the first few page of required reading. You end up reading, doing assignments, and taking tests online. I can do that online without having to show to class to hear my classmates anecdotes on their lives.",0
I am really glad I picked Dr. Brubeck. I learned a lot about music and enjoyed being in is his. I truly recommend it if you looking for a class to learn and enjoy,1
"I would not recommend her for online. There are only 2-3 assignments you have to complete, so you are completely relying on the lectures for when you get to the tests. She also talks very soft which makes watching her lectures online almost impossible. She grades very strictly as well.",0
"Professor Schaefer is a man out of the mid 20th century with outdated ideals that date back to the 1700s. He is admittedly very intelligent, but his personality and beliefs overshadow almost all of that virtue. His lectures lack thought provoking material and his assignments are only worth what you can regurgitate back to him.",0
"Amazing professor! She is so understanding and can really work with you. If you do put in the effort, youll get an A! In addition, you received your grade with feedback within 2 days!",1
"His class is meant for people who have never looked at a piece of sheet music before, so he's very thorough in explaining the basics. Sometimes he gets tongue-tied because of his accent, but it's not an issue. Some class work, your choice in getting the book because he posts everything on the board. Few easy assignments. Try to participate",1
"Katselis was one of my favorite professors. If you attend lectures, he will work with you to make sure you get all the material. The material is pretty dry, but he does the best he can to make it interesting.",1
"Communication is poor, but he makes up for it in his good looks.",1
"Dr. Haspel assigns journal assignments almost every class period, which are surprisingly fun and easy. He assigns 4 large papers a year, and no midterm. He is a great teach who is more than willing to help any student. He is also very funny and interesting to listen to.",1
"He's really awesome. His class is easy, just keep up with the journals. He gives plenty of extra credit! Take this class with him, you won't regret it!",1
Best instructor I've ever had,1
"Friendly lady, not a great teacher. Don't get me wrong, if we were out of the classroom I would be her friend. She does not say what she means when it comes to the assignments. Make sure you are thorough on your on account. She will act like it's all good, but when it comes down to grading she will say something like...well want I wanted was this..",0
Her assignments are very time consuming and she is a very picky marker. Her lectures are boring and she thinks that talking loudly will help us learn.,0
"Dr. Hewitt is in no way the easiest Prof at MSU. He cares deeply about his students and will arrange tutoring sessions with either himself or his G.A., whenever a student actually cares to make an effort. However, the book is horrible and is a requirement for the class. I can promise you, if you read, you will do very well in Dr. Hewitt?s class. I ",1
For online classes he only shares ppt with a voice over. He replies to mails rudely.,0
"Rick is a funny guy, his tests are pretty difficult but if you put in the work to understand the material thoroughly, you will do well. He is pretty strict on attendance and loves talking about BLAW. He makes class enjoyable because he is funny, but I wouldn't take him as a 301 prof.",0
"This man is so uber-pretentious I couldn't handle it at all.  Other people think that he knows what he's talking about, and this is true, but I've always found that he is irresponsibly narrow in his idea of what is ""good design"".  Not everyone is into the Seattle minimalist movement, and if you happen to have different tastes, you're screwed.",0
The University should fire her for the benefit of future students. Not only close minded but also obessive about certain things when it comes to art. Stay away from her classes.,0
Figen is awesome! She's sort of weird but hilarious at the same time. She tells the best stories and keeps class interesting the entire time. I'm not a science person at all and I really enjoyed Oceans. She starts out hard then gets easier. Just stick with her and you will learn so much! She'll buy you pizza and give you take home exams. Best prof!,1
I really loved the class the only thing i disliked is that our final counts for so much of the grade (30%). If you don't do the homework in depth you won't know the material for class. He will know everyones name by the second day and HE WILL CALL ON YOU. Do your homework every nigh because he does walk around and check and does give you a grade.,1
Very difficult to understand him. Long winded explanations that dont clearly answer questions. Never fully completes examples put on the board. Tests are extremely difficult.,0
terrible prof,0
"Professor Seals was one of the best professors I have ever taken because he cares! He wants to see his students do well, and he can cater to multiple learning styles. You can ask him the same question a million times and he will answer until he is confident you understand. Would def recommend!",1
"Maybe he's a good professor for his subject (math), but don't take him for Humanities. He ended up making the class teach itself and treated it as a joke. Sorry, but I don't like to waste my money. I pay for college to LEARN, not to sit back and do nothing while the professor makes lame jokes and tries to recruit you to math club. I give him an F.",0
"Hollis is really hilarious. He keeps his lectures interesting, and he knows what he's talking about. His sense of humor is on point. He is very helpful and he's one of those professors who is adorably excited by his subject. His class isn't easy, but he's awesome!  ",1
"Professor Antonetti is great. He does a phenomenal job of clearly explaining all the material. If you review all your class notes well before the exams, they are easy. The textbook is not necessary at all. Also, if you need extra help you can email him for practice problems that are helpful. His lectures are funny, he always tries to crack a joke. ",1
"Had him for physics and linear algebra. Nice guy, but a terrible teacher. His lectures are just a mess, especially with physics. I ended up having to resort to using the textbooks(which for terrible for both courses btw, but that's another story) and the internet solely to learn and try to understand both courses. Avoid his classes at all costs.",0
"The instructor barely lectures, class time was spent taking up the assignments. Attendance was mandatory and you were not allowed to have your camera off. Tests are super hard even though they are open book.",0
"The professor was alright, I suppose, but I would not take him again. I got a paper back and he marked me down substantially because he disagreed with the conclusions I drew, not with any of my methodology. This is not, in my humble opinion, the mark of a good professor.",1
Best online class ever. He's responds to emails faster than any prof. I've ever had. He gives good feedback if you ask for it. Would totaly take this class with him again.   He also has a mixtape on his website. so.............,1
The homework from the book is confusing as well as the lectures. The labs were insanely difficult and left half the class stumped. The labs also included chemistry which made it even worse. Most times she just goes on about the lecture and half the class will be lost. Grading is harsh and unfortunately I might have to retake this class. ,0
"Professor Hersh is awesome! She always leads a great class discussion, in which you can always give input! There was only two homework assignment and four papers throughout the semester in which I got all A's on. She is very flexible and always willing to help if needed. She is a great teacher i would definitely take her for a WMGS course. ",1
"He's a professor that you need to have like you in order of you to like him, otherwise, he'll grade you even harder than he already does.  His tests can be confusing somethings, but to me, he's a nice guy and I enjoy his classes.  I don't seem to do as well in them as I feel like I should be, but I don't hate going to class. ",1
Chris is a great prof and knows his material inside out. You have to work for your mark in this class because you get what you put in. He genuinely wants you to succeed in his class and is willing to help you if you need the help. Chris is also very clear in what he is looking for when it comes to assignments and exams.,1
Simply put this professor was unprofessional and was outline regarding certain issues. Is extremely unprofessional when it comes to her job.,0
"Great professor for over 2/3 of the semester. Hard class- reading quizzes for each chapter; important chapters had analysis quizzes that were impossible. But if you paid attention, you learned a lot. Participation points are impossible to get. Found out his quizzes were on quizlet and flipped at our class. Lost some respect, but learned so much.",1
"Although funny and sociable, she places too much emphasis on trivial aspects of assignments (i.e. having color pictures in a journal). She also did not actually teach much of the cinematography, on which she placed the most emphasis. However, the course is worth taking.",1
"She's an amazing professor. I defintely learn a lot from her class and improve a lot more better on writing and checking on my grammars thanks to her.  Although, downside is trying to catch up on your essay, drafts and other stuff but in the end it was worth the challenge and money for this class. i defintely had lots of fun in her class. :) ",1
1. He does not understand a thing about what he's teaching;    2. He does not understand your codes either;    3. Constantly asks for help from the student next to him and 'his old friend'--google;    4. Takes points off for no reason he could explain;    5. Read directly from class notes he posts;    6. Can't prepare you ready for anything.,0
"Respect when others are giving their speech. Have your speech ready and just try your best. I was terrified to take this class, but overall it was a great experience. He truly is a great proffesor.",1
"The 6 Observational Events might take you out of your comfort zone, other than that it is pretty easy to get an A. This is a Hybrid class. You meet two times in the beginning of the quarter, and all the resources to complete the assignments are available on Blackboard. Ask him for help. He's always available (via Email) if you need help hit'em up.",1
"Horrible prof Expects students to already know what he is teaching. lecture just gets you more confused than you were before class. if you ask a question he rambles on about how easy it should be and never stops to show you how to do anything. labs are a hard and involve way more office work than actual electronics work. Ferris, GET RID OF THIS GUY",0
There are errors in the syllabus (dates even) yet she will tell you that you can't make silly errors. She gives too many instructions for assignments and the amount of files I have to toggle in between is ridiculous. You must follow all directions if you want to get an A.,0
Best prof! Highly recommend taking this course. Majority of content are in pre-uploaded lectures (very interesting). Attending zoom sessions (once/week) is helpful as he discusses important information re: exams and elaborates on certain concepts. He uploads these sessions too incase you can't make it. Plus he answers questions almost immediately!,1
"Lots of group discussion. Class was always made to be fun. She brings candy and cookies all the time, she's like a mom at school! Absolutely love her",1
He is extremely boring. Does not care to listen about exam review questions. He is stubborn and he makes his exams to difficult for a 103 level class. It is just to easy to sleep in the class,0
"A truly devoted professor and wonderful mentor. He lives and breathes literature, and he really inspires his students to work hard and react personally to the text. Kind, perceptive, and invested in his students. If you want a challenging but fulfilling English experience, take a class with him. It's so sad that he's only here for one more year!",1
This class sucks. don't take it. you will regret it.,0
Amazing lectures rich with information. Especially fun and interesting if you are interested in the subject matter. Andy is exceptionally laid back and also very passionate about rock and roll. Great man and class.,1
I've taken 4 classes in Political Science under Dr Johnson. He's tough as nails but requires you to think and explain. He's not easy and shouldn't be. I'm a conservative and couldn't respect him more for the quality teaching he provides CMU students.,1
Spends half the lecture talking about random things instead of actually teaching. His fill in the blank notes are not very helpful either.,0
"One of the tougher classes Ive taken. She is very disorganized and unclear about assignments. She spends the whole class correcting homework and rushes through lecture. A lot of learning is on your own. Lots of textbook and online homework given, at least 8 hours every week. Although she is nice and funny, it is hard to get an A in her class.",0
"He claims that attendance isn't mandatory but takes attendance every class. He's a very hard grader and is very picky. No partial credit is usually given. His homework and tests are pretty difficult but he does skeleton notes and tells you what he wants you to know, which is helpful. Homework doesn't come from the textbook but he recommends reading",1
"This is not a good class to take to explore political science. While the class is very interesting and you definatley learn a lot, it can be difficult. There is a large amount of reading for this class but lecture helps you understand it. I liked the class even though I'm not a poli sci major. If you're interested and don't mind the work, take it",1
"He is by far the worst teacher I have ever had. He is terrible with English, does not explain topics thoroughly, does not answer your questions, poor POOR organization, becomes distracted easily and cannot get back on topic. I will never take another class that he is teaching. DO NOT TAKE HIM!",0
"I think Professor Burfoot is great. I enjoyed how her topics in sociology were not all theorist and theory, theorist and theory, blah, blah, blah. I enjoyed discussion on random topics involving our society. She is a good lecturer, and very nice to speak to in person.",1
"I took him in the online Thinkwell course, good professor, teaches well. The only issues are his AWFUL jokes and I am not sure he is totally sane. Every once in a while he will laugh about something random and it activates my flight or fight response, just sitting in my room.",1
"I took econ at another school, was failing, and withdrew from the class. With Battista I have 97%. She makes econ really interesting - somehow it is my favorite class. She tells you EVERYTHING you need to know, if you attend class (100% necessary with her), take notes, and do ALL the homework, I don't know why you wouldn't get an A.",1
Her lectures were not helpful for the exams. She gets really frustrated when the class doesn't participate in discussions. There's a pretty extensive presentation and paper due at the end of the semester. Would not recommend.,0
The final assignment milestones sucks so much.,0
"totally unable to understand what he talks about, class would be impossible without the study guide",0
"Mrs. Dalton helped with every question I had, and she even took the time to help me with other classes. She was hands down one of the best professors I've had at Missouri State, and she was really understanding with any circumstance. I only took this class for a Gen ed, but it ended up being one of the best classes I had ever taken.",1
"Paul is a super smart person. Very educated and wise. But, his lectures are brutal. If you dont take extremely diligent notes, youre pretty much destined to fail. Wouldnt recommend as a gen ed class. Thank god wcu is doing the alternative grading option for online classes. I have a 4.0 but his class wouldve brought it way down. Dont take.",0
Great overall and very insightful.,1
I am in this course right now and have really enjoyed it so far.  The tests are pretty easy as long as you study the slides.  I made an A on the last test and did not even read the book.  He gives extra credit points when a lot of people skip class.,1
"Took it online in the summer. Teacher gave so much work I had anxiety attacks over trying to read all of the chapters assigned, write papers, and take a midterm in a short amount of time. Didn't have time to really absorb what I read. Received midterm and paper grades without answers so have no idea what I got wrong.",0
"I took Dr Burke for an online class, Psy300, and she essentially does not teach this class at all. You're on your own to read the textbook and her voluminous lecture notes. The exams are multiple choice but tricky and also badly written (factual errors). On the occasions I emailed her, she was not polite or thoughtful in her answers. Avoid her.",0
"Such a sweet man. Lectures aren't fun, but the topic isn't all that fun. Notes are handwritten so follow along in class and take book notes. Using statistics on the exams will get you an  A. 3 exams w/  5 essay questions in which you get to pick from 10 total. The only other grades are abstract reading summaries & attendance. I'd recommend.",1
"This class is well organized and the syllabus and schedule are very clear. In addition to this, Mr. Waterman sent out reminder emails about upcoming deadlines.  If you read the material, watch the lectures and take the practice  quizzes you'll  do great on your tests.",1
"All info is presented and you have 2 months before things are even due. No interaction until something is graded, and she grades on technicalities, not if you even understand the materials. She comes across really pretentious and condescending. Exam questions are based on YouTube videos. Honestly this class is hard to pass and I have a 4.0.",0
"Gerard is the best professor at BG, in my opinion. Amazing lectures where she relates things to real life situations. She builds relationships with students and that makes it more exciting to come to class.",1
"Don't know why so many guys hype her as a tough prof. She's definitely better than terrible Michelle, who always creates nervous atmosphere during lec&quiz. Debby is a tiny old lady with a huge sense of humor. Hilarious in class, normal questions in quizzes. Never wanna fail you with tricky questions. Just lots of people are intimidated by her cour",1
"Knew what he was talking about and was nice, but the speed of lecture and lack of explanation left you lost. Exams were hard only because you didnt know what was on them. He would provide 5 or so practice problems that would rarely matchup with the 8 problem exam. The only way to study correctly is if you reviewed all the cases.",0
More than half the class had Ds. That means theres something wrong with the way the instructor is teaching!,0
"Worst finance Professor at Salisbury. Class isnt too boring but you will not learn anything. Each test, more than 90% of the class did not finish on time. He says lazy things like how him grading your work makes him deserve teacher of the year. Do Not Take him.",0
"Best Professor I've ever had. Lectures are clear, concise, and fascinating. Brophy demonstrations lots of knowledge and passion in his field. He covers a lot of detail, but hey, that's how you learn! There are a lot of required readings, but most are interesting. He's not a hard grader to boot. Cannot recommend highly enough.",1
"This professor can be summed up in two words: old school. Very few grades? Check. 5 minute classes? Check. Unapproachable? Check. No grades online? Check. I don't have a problem with hard teachers, I have a problem that this professor simply would not help me out when I was struggling with his papers. Only take Nordling if your up for a challenge!",0
she just hands out A's,0
"The sweetest human to ever walk this Earth, and an incredibly talented musician. Not just a Professor, but a mentor. Take any class with Doc Lockeyou wont regret it.",1
"Dr. Madsen was fantastic. If you're in the honors program, take him for Colloquium. His lectures are interesting, he is an easy grader, and he cares about his students. I hear that he is great for Geology as well. Definitely go with Madsen if you can. Easiest A I've earned in college so far.",1
"How does she have ANY positive ratings? I got an A in the class and never struggled but still would NOT recommend her. So rude and condescending, not helpful at all, does random business software in class but never gives instructions and you never get tested on it. Worst professor I've had. She doesn't care about us and I didn't learn a thing.",0
"I took Prof. Mihill for ASCI 490. (Capstone) This class was extremely difficult, however, Prof. Mihill is such an amazing teacher.  He was extremely helpful and patient and replied to my questions within a day, because communication is imperative while taking this class. I can't say enough good things andwould absolutely take this Professor again.",1
"His grading and homework is straight forward, but its gets boring often. ",0
"I took an online foreign policy class. There is a ton of reading and the lectures often repeat some (but not all) information from the readings, so you have to do both or you might miss something. The discussions are ridiculous. 4+ mini essays every week, and I have never struggled to get 100s on short writing assignments this much in my life.",0
Such a great professor. Although she is a tough grader the feedback and revisions she gives is so helpful. There is a lot of homework and work but if you keep up with it youll be fine.,1
"Doesn't grade on content, really only grades on grammar which makes no sense. Would definitely not recommend",0
"This class was and is an great option for anyone who needs a history credit. The readings and videos are informative and easy to keep up with unlike many boring options we could read and watched. The quizzes were very easy for you read the material, I would just make sure you read every question carefully as the wording can be easy to mix up.",1
"If you attend class, you'll be fine. She goes over stuff very clearly and makes it very obvious what you'll be tested on. Tests are easy. A lot of material and reading is covered but she's very good at helping you make sense of it. She's a super sweet lady and appreciates effort. I was not expecting to like this class at all but ended up loving it!",1
Do not take this class! Our Final exam was too long and he sent out an email before the exam saying he knows it is too long and doesn't expect us to finish it in time. Also the exams are very proof heavy. He flips a coin just 10 mins before each exam to decide if he should proctor it. Skip this class if you can.,0
"Great class, pretty fun.  This is not a difficult class, but there is a lot of work.  The work is not hard, it's just the amount of it.  There are 2-3 semester long projects, not including a group project towards the end of the semester that is a 20 minute presentation.  There are canvas discussion posts every night needing 1-2 paragraphs as well.",1
Would never take her class again! Her lectures are so incredibly hard to follow that I literally gave up when the course was about to end. Really hard assignments while all she does in class is give definitions instead of explaining us how to effectively use algorithms or important concepts. Always available to help outside of class hours though.,0
I was super nervous to take his class as I haven't taken a math class in five years. His assigned homework is ALWAYS related to tests and very helpful. He grades very fairly. He is an awesome teacher willing to explain and answer questions. Fast grading. Not to mention he's very nice and cracks a few jokes. He also brought treats several times :),1
Excellent Teacher! Final was overwhelming. Too much expected to learn and know at the last minute.,1
Prof. Buss can be taken as the definition for horribleness.,0
She knows stats in and out and can teach it really well.  She expects you do know it really well too and due to that she can be a very strict and picky grader.  She has an open door policy - stop by and she'll give you all the help you need.  Expect to work really hard and do all the extra credit opportunities because she doesn't curve anything.,1
"Loved his criminology class. He's insane but hilarious and super nice. Tests and Quizzes are easy if you do the reading and go to most classes. If you read and take the practice exams he posts, you can get an A. He usually hints when there's gonna be quizzes. There's only been one time where it was an actual pop quiz. Would definitely recommend.",1
"easy class, he's very knowledgeable about his field but doesn't expect you to be. he speaks to his students as equals and as people. entertaining lectures, he goes on some pretty interesting tangents. just a nice guy and a great prof.",1
Awesome Prof. Very helpful and understanding,1
Easy grader,1
beyond fabulous teacher and easily the nicest professor I have ever had.,1
"My favourite prof of first year. He is so funny and his lectures are a solid pace, plus he posts every lecture before class, as well as his inked versions after class. Homework is an easy 100% every time. Tutorials you show up and get full marks, and he's always there. He seems to be really passionate, textbook free online. Grade is my fault. LOVE",1
"I am in my third year and have loved political science since the start of my post secondary career, but Dr. Hale has killed any love I had for the subject. His is generally a nice man but his work load is ridiculous. His english requirement is enough to kill your grade. The credits are not worth it.  ",0
"What you need to know: - READ THE BOOK: all of her exams only have info from the book, not so much from lecutre - ATTEND CLASS: she takes attendance and will call you out for not showing up - she talks very fast so ask if you can record her lecutres - she lets you do group quizzes and grades assignments easily, but TESTS ARE VERY HARD!!! STUDY!",0
"This professor does not give you a clear understanding of the assignments and she does not take the time to answer students questions, she is just worried about getting though the slides. You will end up figuring out each assignment on your own.",0
"Excellent prof that knows how to maintain lecture interest. You must attend lectures to get the notes you need to study for exams. I did not like how this class had three separate instructors though. It's a terrible approach and completely threw me off. Labs had zero guidance/instruction, although that has very little to do with Dr. Punja.",1
"RUN... FAST! Doesn't teach and expects you to know very advanced materials in a beginners class.  Will not help you, but will instead ridicule you and belittle you ... very condescending!",0
"The amount of reading for this class is inhumane. Do not take this if you have no interest in anthropology or reading. I had to get 11 books just for this class. Can get a B without reading, but some of the material is hard to understand without reading. Lecture slides arent provided, and its presented in a really boring way.",0
Constant lecture.  Does not ask questions.  Exams questions are very specific and its seems like hes trying to trick you.  Nice but not helpful when I stayed after class 3 times.,0
Professor Vaughan is one of the best econ profs at Waterloo. She explains things very clearly and also provides her own notes. She is also very caring and has a wonderful character (but no phones in her class lol). Easy tests and finals and definitely would take her class again!,1
"LisaMarie really cares about her students. She will take the time to call and text each of her students. She was a bit of a tough grader on the paper and the presentations, but the textbook chapter quizzes are really easy points. She is a funny and caring professor, and has a lot of real world experience to share with her students.",1
"He had a joyfulness that radiated across the whole room. I was lucky enough to have the class in person. He is genuinely excited to help kids learn. It is cal II tho, so it won't be easy, but you will have the best support you can ask for. Very responsive on emails and very understanding.",1
"It's a hard class by nature of the material, not the professor. She's a working professional in the field so she definitely knows what she's talking about. Despite her busy schedule, she's always around for extra help if you need it. Tests were hard, but there were always EC options to help. Really sweet person and makes her expectations clear.",1
"Professor N'Jai is a very good professor. He is extremely friendly and approachable. His class is easy for the most part. His assignments are scheduled and predictable, which is a plus. I don't think many people try hard in the discussions so if you actually put in a good effort you will make him happy. Just have an open mind and you'll be fine.",1
"The topics covered are simple,  but she made the tests hard through unfairly harsh grading and time constraints,  and she was pretty unapologetic about it.  The class was unbearably boring  and not worth attending.",0
"If you are new to networking, or old to networking, take this guy, he makes learning a fun. Best instructor ever!",1
"Great person, terrible teacher. SHe taught to the board.. Not the students. I had a 4.0 last quarter in math, and failed this math class. There is no structure and I wouldn't recommend her to anyone.",0
"Although Brian is not very approachable and empathetic for slacking students, he is very passionate about learning and excellence. He has very high standards. Somtimes I found that we connected quite well when other could not with him. I think the reason for that is because I was able to identify my weaknesses and be open-minded to his ideas.",1
"This man should not be allowed to teach anything.  His test were the most arbitray things I have ever experienced.  He assigned a 900 page book and then derived his questions from the footnotes, literally!  His lectures wander aimlessly. To boot, he is obsessed with his own power (which is considerable.  Avoid this professor at all costs.",0
"Very unprofessional woman. Never stopped bragging. If u want 2 learn something productive in her class, just buy the book and teach yourself. Doesn't empathize with the difficulties of her students. And apparently doesn't put in practice the Ph.D. in ""psychology"" she has for she only acknowledges her life, her struggles, her Ph.D and finally, HER!",0
"This class was the biggest waste of my time. She read through the online mindtap textbook every class. Graded assignments are posted a few hours after the class and are due the next day at midnight. She did not know how to answer questions, she would just restate what you asked. If you can, I would suggest choosing a different professor.",0
"You may read the tags and think this class is boring. However, if you're interested in using Excel/Access (huge part of business), take this guy. There is a lot of homework, but each assignment takes about 30 minutes. The lectures are not the most interesting, but you can do a lot with what he teaches. Great teacher & knows his stuff inside and out",1
"Lectures lack organization and structure as shown with numerous breaks. Unprofessional behavior, hostility and contention towards students masked in humor. Fosters a toxic academic environment where students cant openly discuss /share clinical experiences with broader class without fear of reprisal. Lacks enthusiasm and patience for teaching.",0
Dr. Hill is clear about her expectations. The Labs are quite a bit of work so get started early (they are a large part of your grade). She's helpful when you need it. It does take a long time to get grades back on PA and Lab work. I would take another class from her.,1
"He puts on a tough guy act for the first couple of weeks. After that, he's actually pretty funny. Small Group Comm. was a cake walk.",1
"I love this professor.  Although the class can get old because each one we spend discussing articles.  However, it was very interesting and his books are really easy to understand and informative",1
"If you have her, RUN. She is the worst prof I have ever had. Does not teach anything. Relies VERY HEAVILY on the textbook and expects you to memorize all the details. She is extremely hypocritical and a liar. She'll talk about how good of a prof she is and if you come to class then you'll do well and that her tests are easy. ALL LIES.",0
"She's very patient and if she sees that the class doesn't understand what she's talking about, she goes over it in a different way. She's always willing to help in and out of class. She's also a perfectionist so she will point out where you could do better, but she understands that night classes = busy people.",1
"Everyone told me this class would be hard before I took it, but I liked this class. Its not an easy A, but if you do your work and do better then the majority of the class then you can get a B or an A. My biggest advice is to study daily. Otherwise he is very helpful when you need him.",1
"Fairly interesting subject matter, Not very helpful, think's he's funny, even his TA's hate him. Only plus is a big curve at the end of the course",0
"Disorganized; no review for tests unless you continuously plead.  Barely used my lab manual; get ready to do alot of self study because teaching is not his strong suit although he is knows his stuff.  And yes, he yells at students and caused alot of anxiety among students in class.",0
"As other students said previously, Prof. Grant is really rude. The feedback that she DOES give you (when she responds to your emails) is unclear and makes you feel stupid. She showed no compassion or grace towards any of her students even though we're trying to navigate through a pandemic in our early 20s. Now I have to pay to take the class again.",0
she is nuts.the lecture notes wont be posted till midnight or morning of a quiz.No partial points on anything even if you did the entire thing right till the end N theres this single little mistake all are points are knocked off.I understood the material well but her  grading just sucks.N be ready to have more exams n quizzes then more what u learn,0
"Prof. Rasheed is such an amazing lecturer, he is so knowledgeable. He inspired me to pursue the Microbiology field. His test are not difficult,you just have to use logic and be in class. Take lots of notes and ask questions. He is a professor with a good sense of humor, you will enjoy the class. He is one of the best professors i have taken.",1
"This class may have been enjoyable if the professor was organized. AVOID TAKING MUSIC WITH THIS TEACHER AT ALL COSTS. Her marking was unfair, her class was a waste of time. She never followed the syllabus, and would just take items off the syllabus, and add ones at random. TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE.",0
While everyone says he is not the best.... he is! Physics is a hard topic and he goes off topic but I am taking him and he curves the exams and tries to help IF YOU GO AND ASK FOR HELP!!!! his exam is straight from homework or questions he does in class so pay attention. He is not as bad as everyone says just put in the work and try and ask Q's,1
By far the worst class i've taken in college. DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFFESOR! Even if it's your last option!!!!,0
"This professor was great.  He was readily accessible whenever I had questions.  Also, he made topics clear and stressed differences between certain words that might otherwise be confused.  He is a stickler for grammar. He prepares us for quizzes,and gives few assignments.Also, he gives a realistic and applicable view on every topic  he teaches.",1
"Try not to take this class. It can be interesting at times, but it is impossible. 2 hard exams and a 10-12 page research paper. Avoid this class. At all costs.",0
A retired accounting professional who clearly has excitement about teaching others about accounting and the different professions within the field. Straight shooter with great stories. He confirmed my feelings about going back to school to get me accounting degree. Great instructor.,1
"He is obsessed with proofs and understanding matrices and such conceptually and geometrically. Very difficult professor to understand in lectures, but if you were born a genius you will enjoy how he explains the reasoning behind everything. I would recommend taking an easier professor, unless you want a real challenge.",0
"David Creasy seems like a genuinely nice guy, and he's a great lecturer. His course structure leaves something to be desired (peer-graded essay questions and missing information/typos in exams are frequent frustrations), but you WILL learn quite a bit. Just don't expect to come out with a perfect grade.",1
"Never showed up to class on time. Don't expect papers back for a long time. She's a complete mess. Super nice woman, but avoid at all costs.",0
"Prof Misra is eh. He's not the worst but he's not the best either. He has a strong accent so understanding him is difficult. There are 4 test given: 2 in class, 1 open notes, and 1 take home. To be frank, you still need to know everything cause the final is in class. I ended up just teaching myself with the book and reviewed in class with him.",0
Dr. Rosenthal is very nice and shows passion for her subject but she requires us to know a lot about the reading material. We had 1 paper due a week min. 250 words on each story we read. Our discussions in class were boring and time went by slow- it's all lecture. She grades VERY hard and gives you no info on what the midterm or final is.,1
"Professor Leprohon is by far the most caring, genuine, and supportive professor I've ever had. I can honestly say I will never forget him as a prof. He ALWAYS has his student's best interest in mind and constantly provides both academic and emotional reassurance. His exam was a very easy A if you attended lectures and did the readings",1
She is a director and not very knowledgeable about acting and movement. She plays videos from a website and tells students to copy the moves. The vocal warm-ups are also copied from papers. Basically she doesn't have the necessary education and experience. Don't take her classes.,0
Amazing professor.  Definately one of my favorites. if you get teh chance take a class with him.,1
Shes a amazing teacher! Mrs. Smith is very caring. Her name is spelled wrong Dolores,1
"I took her political philosophy class ""The Citizen + the State"".  I'm at Carleton now, studying law + poli sci and a day doesn't go by when something I learned from her class comes up.  It proved to be a very useful foundation.  Sure she is a hard marker but she was very good at providing feedback too, which is more than I can say for some profs.",1
"The teacher is so hard!! She uses the lockdown browser for the online class. If you read the textbook, you'll be fine for the quizzes, but the exams are so hard! This is for forensic psychology. Quizzes every other day and six tests.",0
bad,0
"Mr. Jiao is a great professor, will work with you if you need help. Show up to class, pay attention to lectures and you will most likely pass. He does a good job explaining lectures on power point. Overall a great understanding teacher.",1
"Very good teacher. provided good examples and showed interesting video clips in class. also, very funny. he made me look forward to going to class",1
"Unclear, boring, marks lower than Obimbo's class",0
Dr. Roberts is probably the best STEM professor I've ever taken. Super friendly and easygoing person and she is very straightforward with her grading and lecture material. Take her if you have the chance!,1
He isn't a bad person but he just doesn't make good exams for an exam heavy class. The exams can be very challenging and have nothing to do with class.,1
hated it,0
"After working in the engineering industry for 2 years, I realized Bob is actually a terrible teacher. MATLAB as a program is rarely used in the industry. He never taught or even encouraged you to find info from other sources, which is the most important skill a programmer should have. Consider learning python / vba by yourself. Far more useful!",0
"Dr. Chen is a great man! He's a little hard to understand but he's super lenient about grades. Lectures are boring but he always tells cheesy ""jokes of the day"". He always looks out for the best interest of students. Would take him again 9/10 recommend",1
"He was okay. He didn't use Canvas, so we had to email him all our assignments, which left me feeling uneasy that he wouldn't notice them with the tons of other emails he was surely receiving. We had to write discussion questions for each chapter worth 10% of our grade, but he never gave feedback on them so I wasn't sure if mine were good enough.",1
He was ok. I found him to be interesting. However he gets annoy when people come in late. I did the class in the summer and we only had two test which kinder of make or break. He promised a syllabus which we never received. He is also very sarcastic . Overall I think he is an ok professor but would be my first choice. ,1
"He teaches like we're in middle school. For some, that might be nice, but his tests are way harder than the homework or the material covered in class. He was also very disorganized and he's obsessed with making us work in groups. One of our tests was a group test. I'm a senior and this is the first time I've ever had a group test.",0
"I really enjoyed his class. His lectures are very inspiring and not boring. There are topics of discussions to do each week which I recommend to do early since the answers need to be well written. There are no tests, but there are about one or two group projects to do. There is a final paper of 12 pages which was a bit difficult, but overall great.",1
"So, he basically makes his own notes, the book doesnt help at all, just study everything he gives, all his midterms + finals are multiple choices, final is super tricky, and go to all classes, and tutorials. He tends to integrate a lot (useless things mostly).",0
"If you like programming  take him, assignments are long, his lectures are good but he has an unpleasant attitude. He has no sympathy for students he thinks we're all lazy. Pop quizzes are terrible you either get 0 or 10.  The midterm and final are exactly like the sample given and are exactly like the assignments so you can prepare.",0
"Before coming into the class, I heard horror stories about this prof. However, I am SO grateful to have had Wade. You will learn more than you have learned in any other course. The things you learn can be directly applied! He is tough but you will learn a lot! Work hard and you will get a good grade.",1
She is very unfair i worked my ass off in this class and i got a b- yet another student didnt do a danm thing and hardly ever participated in class got a b- also. i was very upset but what you gonna do. other than that she is a very cool laid back person,0
Don't expect to get your grades back until the finals week.,0
VERY GREAT TEACHER! Extremely smart and hillarious. Makes 8:30's interesting. He picks on people so don't take it personally. Tests are not to bad if you do the reading and go to class.,1
"Not a very good teacher. Constantly says, ""I don't know if this is making sense or not.."" but never actually asks if the students really do get it or whether they need clarification. PSY 100 isn't a hard class but if you have him you probably won't do that great.",0
"Dr.Buell is great. She knows her stuff, and makes you work, and but she's fun!!",1
If you participate there is no way you can get anything less and A. He is passionate about COMMUNICATION.,1
"Wasn't clear with the other instructor on what she wanted in answers. Marks the whole question wrong if you leave out one Sig Fig or don't label something. She isn't easy to talk to, every time I tried to have a conversation with her she put the blame back on me. Wasn't able to do problems the way I was taught in High School without it being wrong.",0
"Great class, and teacher. You would be very lucky to get her",1
"Horrible teacher, the man has delusions of marxism and will insult you at least once if you dont agree with him. For those who said he opens you mind Savellos is 10x better for philosophy.",0
She is nice enough but does not explain things well and talks down to you. This is a hard enough class so the professor should be able to explain things clearly so that everyone can understand and has a chance to do well.,0
"She cares whether we learn or not, which is good. She makes us put in a bit more effort in lab, but afterwards I leave knowing what the lab was actually about.",1
I loved the material but not the professor! She was unavailable and literally late to class every single day. The worst part was that she also let us out late every day. She never responded to students emails and very unavailable for office hours. She also constantly forgot what she had assigned. The material itself? Amazing! Totally recommended.,0
David is the my favorite professor at the university. If you study the slides he gives you for the test there is no reason you shouldn't get an A. He also does a good job of taking interest in every student and  giving his advice of how to build a better resume and grow professionally.,1
"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. This is way too hard to be a gen ed. The way he speaks to people is disrespectful, and he thinks he's better than everyone else. He doesn't use canvas or any other online grading system, so you don't know your grade until the end. A majority of your grade is the midterm and final, and they are both extremely difficult.",0
"Every human being needs to take this class, Brown is very passionate about leaving the world a better place.",1
Material was taught with clarity which make learning fun. Great professor.,1
"Terrible teacher. She doesnt really teach anything at all during class. I have a disability and she spoke over my head and assumed my needs a lot. Very disrespectful. I walked out mid-class in October and I havent looked back since. If you get her for any class, I recommend switching sections ASAP.",0
I've had Dr.Case for a ton of classes and have always learned a ton from him,1
Professor Calkins is an amazing ENC professor. Wanted to take her for 1102 but couldn't get a spot unfortunately. She really cares about her students growth as writers and really helps you when you have questions about your papers. If you care about your grade she will make sure you get the best grade possible.,1
"She's the only teacher for the class at LSC Mont. So if you can go to another campus do so, don't take it from her. Very disorganised and rarely helpful. The final was the most work I'd done in the class and they hardest thing.",0
"Uncle Bob is the man. If you're an accounting major, definitely take his class because you will come out so much more prepared than the other 207 classes. You need to follow his course guidelines if you want to do well, so be sure to take them seriously. He's also hilarious in class which makes learning accounting so much better. Highly recommend",1
"I took this class because it said it would be a GPA raiser however after taking the first test which had questions about things we didnt even learn and she sent out the wrong marks to the wrong people i realized that was not the case. She is a terrible teacher, I stopped going to her classes since what she says is straight from the slides she sends",0
"Dr. Sienerth is awesome and made Chemistry bearable for me two semesters in a row. SUPER accessible outside of class in office hours and just in general, and always willing to help you work through a tough problem even if it takes a while. I pretty much bombarded him with emails multiple times a week and he was always helpful and nice! Take him!",1
"Sougstad is my favorite professor in Carlson's MIS department for many reasons. He WILL help you become a better writer and rewards creativity. Sougstad is genuinely passionate about IT Strategy, which is the premise of 420W-- you now need to put on your CIO thinking cap on. He has a bad rep teaching 3202, because he is a high-level thinker!",1
"He is very personable, and easy-going! He is a great philosophy prof who is clearly passionate about the subject. This class has taught me a lot, and he really tries to get the message across through repetitive lecturing which is very good for this course. No powerpoints, just pure lecturing (this is how University should be like)!",1
"He is very smart, nice, and helpful.",1
Did not like the man,0
Prof. Baker knows what he's doing. He always writes the notes on the board so make sure you have plenty of paper. He gives extra credit opportunities and most worksheets are credit/no credit. He can be pretty funny but he's definitely old-school. Nothing online. If you need to reach him you have to CALL his house lol,1
"This is the hardest class I have taken at Grand Valley. You have to work extremely hard not to fail. He is a very nice man and if you go to his office hours he is very willing to help, but his tests and quizzes are so difficult it seems impossible to get an A in the class. Even my accounting tutor was having difficulty helping with his problems.",0
Best teacher I ever had at ECC! He is very knowledgable and easy to learn from. He is always willing to help. Take his class and you will not regret it!!!!! A++++++ rating!,1
"Disagree with the last post. She has VERY high expectations and is a tough grader, but I think she is consistent. You'll learn a ton in this class. Lots of role plays. Readings usually not essential. Would take another class with her.",1
"The lectures are amazing, but that's all I can say about his teaching. The lectures go over all the easy stuff, with little to no math involved, and the tests are really hard. I don't know how you can teach this way. If you take the test based on how he presents lectures, you will FAIL badly. Cool guy, bad teacher.",0
"I highly recommend taking Ms. Jackson's class. This class was live online but half online. Instructions are clear , with about 3 assignments due a week. Group discussions were fun, quizzes on each Chapter but its open book. I learned a lot in class and I hope to take her other classes in the future. An A grade is there if you want it.",1
"I took math 115 in the summer with him and let me tell you, he should NOT be teaching.  He may be a good tutor but he is NOT A GOOD TEACHER.  He does expect you to just know the stuff and he doesn't teach anything.  I ended up having to drop the class and waste the $400 I paid for it... Not a happy camper!",0
"This class was a nightmare. I am a 90+ student, but I struggled to get above 70. He throws in unpredictable twists on his exam questions that have not been covered in class. His examples on the board were always riddled with mistakes and made understanding the content very challenging. Definitely go to office hours and do all practice exams.",0
Never take! I ended up withdrawing from her class because of her grading. I received all 0's on major assignments for small errors like a spelling mistake. Absolutely horrible,0
"I personally took this class to learn about information technology within the hospitality industry. I have learned a lot about cruises, as well as study abroad, and medical tourism. I wish I could learn more about technology. ",1
"Nice guy but he couldnt care less how you do in his class. His lectures are monotone and if you lose focus for a second youll be lost. The class is graded on 4 exams. He posts the slides on sakai and there is ONE practice exam for each exam. Other than that youre on your own, no hw to study from, only the book and slides you have to teach yourself",0
"This guy is probably a good engineering and knows what he is talking about. However his English comprehension SUCKS! He cannot communicate clearly with the class, mumbles his words, mis-spells on the board, and when a question is asked he doesn't really understand what is being asked. Although he is a nice guy, he isn't a good teacher period. ",0
There is no document of civilization that is not at the same time a document of barbarism.,1
Thanks Tim for a great semester!,1
Drop the class if you have S. Kern. Ask him for help and he told me he could not help me.,0
I loved this class. I thought it'd be a boring class but Mr. Becker made it interesting. He really knows History. He explains it perfectly WELL and CLEARLY! As long as you do the work on time and participate you got an A. He's very calm & polite. He cares that everyone learns & shows the same respect to everyone. Highly recommend him!,1
"Dr. Harvath was great! This subject is not very easy, but he is an intelligent man and does a great job explaining it. Quizzes every other week or so, he drops your 2 lowest grades. Homework is extra credit. 3 unit tests. He goes over last semesters unit test as review and makes your test almost identical. Attendance not mandatory but it helps",1
"Ive taken a lot of college and english courses in my career as a student and its VERY safe to say that Professor Wardens Comp 1010 course was the highlight of suffering, anger, and rage. Her grading is nothing short of rage inducing. You can do the exact work she wants and shell still make up something about how you didnt do as you were told",0
This guy is one of the most arrogant and falsely opinionated person I've ever met. Mocks students in the most dim-witted ways. Can't believe I'm paying to witness his incredibly loose grasp on the art he is teaching - which is exemplified in his own work. Intellectual light-weight holding absolute no ability in teaching a University level class.,0
"He is a super awesome person! Truly cares for his students and wants to get to know them! Yes, his class can be very boring and dull, and most is common sense, but he's a sweetheart! Super easy test, all MC. Very straightforward, tests come from his powerpoints which he posts online. Has an awesome attendance policy- you'll see.",1
"Took the honors version. He ALWAYS had technical issues that took time out of lectures, and kept us later to make up for them. He made a lot of mistakes while working on problems. His tests were incredibly long and were close to impossible to complete. Curve was good. Every professor I have had after him has been a SIGNIFICANT improvement.",0
"The best professor I had during my undergrad.  I think I took every class that she taught, including two different courses on Aristotle.  Even that she made fascinating!  Teaches you to be a clear, clean, concise writer and to structure your ideas well.  Her classes are well-organized, interesting and definitely worth the work. Highly recommended!",1
"Incredibly nice teacher with little surprises on exams.  Only questioned on topics that were discussed in class.  Study hard for exams and you'll be fine.  Super concerned with helping her students and it shows.  Lectures get boring, but still super nice and a good teacher.",1
"I had no interest in this topic really at all, however Sbragia is a really good lecturer and pretty funny so it made the 2 hour lectures bearable. The class itself isnt too bad, 2 papers, 2 tests. I didnt really do any of the readings, just went to most lectures, and studied a lot using the study guide, overall decent class and great professor ",1
"Lectures are read from notes which come out of the textbook. Tests are basically straight out of the book and are easy if you study, but if you don't study they are difficult.",1
I don't know why there aren't more reviews about Holly but she's great! She's super funny and a tough grader. She likes to throw you into the deep end and see how you do and is sometimes ambiguous about what she wants unless you specifically ask her. The idea is to make the most out of her class by participating. She will help if you ask her.,1
"Bad instructor, way to fast. I want to say something nice about her as an instructor. but I can't. she is nice as a person though! DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!",0
Super nice proff,1
"He will quickly scribble a list of ""how-to"" instructions and while your trying to catch up on writing he just explained 3 other things you have no chance of understanding anymore. He doesn't allow the student time to absorb. You may only see one example per topic. If you heard it one time and took your notes thats good enough for him. Sink or swim.",0
LONG exams! 150+ question exams. Yes he gives you the review a week before but the review itself is 200+ questions that you need to find the answers to and remember them. Unrealistic. Don't bother complaining he won't listen/care. Attendance is mandatory. You lose points for not coming to class. Jams 5 chapters in one test because he's unorganized.,0
Tells students a story about how someone she went to business school with got out in the working world and ended up committing suicide. Great inspiration for us thriving young business students....What is her problem??,0
"One of the best professors at the school. Enthusiastic, knowledgeable and a great lecturer.",1
"Dont take her EVER for anything. She is mean, unhelpful, and rude. Very disorganized and the most unreasonable person Ive ever had to interact with in my academic career. This lady should be fired.",0
"Not the best, but okay. She moves fast through the content, but you can slow her down by asking questions, and she'll do her best to help you understand. It's half concept/applied so not too bad, and she gives study guides. Attendance counts as a grade & you should probably go or you'll be lost anyway. Stats just sucks tbh not the teacher's fault.",1
It was fun. Now I can speak Russian. The trip to NY was amazing!,1
First few days of class you may think he is so confusing. But you must write everything he writes on the board on engineering paper and use ruller to wtite clean and dont confuse yourself. Then go home and study them. Exams are base on what he is doing in class. No HW. He is not like other professors that waste time on theory.,1
I didn't understand anything in this course from his lectures.  Albeit he's a really really nice guy...the teacher leaves a bit to be desired.  I'm just happy I passed and got my credits.  It's as if I never took this class...it feels weird...,0
it was a good class really,1
"Loved this class. The material is great by default, but it's made better when this engaging prof teaches it. There was a group project (short film) that put some logistical strains on students, but he was expecting participation and attempts at film technique, not masterpieces, thus making it easy. Papers/reviews were simple. Highly Recommended",1
Talks to you like a child because she works with kids. The exams are easy if you know what the studies were about but the multiple choice were oddly specific. She grades papers kind of hard.,1
"Worst Math Professor I've met! Heard it's her first time teaching Linear Algebra, big mess. It's true she makes quite some effort in teaching, but it is worthless except for the class examples she gives. Her arrogance and dogmatic style of teaching make few understand; in the name of ""your benefit"", she never posts quiz and HW solutions!",0
"Dr. Shively is such a knowledgeable professor. She is experienced in her field so she knows what she's talking about. Lecture will either be very interesting or very boring, depends on the topic. 3 exams make up 75% of the grade and a collection of small assignments make up 25%. Shows videos in class and gives extra credit. I'd take her again.",1
"I enjoyed the class and the material, I learned a lot but I worked really hard and didn't do as well as would have liked. The reason is the tests are ridiculously hard, asks very obscure questions, and there is a huge amount of material to study with little direction. Also she said she would curve up the grades for the mid-term but she didn't.",0
"I really liked Steve personality wise, funny dude, pretty easy to get along with, total nerd, definitely likable. As far as the math goes, it was college level algebra, which is not a basic class, but it's not a really hard class, and I feel its a bit beneath him to teach it, so he teaches it that way and its not always easy to follow for some.",1
very last minute  vague rushes into things confusing at times during lecture,0
"I don't recommend taking her online course. There was quite a bit of reading, but that is to be expected. Ridiculous time limits on exams/quizzes, NO feedback, and turn around time for grades (semester is over and I still haven't received grades for 2 papers- be prepared to wait 8-10 weeks). DON'T. DO. IT.",0
"Dnt take him. He is old and cranky. Quiz Evey day , test are easy 150 multiple choice but still he is  mean. ",0
"Darcher went above and beyond with his teaching. The best professor I've ever had. If I could, I would take all his classes just to improve my writing. Has the BEST feedback, constantly initiating growth and providing opportunities for students. He saw my writing potential and helped me learn how to write better and self-correct my literature",1
"This was a remote class that was taught solely off pre-recorded lectures. Professor Orozco was not accessible out of class and doesn't email back. 3 discussion boards, weekly readings and videos to watch. Textbook is awful and he tests you on the authors opinions of philosophers which makes 0 sense. Our class met on zoom only twice...",0
"Sometimes she gets caught up in her own jargon, but she really does want her students to succeed (as evidenced by all the As she gives).",1
"I got a perfect 100% in CS 10! Dobeck is amazing at what he does. Not only did he pick a good textbook that explained everything, he walks through things in his video lectures. Sometimes he makes jokes then and there on them so thats awesome. I absolutely recommend going with this professor if you need to take Intro to Computers. 6/5 stars.",1
"NEVER skip class.  NEVER talk in class.  NEVER smile in class.  ALWAYS pay attention in class.  Do all your homework, even if it is Spring Break.  Then, maybe then, you will get your C- and get out of there.  Oh, yeah, you better be able to take notes, because there will be plenty of them.  If you are not required to take this class, then DON'T!!!!",0
"Be careful. He is very smart and expects everyone to rise to his level instead of coming down to earth for us normal folk. He grades harshly and isn't always clear when he explains his expectations, even though he thinks he is. He takes some getting used to, but if you communicate with him regularly and build a relationship, he softens up.",1
Don't bother taking this class unless you're going into Law. Exams are 50 true false questions on court case holdings which is pretty much all luck. Guy is hilarious but goes off on rants that confuse whats important and whats not. Assigned 7 chapters for the final which consists of at least 100 court cases to memorize. Good luck,0
"There's a quiz every Wednesday. As long as you readtake notes on the chapter, you should get at least 810. She's really not as awful as everyone makes her out to be. A nice and humorous woman and tries to help you understand. Come to her if you have questions.",1
An overall terrible course. Not necisarily her fault but showed very little enthusiasm. Very boring and not very applicable to teaching math.,1
"Worst Experience at TCU yet. Reading and Quizzes every night and she takes forever to grade anything, so you won't know that you're failing the class until it's too late. But really my problem is that she is incredibly biased. She teaches opinion as if its fact and expects everyone to agree with her and then tests you on her opinions. DO NOT TAKE!!",0
She is honestly a great professor and you should get an A as long as you listen in class and take notes. Tests are all based off a list of key terms and she makes sure to go over every one on the list. Attendance isn't mandatory unless it's Friday (still go to class). 2 tests and they are easy. 5/10 250 word discussion prompts due and they are easy,1
Extremely difficult grader and not often clear about instructions for papers. You have to read all of the books assigned as there will be random quizzes on them. Stay on his good side and you should be okay but i would not take him again.,0
A+ I Dnt knoe wht idiot rated this guy a 3. This is the easiest class i have every took. Test are straight foward and EASY. I never met a teacher that wants the class to learn. just come to class and he will make u understand what hes saying  in the simplest way. He does alot of practice in the board so that means tht you will be read for the test.,1
"She is amazing! I took every class possible I could with her. Makes Jokes, and tests are easy. You would love this teacher. I recommend her to anyone!",1
"How this woman teaches is beyond me. Knows the material but is completely useless attempting to convey the knowledge to students. Reads off slides (info directly from book; created by TA) entire class. Takes attendance. Homework is meaningless so long as you make an attempt as she doesn't check it. Do the HW, know review sheet, get a good grade.",0
"Very kind man who truly wants his students to do well; unfortunately, he is not very articulate and can be easily misunderstood. He is a good man, not a good teacher.",0
"All tests in the class make up the grade. He will not curve the tests so study hard. Also, he has no idea how to teach and makes the material harder than it needs to be. My advice would be to get tutoring and try to teach the material to yourself.",0
"He's a nice guy. Seems like he has seen his fair share of the world. Rambles a lot about random things, like pink armadillos and manatees mating.  Good professor? Not really. Easy A. Bring something to do. Will go over time every class period and will not care.",0
"Peggy is a truly remarkable teacher.  She stands out amongst the many lacklustre professors out there.  She cares about her students, and clearly loves what she is doing.  I luckily got to take two classes with her, both Human Sexuality classes, and they were some of the best courses I have taken in University. Should be mandatory for everyone!",1
"Had a few of Marty's classes between 98 and 03.  He expects quality work, but Is fair. Easily one of the best teachers I've ever had. Marty knows his**** and delivers it in an engaging (usually humorous) way. Take his classes if you have a chance... Especially ""Culture and the Haulocaust"" if they still offer that.",1
"Moody Professor, Grades how she desires. Be prepared not to get grade results for weeks. Easy subject made hard!? Doesn't respond to emails, no grade checks ever! ",0
Very sweet ! Brought food every class and not that much work only did 3 essays and I passed !,1
"Easily the best professor I've had so far. He's extremely understanding of students having lives outside of his class and school, has an incredible talent for remembering student names, and he's great at splitting up lengthy lectures to keep us engaged. I'm going to try to take as many of my INFO classes by him as I can if I get into the major.",1
"I'm surprised at how many unkind reviews there are here.  Leung can be hard to understand and he does move quickly, but communicates well with examples.  He is funny and more than willing to help, if one is willing to ask.  He does have very high standards  and always seems disappointed when they are not met.  All in all a decent professor.",1
"Probably the worst Professor I have ever had. Absolutely ridiculous grader, and too stuck up for his own good. Do not take him.",0
awesome professor!,1
"Eh, it's an easy class--you might not get a lot out of lectures, sure, but phys II is still pretty easy, so you can get it on your own.  EE's might find this interesting as well: Folk taught Holzinger, and Holzinger taught Haller...quite an academic lineage, as it were...",1
One of the rudest people i have ever met.  Everyone tells me she's nice and helpful but she is incredibly nasty to me and won't help.  If you aren't a liberal i wouldn't take a class with her.,0
"Borg is boring and impossible. No matter how any times you read the text book the essay portions of her test will kill you, while study guides may touch base on multiple choice, it will NEVER help with essays. All her lectures are reading monotone from a power point that is posted online for you to read at home. If at all possible avoid.",0
"Writing this in case the problems around Katz fade from student memory in the coming years. Before taking a class, be aware that Katz does publicly hold controversial opinions about diversity, women in STEM, and homosexuality,that many students and other members of the department have condemned (see: his website or StudLife Archives)",0
"If don't have someone you can share notes with, don't skip class. Tests are mostly true/false and they are very long. Didn't really learn anything, he reads pointless articles throughout class and tests you on it. If it wasn't for a shared google doc that was made for everyone in class to share notes in for the tests, I probably would've failed.",0
"he will put you to sleep but you cannot skip because he gives up to 10 points daily on a little paragraph you write at end of class. overall not to hard and I even slept like everyday and still got my points. 2 essays out of class, also not too bad",0
Great teacher. Makes the class really fun and interesting to listen to. He grades very fairly for writing pieces. Not super strict in grading but you do have to put effort into the work. Also gives good feedback for the essays and such. Lots of reading overall but it's manageable if you keep up.,1
"She grades more on English than the content of the class. You write a paper including all of the information needed but she doesn't like your delivery you get a D automatically. She doesn't care if you have other classes, she gave 2 papers in a week, one over a move the other over a book. Her discussion board posts requirements are also ridiculous.",0
"This guy is a joke of a teacher. He is so full of himself. He may be a good judoka, but hes such a bad teacher. Will make fun of you if you answer wrong, ask questions which he consider are stupid, or perform a move wrong. Really unhelpful. Need help? You better ask his TAs instead. Doesn't really teach. Just show u the moves & tell you to do it.",0
"Very understanding during the pandemic. Homework due once a week but towards the end, it was harder concepts but it was perfect and aligned with the tests super well. It's hard to keep up with lectures sometimes so make sure you are prepared. This class taught me so much and he is very generous with extra credit. Overall a solid and humble prof.",1
The lectures are fantastic. I really enjoy listening; he makes the lectures very interesting.,1
"Mr. Prunty gives help whenever it is needed, you just have to ask. He will work with you on a problem until you are able to do it on your own. I won't say he's hilarious, but he can be funny and he likes to joke around. He does not tolerate foul behavior or language- he respects you and he expects the same back. It's understandable.",1
",He's a massmurder and DSP is his chainsaw ""youknowimean""!! Teaches good but very tuff in his exams !",1
Took her 6 week course online & do not recommend for business majors. A lot of work and sometimes would test you on things that werent explain on lectures! Lectures are also long & often gives unnecessary assignments that pile on hw. She does put a lot of time and effort into her lectures but would only recommend this class if you are a Econ major,1
I'm currently in this class and it was a big mistake. Teacher goes off topic the whole time. At first its funny but it gets uncomfortable. Have no idea how the exam is going to go and i find learning in this class is difficult to grasp because there is not much emphasis on it. Please do not take this class. Learn elsewhere.,0
Nice guy and very vocal lecturer. Covers lots of interesting topics and good at explaining the issues for each case study. Midterm is easy if you attend class and have a general knowledge of past ethical issues seen in the news. Honestly one of the best profs for ethics you can get.,1
"Very lecture heavy class. The specifics of what you are supposed to be doing can get really confusing as he tends to change his mind on what he wants for assignments. Don't try to follow the class through the syllabus as he adds, deletes, and changes assignments often. He does tell very interesting stories and has a lot of experience in the field.",1
This was the hardest course I have ever taken. He gives quizzes almost every day and you only have 14 minutes to answer 25 questions. No matter how many times I read the textbook I always did terrible. The papers are grader very hard because he cares more about the font then describing the task. Never take this professor!!,0
"Professor Esposito is PHENOMENAL!!! He is extremely passionate about what he teaches, and I adore his ""pathos"" during lectures. Everyone who gave him a low rating probably didn't put in the effort to do well in the class. He is the best and I would take him again 100 times if I could. Loved this class!",1
"Doesn't give good feedback, doesn't grade papers or answer emails, never is in office on his office hours, he grades hard and gives confusing criticism",0
"excellent tutorial leader, and really knows what she's talking about. she expects a fairly high level from her students, but she's quite helpful and actually very fun to be around. this was the most enjoyable tutorial i've had.",1
She doesn't care about this course.,0
He cares about his students and is helpful in every sense.,1
terrible dont go to class the test is so easy and you dont use your lecture notes.,0
"It may not seem like it at first, but Professor Hewitt is a great prof who really knows the material. She is passionate about it, and wants her students to understand. There aren't any tests or quizzes, but there are four papers. They seem intimidating at first, but she's not a super hard grader; just make sure to double check your grammar.",1
"Do NOT take Milligan. Her lectures are super boring with no clear examples or visuals. Her midterms are extremely difficult and she does not curve any of the tests. By far the worse professor i have ever had. Also, makes you read a ton of unnecessary articles. ",0
"You can tell Sam is a very smart man, and he genuinely enjoys what he teaches. However lectures are very unstructured and don't follow any slides. You have to pay close attention to catch what's important. If you get a good GSI (which i did not) your discussion section will help you acheive the grade you want. You HAVE to go to lecture to do well.",1
"Anne is one of the nicest, most helpful professors you can take. That being said, do not choose to take her if you want to learn a lot. For certain courses (e.g. Project Management) she is great. For other things, like learning database fundamentals, you should avoid her.",1
"He was a real piece of garbage. I was in school for 20 years and he was the worst teacher I've ever had. If you need help, he is just so rude. Even if you get help, he is mean and grumpy. I'm sorry to all those in his class. Remember, everyone in the class is going through the same thing.",0
"Schleiny is a really fun guy.  He makes lame jokes, but they're so lame they're funny.  He was a fair grader.  Do your homework (including the suggested problems) before the exam and you should be fine.  The labs are not that bad.  They really help you to understand Matlab which you'll need for later courses.",1
"Worst professor I have ever had. He's a nice guy, however his teaching methods are the worst I have ever experienced in any school I've ever been in. Literally anyone else on the planet could've presented this material to me in a less confusing way. Tests and quizzes are comprised of surprise material that is not on study guides. ",0
"If you're taking this class for a theme... DON'T! I found this class excruciatingly boring. I hated going. She's a nice enough lady... but rambles on and on, doesn't encourage class discussion, and doesn't make any topic interesting (even though a lot had the potential). I would not ever take her again, or recommend her.",0
"This professor needs to retire ASAP. Her lectures are boring and dreadful. Ridiculous amount of reading and she doesnt even go over the paper about a book that is not relevant to the class material. If you are really into politics you might find her rants quite interesting, otherwise try a different professor.",0
"Gets off topic too much, rarely discusses the book, no test review. Hard to pass when we do zero book discussion and watch videos. Cool person but not a quality teacher",0
His resources for success are not helpful and are outdated. Way too many things to navigate throughout the website. Feedback from work arent helpful. Prof responds emails in a long time. The online meetings have nothing to do with what were learning. The criteria and rubrics he left for us to work on for assignments are not resourceful or helpful,0
"Dennis is the absolute best. Straightforward class, well-divided between lecture and interactive examples. He embodies ""chill:"" never seen him not calm, cool, and helpful, and he turns mistakes into constructive lessons. This man loves Organic Chem, but understands that you don't. Never condescending. I wouldn't doubt that he can fly either.",1
"If Professor Mason doesn't like your writing style you won't get an A no matter how hard you try. He expects a lot and is rarely available outside of office hours. His tangents do end up on the tests though, so take extensive notes. I've had him twice and I will do anything not to take him again.",0
"One of the worst professors I have had. He is a respected professor but he just shares his views and finds a ""philosophical"" way to invalidate those who do not agree with him. Grading criteria is unclear, and he makes you read A LOT. He has made some gross and questionable comments in class. Overall, would NEVER take a course with him again.",0
Dr. Zambrano made me realize how much I loved Spanish and showed me all the possibilities there were with taking the class. Take Zambrano if you can! He will help you whenever you are struggling but also make you learn it!,1
"Horrible professor. Refuses to regrade papers even though students have answered questions correctly, and takes way too long to regrade them so that a student can't ask another professor to regrade if they go to him first. Could've gotten 15 pts back on a test.",0
Worst professor I have ever had. Miss a class lose a point on your final average. Only have 15 minutes to do a 25 question quiz every week. Over half the class dropped after the drop date. One test class average was a 25.26 ( there were close to 200 students in that class),0
He's useless and grades unnecessarily hard. He's boring and needs to. Retire because he's not doing this school any good. I would feel bad about being harsh  but he clearly doesn't feel bad about being harsh with his grading.,0
"Great teacher with very clear guidelines from day one.  She is sometimes difficult to understand, as her Korean accent is thick at times.  However, her tests are fairly straightforward if you read and UNDERSTAND the slides she posts.  Doing the optional problems she posts from the textbook help and attendance is optional but essential to passing.",1
"AVOID. JUST AVOID. Take him though if you're better at learning yourself than through him. He teaches everything through PowerPoint, giving very common classroom examples, but the homework and testing were often difficult. Often, he makes you work through his lectures given on slides. Homework Online and PHYSICAL work is expected to be submitted.",0
"Dr. Osberg is the best professor that I have ever taken class with. You have to work and cannot skip class because you take a lot of notes each class. However, you learn a lot and if you work hard, you will succeed and be happy. Dr. Osberg is so knowledgeable about psychology and also very helpful. Don't be afraid to meet with him at his office.",1
Great teacher who is there to help you find your way. 102 can be a tough course - don't expect to get an easy A. But Melissa makes it very straightforward to succeed. If you're in the Honors section be prepared for an extra project.,1
she is tough and not clear. writing exercise is confusing,0
"You take 4 tests and that is basically your entire grade, the tests are all based off of the book, and a lot of the questions are difficult to understand. To see what you got wrong you have to go to his office hours which are before 8:00 Am and you only get 15 minutes...",0
Worst Professor I've ever had. Makes you feel bad when you ask a question. Is very hard to follow. Homework assignments take hours and test are very difficult. Do not take him if you don't have to!,0
He is a good professor but a strict grader. i would try to avoid this class because it is a hard 102 class.,0
"I will be very honest with my ratings. This prof. is very discriminatory when he grades. To get A grade, you need to take all of Comp Sc classes with him from CSC200. His behaviour is rude to new students. He discusses and forces his students to solve his personal issues. He will keep talk against other professors tha he is the best.",0
"He is a really passionate and experienced professor. If you attend the lectures and are interested in the subject matter you will do pretty well. If you follow his advice and write briefs for all the cases he gives you, you should do really well on the exams.",1
"Very nice woman.Extremely helpful, class isn't hard at all, and if you're lucky you'll even have a tutor in your class always available.I'm a math person, so it's a bit easier for me, but honestly not hard.Go to class, pay attention, and you'll do perfectly fine. DEFINITELY RECOMMEND HER",1
"Nice professor, but his work is strenuous. Don't expect to get higher than a ""D"" on his 15-page papers unless you're graduating-- in that case you get a ""C!"" Do ALL of your journals! His grading is TOUGH! He only gives essay tests. Watch out!",1
"I really looked forward to class. He's very clear about what he wants, he has study questions and he's clear about what to study. He's so enthusiastic its contagious and so funny! He's really nice and fair. He's an expert in interest groups and that's the course. He's my favorite professor definitely take him if you can.",1
"SO HOT. He is a fine looking specimen as well as the most helpful prof I've ever had. Relatable, personable and encouraging. He made me want to change my major. Always available to help and is easy to contact. Makes an effort for the class to get to know him as well as each other. Class participation is a must but he makes it a lot of fun.",1
She makes the class very fun and interesting.,1
"Be very wary.  I would never encourage anyone to study privately with Terry.  Ther are much, much better trumpet teachers in Boston.  His information is limited.  He is not the kind of ""all-inclusive"" teacher that should hold a position at a major university.",0
Such a sweetheart!! Super approachable and good in lecture. I studied for maybe 1 hour for each exam.,1
"I took the class in person using the ALEKS program. Attendance was a large portion of your grade despite ALEKS being all online. She was also almost always late, and did not teach just answered questions. Nice enough lady, a little awkward but didnt teach much.",0
speaks at a very lowtone sometimes it is hard to hear,1
"Hitay is HILARIOUS! She expects you to understand the concepts right away, then apply that knowledge to questions far from the examples she gives. The tests were open book but the questions she gave required logic and reasoning, so having the textbook there wasn't even needed. She's scary at first but she is very clear and makes ling interesting!",1
A good prof whose lectures and required readings were interesting!,1
Excellent class. I would recommend it highly. Very thought provoking and the professor made it very interesting.,1
"His philosophy for teaching a class is that he shouldn't cover all the material. Instead the students should read the textbook and teach themselves everything. He uses class to answer any questions but spends more time on unrelated tangents. On the first test of the semester, he only covered about 20% of what was tested. He's slow to grade anything",0
Wible is a good professor in the way that he teaches and lectures well; I thought his lectures in class were easy to follow. He wants to engage students in his lectures so be ready for him to ask questions. He is however a very tough grader. You have 3 papers and a final term paper that has to be seven pages.,0
"I'ma be real clear. Her class is SUPER easy! As long as you show up to class and pay attention to her lectures, you're gonna pass. Read the book and it will make the class a breeze, and the book is actually interesting. All these people bad-mouthing Ms. Thompson are just slackers. I honestly didn't really try my best in this class and got an A+!",1
"Unclear, unhelpful and incapable of giving a coherent lecture. It's never a good sign when you feel you've effectively learned nothing in an entire course. He effectively left us going into our final blind.",0
"great topic, great information...boring teacher",0
"Unclear, but you can corner him and envoke a lie and catch him with it. Likes costco, anything google gets him to bust a nut. If you want an A you'll need to go over the top on all assignments and make him feel warn and fuzzy with terminology. Giggity.",0
"Dr. Foxall is a kind, respectful, considerate woman. She truly cares about her students and their wellbeing. She is very understanding when it comes to granting extensions. All of the negative comments on here are from salty first-year students who barely studied for the midterms. Just spend some time studying and you will do well in her class.",1
dont bother to look at her slides. read the book,0
"One of the worst professors/teachers I've ever had. Sarcastic, rude, and condescending. Tough grader but also takes a long time to post grades so it's hard to know how well you're doing. Do not take her class unless you have to.",0
"I really loved it. Every class was interesting and I was excited for all of them. She fills the class with personality and a vibrancy unparalleled by any other professor I have ever had. This was my favorite class. I learned tons, wrote some decent stuff, and made great friend. I recommend anything she teaches to any sort of student. 10/10",1
"Great teacher, she reviews the day before the tests. Also allows cheat sheets. She makes this class very easy. Please take her.",1
great prof! super nice and caring,1
Definetley wants to see his students pass. This class requires a massive amount of effort and attendance is therefore mandatory. Test are by no means easy but he is willing to do retakes. Super nice guy but the class is crazy tough. I had to drop about halfway through the semester. Take this class if you want to challenge yourself. Not for the lazy,1
Kevin Lamb is lame!,0
"Great course! There were many assignments, but if you do them, you will easily get points. The midterm wasn't too bad, but the final was much harder. But overall, it is not hard to get at least B+. MÃ©lanie was really passionate and encourage class participation. Overall, I would recommend!",1
"Impossible class unless you are up to doing calculus proofs, but he is a good professor and does care.",1
This teacher is AMAZING!!so many neat stories its like he was born to be a chem teacher. Dressed as the grim reaper for finals. That just describes his funny and laid back mood. He will always help in lab if you don't understand something. Class fills up fast so hurry to get him! I recommend taking his class and lab together!!,1
"This semester's class was really non-traditional. Video lectures w/ scripts, pass/fail assignments, no exams. The assignments (incl. 2 short essays) make you read, understand, and apply textbook info. Sync. sessions are for Q&A so bring any questions you have. Use/read the forum. Deadlines are given in advance so work at a good pace.",1
"Funny guy. Made what should have been a really boring course mildly amusing. The material is realyl dry. And the marking on the SRS's is highly variable depending on your client(TA). Takes a while to get used to his speach, but I had no problems after a few classes.",1
"Lectures are bland and don't help much at all, so you basically should get and read the textbook. He doesn't curve anything. This guy just cares and assumes that we supposedly cheat on HW assignments *ROLLS EYES*, even though it's just research because there's no helpful resources available to help for any assignment. AVOID AT ALL COSTS, CANCEROUS.",0
"Brent's awesome.  He sings, he dances, he recites, he loves minerals and wants everyone to know it.",1
There are no outside resources because he teaches using weird fictional characters and if you write anything other than his mythological proofs on the tests and exam its an automatic 0. His textbook is equally as useless because there's no professional reasoning/explanations. his proofs are all based on fairy godmother and little bird,0
Inexperienced Boring Lacks context,0
"Her note taking style is impossible to follow, she doesn't accept outside perspectives for the most part, and is a harsh grader who gives minimal feedback.",0
The textbook is unreadable and he just lectures and there are not really words on his slides so you get to just frantically try and right everything down. I hate that he does current events it takes up too much class time which means more textbook reading. TCU is full of teachers like this and is not worth your money. I am so bitter I chose TCU.,0
worst teacher ever for online classes! her tests are impossible and she never responds to E-mails :(,0
"This good rating does not mean the class is easy. Packy will take your easy A classes and shove them down your throat, and tell you he'll do as much with a smile on his face. However, if you want to actually learn and better yourself, you aren't going to find a better prof to learn from and question about the material and life in general.",1
SUPER boring lectures. Probably the worst lectures I've ever attended.,0
"I had him in high school, possibly one of the best teachers I'd had back then. Now I got him again, I purposefully took this class just to have him teach me again. Without a doubt I can say out of all my current profs he is probably the coolest one I've had so far. He is sarcastic, friendly, and he goes above and beyond. You cannot ask for better.",1
"Prof Hess is super understanding. Just talk to him and he will do everything he can to help you out. TAKE THE PRACTICE TESTS ON THINKWELL- they are literally exact replicas of the tests. I'm terrible at math and this class was hard, but it was totally doable. I really liked online because I could go my own pace. I finished a week ahead of schedule!",1
Easily one of the worst professors Ive ever had. He was completely inaccessible outside of class & routinely told my class to not ask him questions via email. He never stayed on topic in class & gave tests that were heavy on info he never touched on. My class only had 2 exams & a final project so an A was impossible if you did badly on one thing.,0
"AVOID THIS PROFESSOR AT ALL COSTS. I took this class after taking advanced math all throughout high school hoping it would just be a refresher and now I'm failing. Welling does not give notes, doesn't give real assignments, and expects you to know everything for tests despite not teaching. Impossible grader. Only online quizzes and homework.",0
"Saler is a very engaging lecturer, but he speaks very quickly so you have to pay close attention. Grade was based on 2 essays, 1 midterm, 1 final, and online textbook quizes. He gave a very generous study guide for the exams, which are bluebook. The class involves LOTS of reading, around 5 books plus the textbook--so be prepared to read.",1
"This professor is the sweetest professor! Just dont take advantage of her. This class is an easy A, participate, come into class and you'll be fine. Midterm was to volunteer and final was an oral based on a movie. She comes in with candy almost all the time for us, she is definitely one of a kind. You will learn alot!",1
I hated going to his class. It was extrememley confusing and a lot of people just talked to hear themselves speak. I ended up withdrawing from it.,0
"He refers to the books a lot during lecture time. He shows videos, and he is organized. He assigns a ch. to read for a week then the next week he asks questions about the reading to guide us. And he would lecture along. You do the reading then you can participate in class discussion, and it will just be review, and fun. He's also a nice grader.",1
Professor Gomez is extremely rude to his students. I didn't enjoy his monotone lectures or his teaching style whatsoever. He is by far one of the worst professors I've had at HCC.,0
"excellent lecturer. he wants you to do well, but will make you work your ass off for it. he's also super tough on papers, so be sure you triple-check your writing. other than that, I retained most of the information he taught during class, and seriously helped me build a vital fundamental knowledge base for upper-division polisci courses.",1
"His classes were the most boring 5 hours a week I have ever experience , he constantly changes his mind about what he expects from projects and turns a class that has a lot of potential into a tedious process that doesnt take you anywhere.",0
"Lori is a great advisor and person, but I didn't enjoy her as much as a professor. The class was very disorganized and grading criteria wasn't clear. I feel as though some of my grades fell short only because I wasn't sure of her expectations. She is a really nice person, but can sometimes come across condescending when you ask her for help.",1
"I had an amazing time with this professor! Made everything less complicated. She explained the material well, always responded to email , and is a fair grader .She is a great professor would gladly take again.",1
Favorite professor at SDSU so far. He lectures without notes or powerpoint. He is funny/entertaining so I didn't mind going to a 3 hr class at night. If you read the book and go to class you'll be fine. TAKE HIM!,1
Do not take her!She makes no sense! She basically reads the powerpoint and that's about it. She gives a very long review a day Or 2 at the max before a test! The review is not a review! you are literally copying every slide! She never pays attention to the time we get out 45 minutes an hour late out if lecture. We have NO break! Very bad Professor!,0
"Worst instructor in the program. Ambiguous requirements, vindictive behavior, and is disorganized. You must practically beg him for assistance.",0
"I liked the class, but he was a really tough grader.  I thought my final grade was unfair given the amount of effort and time spent inthe photolab, but whatev... I still liked the class.",1
"Good luck if you've got Dr. Pharr. If you can avoid her courses, do yourself a favor and take someone else. Tons of homework, attendance is taken, although I'm not sure how much it really counts for, and no clear guidelines. You might go to class and take a personality quiz, who knows...",0
"This class easily could have been an online class. Homework is exclusively video assignments, and they are on random things. The tests are based on how you take notes, not on the substance of the videos. And in class I did not learn much either.",0
"This professor is the least caring person ever. He never answers emails and could care less to help you pass the class. He claims the class is easy but your final grade is literally determined from 4 things the entire semester and he refused to give you full credit, but won't tell you what you did wrong. Seriously, do ANYTHING to not have him!!!",0
"Total Recommend anyone take this class with the Professor. She is understanding and helpful to those who do not understand the material. To those who are retaking the class like myself, this is definitely the professor to take it with.",1
"Lectures are straight off a powerpoint, which is uploaded online. Wouldn't be necessary to attend class if not for pop-assignments in class. Tests are multiple choice and include oddly specific questions sometimes, but if you read the book and attend class they aren't half bad",0
"This class was hard. He was a very hypercritical grader. I would often go in to office hours because he didnt answer his emails in a timely manner, and he would critique my assignment and if i went in again and ask for help after i had fixed my mistakes he would go in and make more confusing critiques. Hard grader. Heavy lecturer. And a bit werid.",0
"Boyke is a nice guy and willing help if you ask. His lectures are boring and monotone. If you miss class you won't have any notes on the sections, you are expected to follow along in class and take your own notes as you go. I spent about 6+ hours in the tutoring center for this class to stay on top of things and still found this class challenging.",0
"Anita Disney is truly everything you could want in a professor. She's brilliant, caring, engaging, and reasonable. Her class isn't needlessly difficult and I found that I learned more in her course than any other I've taken because I was willing to go above what was asked out of respect to her and interest in the subject. Cannot recommend enough.",1
She has no lesson plan and expects us to learn everything ourselves. She literally puts people on the spot when they are unable to say something in French and its extremely embarrassing. She's rude and is not lenient with anyone whatsoever. Im really about to not ever take French because she's the only professor who available for my schedule.,0
Professor Young is the best professor I have ever had. He is a great guy. So nice and extremely smart. I absolutely loved this class and professor.,1
She's a good teacher but she lacks a lot of communication with students. If you had a question you would not get an answer for a long time and by that time the assignment was already due. Tests are confusing and all over the place it would help if she gave a study guide or outline for it. Doesn't follow syllabus dates. ,0
"I would definitely take professor Lhoest again!  She is a wonderful teacher who is sincerely interested in developing her students in the french language and culture. She gives out extra credit. Tests are not too hard. She gives study guides. Lectures are not boring, but essential to the grade. Missing class is a bad idea you'll fall behind so fast",1
"Mary Shepherd's class was easily the most unprofessional joke of a class I've ever participated in. Her tests are pretty rough, but not impossible. Class averages range from a 30-60%. She justifies this horrendous average by a horrendous amount of homework she expects complete every day. She isn't helpful. She'd rather scream at you than help.",0
"He takes forever to grade. He gives vague comments on your assignments if they are graded. He makes you buy the books he wrote, one of them you never use, the other one is used only once. If you do need him outside of class it is hard to actually email him. He's a good guy but he has high expectations so you need to be devoted to take this class.",0
"Brother Johnson is great. He's the grandfather everyone wishes they had. If you don't know what's that like, take Rel 122 from him. Lectures go by so quickly because he loves what he does. His enthusiasm rubs off on everyone in lecture. Best religion class taken at BYU.",1
Chen is honestly a good professor. For 2552 the exams and quizzes were pretty easy but the best thing you can do for yourself in this class is look up Sebastian Fernandez on YouTube and use his videos. Did this all semester and didn't even need to go to lecture or recitation.,1
"I have never written a review in my life, but this time I would not let it go, Bruce Cohen has no idea what he is teaching, no material in the class, the class goes by bad jokes and arguments, and he is the most racist Professor in the USA.",0
He puts so weightage on tests that he doesn't give enough time for so that his students can fail -_- Don't feel like he really cares for his students.,0
"Awesome class so far, my resume looks much better than other students I've seen. Learning stuff I might actually use. She expects a lot but is willing to help.",1
Explains to people who already understand the material.  He should look up the definition of good teaching.,0
Compared to the other teachers in the department she is one of the toughest. She goes strictly by the book but also adds a lot of extra grades that aren't needed. I feel like I worked so hard and still don't even have the grade I want.,0
We had to do three projects and 2 quizzes. The feedback was minimal and the due dates were way to close together. Midterm was hard but fair.,0
His lectures give useful and useless information. It is difficult to follow with the text book. He will not accept other compiler results besides the department compilers on linux.,0
"Mitterer has a very monotone voice when lecturing. He seems to be very sweet and would regularly show us cool pictures at the beginning of lecture. Despite this, when he went through course material it seemed to be irrelevant on the exam and any assigned work. I probably could have gone to no lectures and passed the semester with flying colours.",0
Professor Thiel is one of the toughest graders ever and it is very hard to earn an A in this course. There is very little room for error in this course especially that it is an intro to philosophy class and he made this course way too hard. I earned an A but I had to work really hard and I recommend you do not take this class.,0
"One of the best courses I've taken at TC, one of the best teachers I""ve encountered at TC.",1
Amazing teaching. You will become a smarter person because of him!,1
Great Teacher. Very Easy and simple ENG102 class for the credit. He is vague on his assignments but there's barely any work. Just ask questions after class and he will explain. 1 Research paper 1500words any topic. short stories and a final exam on the short stories. Cool guy really laidback.Has funny stories he says as well.,1
"He's a great guy, but a poor prof.  Not very clear in class and doesn't give much feed back on Labs or homework.  Tends to confuse himself and the class during lectures.",0
horrible coure.just the structure.if you did all the work without doing bonus labs your max is 75%.she didn't tell us that at the beginning. I attended all classes..worked hard and failed. I asked her to go over her marking and she found 2 assignments that she marked but FORGOT to put in my final mark.other friends had better english teachers!!,0
"I agree, She has her favorite students.  She is unwilling to listen to theories that dissagree with her own, and 'acts' dumb sometimes.  She is obviously a little to feministic, and is very uncreative.  It takes her 15 minutes to say one thing - Worst class ever - but she is nice",0
I did the ratings I did based off of other ratings because I was suppose to get her however she had to be dismissed for my entire semester and a pee-on took her place. Beware of Professor Iverson. Retired teacher of 30 years thinks he knows what he's doing. Don't buy the book if you have him. Wish I could have enjoyed a class with Fritz. :(,1
"Mike was my first informatics class I've taken at UW, but has definitely gotten me much more involved. Ended up with a 3.7 which was decent, but took enough out of the class that the grade didn't matter as much. Start assignments early, they are much tougher than the lecture or textbook.",1
Attendance is mandatory. Class wasn't bad the tests are just extremely hard compared to what you learn in this class. Wasn't the best at answering questions or helping you out,0
"It takes awhile to get to know him and what he is looking for.At first, he is intimidating. But,a very Godly man. He teaches in a manner that is easy to comprehend. Give him a chance, he is a great guy and an excellent Spanish teacher!",1
"His class is a job that you don't get paid for, and if you're like me and you already have a job and a full workload at OSU, it's extremely daunting. You'll never know what will be on his quizzes, sometimes you'll even have them when there's no readings due on the syllabus. I would reccomend you do whatever you can to avoid him.",0
"I didn't attend a single lecture after the first week. He has written all the textbooks for this course and others and just rewrites the pages onto the board. Just read the textbook and take notes from that, much easier to understand. I made cheat sheets for each chapter and then took practice tests. Exam was super easy and comparable to old ones.",0
"So feminism is cool and all, but Neroni seems to think that it is the only concept that influenced film. Ever. Kind of a crappy and misfocused class and professor.",1
"No one stopped any student from getting this experience prior to entering the program, in fact it was recommended to all, for good reason OBVIOUSLY. If a student chooses to do the bare minimum to get into the program, and then expect to be able to continue to do the same and succeed, they didn't belong there to start with.",1
"One of the best, if not *the* best, professors in the department. You will actually learn the importance and usefulness of the subject. He is clear and has a strong grasp on his lecture topics. One of those classes that will open your eyes.",1
"Professor aoki is fantastic. Coming from someone who has anxiety and struggle sin school, I wouldn't suggest taking his class your first year like I did - it was pretty rough. But if you do what you are supposed to and study, you will be fine. He cracks jokes all the time, and his lectures are way interesting. Missed a couple tests and he helped.",1
Boring lectures and a lot of REALLY boring reading. Two essay tests that usually don't coincide with the study guide. I don't recommend unless you really love history.,1
"He has a thick accent, but when confronted he gets defensive and gets mad. He also doesn't like answering questions.",0
TERRIBLE. Worst prof I've ever had. I've taken CHEM 140 as well and both classes were extremely boring and unbearable to endure. Half the class is failing and he seems to do nothing about it. Switching my major after this. Nuff said.,0
Someone with such a lack of respect for American students should go home to whence they came.,0
"Every class was professor Amey talking about random stories that kind of relate to the slides. He gave random pop quizzes almost every other class which were fill-in-the-blank with no word bank on really specific details that he didn't mention in class. I asked him my grade and he said ""he didn't know"". He's nice but doesn't know what hes doing",1
"Great professor who is easy going, willing to help and able to compromise. Example: the class was able to convince him to cancel because of how nice it was outside. In class: mostly lecture, some videos and a short quiz every week based on the reading from the previous week. One test, 11 chapters from the book, and articles. Def. recommended.",1
"She demands contacting via Canvas, which no other professor in HCC does. I tried emailing her for problems with the platform but she ""stated on the syllabus to contact her through canvas"" and that was enough to drop me without giving me even a chance to start the course. Dont risk your time or your money.",0
Lectures are impossible to follow and he'll often begin problems that even he can't do and give up. I learned everything from Khan Academy and the textbook. All the MatLab assignments are near impossible and he doesn't teach any of it in class. The MatLab textbook is also no help at all so don't even buy it and just ask a friend for hw problems.,0
"He flies through the lectures and talks to you like youre stupid if you ask how to do a question in the study guide, which is pointless to ask because his tests are nothing like the study guides. All of his exams feel like hes trying to trick you, because he is. He acts like all of his students are in grad school with him.",0
"I took the online summer course and I knew it would be challenging. But I didn't think it would feel impossible. There is an extreme amount of homework given. I'd say take this course from this professor only if math comes easily to you, and if you can devote 25-30 hours a week to work on it.",0
"She is the worst prof Ive ever had. Ive gone to her office hours for extra help sometimes & she gets flustered if I dont understand right away. I also get extra help from a PhD student in the subject & I still receive low grades despite his help. I dont receive ANY feedback on her assessments, just a mark w no explanation. By far the WORST prof",0
Not very good ,0
I took SOC 231 Intercultural Communications with Vanden Berg and loved him so much I took SOC 130 for core with him. He's really funny and a relaxed prof. He trusts you as a student and doesn't try to micro manage his class. Easy work load but make sure you know your notes for the exams and midterms. Wish I could take more of his classes!,1
"I've had Dr. Chester for 2 classes so far and I highly recommend him (especially for Eng major!)The combination of the books he chooses, his own passion for the material, his easy going nature & style of teaching makes his classes a positive & motivating intellectual experience..if you like that sort of thing that is...",1
"Professor McCarthy is one of my favorite professors at AU. She can be a little tough on grading, but she lets you rewrite the papers and you most likely will get a better grade.  We read some interesting books (a lot of reading at times) and had good discussions. Would highly reccomend.",1
"Potential students,Please take your preq.; know it well. has a power control issue. He will tell U up front, he always win. What ever you do do not challenge his authority, He will target U through out the course and make it very difficult for U.",0
"Professor Bennett is very approachable, nice, accommodating to her students and is willing to change due dates on major assignments. Her classes mainly consist of group work, but she does let students choose their own group members. If you want to earn a good grade, do yourself the favor of keeping up with all of the canvas discussions.",1
She does not answer emails. It is a professor's job to respond to emails.,0
This class was awesome! Super easy and I found it interesting. He does a great job at explaining assignments and providing informative videos.,1
"most of your assignments are done in class!!!!! do not miss class!!! honestly a solid choice of a professor. Not an easy class, but she let me turn one of my papers in late and redo a couple assignments i did bad on.",1
"It is nearly impossible to understand him and he does not know how to really teach. He may be smart but he is an awful teacher(he spends the entire class time explaining the same thing 12 times, saying the exact same thing over and over again, but not actually clarifying anything.)You're only chance is if a classmates knows it and can teach you.",0
"DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS, if you do you will spend the semester confused and teaching yourself out of the book.",0
"Very odd grading scale, grades off what she thinks is right instead of using the correct rubric",0
"Marc is a great professor.  Some kids can't get over the Marxism, but that's typically because they don't understand either the theory or the social sciences in general.  Only take his class if you are open minded and interested in theoretical/comparative politics (econ majors tend to take his classes and quickly realize their ignorance).",1
"Spends most time talking about her personal life even though she doesn't know your name. Is a very difficult grader, literally took off for misspelling words. You will rarely leave lab early. Highly recommend switching to another professor because this lab was harder than the actual class.",0
She was horrible. Took her as my first class and there was absolutely no remorse for me as someone new to college and the hybrid format. She took the class way too seriously considering it's a required class and rather pointless in the age of the internet.,0
"Seems to be quite knowledgeable and a pretty nice guy, but a terrible teacher. He does not know how to explain things well. There were very few notes to take in the class because he passed out tons of packets of notes (and then doesnt use them. He uses maple all the time instead of showing how to do problems by hand. Mumbles a lot as well. Avoid!",1
"He was really fun to listen to in class and had interesting material. The only issue is that he's tough -- I've given in a curatorial project that I worked really hard on and only received a C+. He's very straightforward with grading, so at least you'll get decent feedback.",1
"good teacher; no tolerance for those without respect or who are ""stupid""; sometimes i couldn't understand him simply because of his accent; the flow of the class seemed sort of disjointed, but overall i learned a lot and would take another course taught by him.",1
You don't attend Thurs and have DBs about movies instead those days. Proceeded to look around at what people said the movie was about then pretend I watched it too. Final project poorly explained. No lectures in class; all you do is discuss assigned readings in groups. Why is this not an online class? Ugh. I couldn't take her seriously.,0
He doesn't explain properly. I hardly understand what he says and he goes from topic to topic so quickly,0
Lapp is a great professor to have and he will be there for you when you need help. Most students in his class do not take advantage of his office hours so therefore they are left confused. If you pay close attention to lapp's lectures you will understand the material.,1
"DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFFESOR. Class is just him reading off a powerpoint slide, very boring, and very hard not to fall asleep. Class material is easy to learn, but he makes it very difficult to enjoy it. Tough grader. And only has one perspective when grading. Tests are made up of multiple choice with some of the questions made from his opinion.",0
"Nichols may be a goofy bald man, but between the giggles and the chin rubbing, this might have been the most i've learned in any class.  interesting stuff too.",1
"Prof Pham is one of the best math teachers I've ever had. She lectures for one day then the second day of the week she designates to practice problems. She provides study guides with the exact/similar questions for tests. For labs, I recommend choosing THURS so you can do the lab beforehand and getting it checked off. She is very genuine and sweet.",1
This was his first semester teaching 202 which is why I think he went easy on grading. Keep up with readings because he doesn't always announce quizzes. Drops lowest quiz grade. Had to work with a partner for 3/4 projects and you get maybe 2 weeks to do each of them. Tests aren't that bad. The projects and homework are the stressful part.,1
"helpful, giving good lecture but very tough grader",0
"Very tough marker, very funny, instructions not very clear for assignments and labs.",0
Worst professor in the world!!!! Do not take her or you will fail!,0
"Wendy MacCaul is without a doubt the worst prof I've had to date in my university career. She loves to shoot you down to your lowest, my personal favorite quote of hers was, ""You guys have been down hill since grade primary"".. refering to us not understanding a problem I hope they fire her!shovelass",0
I never had a worse teacher. He knows the material but can't teach it.  I spent most of my time in the Math Lab (great crew)! I went to him for help and got the impression I was wasting his time. Don't take his class unless you are a Math major.,0
She really does care about her students but her tests were confusing as hell. One of them was nothing like the review for it. You do many problems out of the book in class to try and help with understanding the material. Go to class if you want the attendance points (free points). This class left me frustrated many days.,1
Prof Rizzella really likes cognition and it shows. She knows her stuff and loves what she does. She doesn't act superior like so many other profs!,1
Professor Nartey has to be the absolute worst teacher at Siena College being in his class made me so upset because he was so mean and rude towards the students. You do not want to take him he isnt kind and he doesnt act how a professor should. If you take his class beware of him hes horrible.,0
"He uses his own textbook which is just a bunch of other textbooks jammed into one, and then charges over $100 for it. He didn't show up for class 90% of the time, and when he did he screamed ""DEBT"" over and over in people's ears. He's not the best by far. Then again what do you expect from the Head Dean?",0
"Boring and stiffly well-mannered (not friendly). A teach-yourself class; lectures consisted of the captions of the pictures in the text, verbatim, nothing more. Lecture exams didn't always follow the text, so you couldn't fully prepare yourself since the only way to teach yourself was from the text. No help given during labs.",0
"Amazing professor! Super easy A. Simply a fun class to attend. You get to watch movies, play games and have interesting discussions. Tests are short, multiple choice, and questions come straight off the powerpoints. If you miss a class just send her an e-mail and she'll send you the powerpoint and gladly answer any questions you have.",1
"Isn't very nice. I had a personal emergency and she was the only professor to not be accommodating. She takes attendance before class begins to start the lecture on time, but this means if you aren't EARLY you are late.",0
Has a hard time speaking. only information is pre made slides. recommend not taking him.,0
"VERY awesome and kind professor. He teaches well, teaches a lot but his exams are ALWAYS what's taught in the class. He reviewed every exam we took the day before the exam and including the final. Final was WAY too hard in my opinion but he will work with the class. If a test is too difficult he will eliminate one question or count as extra credit.",1
"Furlong is a good prof but goes on tangents way too much in this particular class. Assignments are graded unnecessarily hard and very memorization heavy. Hard to see all your efforts translate to good grades. Another thing that bothers me, he assumes that you know alot of the background material already.",0
"If you arent a history major it is not a good idea to take him, and if you are you should only take him if you have to. His jokes are corny and talks to you like you are in middle school. He doesn't make anything interesting and his lectures are powerpoints and very dry!",0
"I never thought a better class could be possible. Dante's Inferno with Niccoli drags you through Heaven and Hell, Literally. With Nicolli teaching, everything is right as long as it is justified. Your views are as important to him and the class as his are. A MUST TAKE!",1
"DO NOT TAKE THIS SEQUENCE!!! The class is horrible, and Professor Webster seems to top it off. He doesn't use Blackboard so you have no grade all semester until he puts in your final grade, which cannot be changed after that. His syllabus doesn't equate to the average grade. Only good thing about the man is he allows rewrites.",0
"Good teacher, if you ask him a question he explains it to you. Test are hard, if you don't understand the material you won't do well. Lab reports are hard. You definitely have to work for an A. SI sessions are a good idea because he gives bonus points on your tests for going. Quizzes are easy points.",1
Hauck is the best professor I have ever had. He prepares you very well for the exams and makes sure you know the material well. Would take again.,1
Be prepare to participate.... he takes participation very serious. You get a grade every few weeks for participation. Do not miss class because he will take points off. You need the book for the class. He is very passionate about what he teaches.,0
very hard tests,1
"Good at explaining things but goes through slides way to fast and doesnt lie to give breaks, he also makes us do our online quizzes on sunday morning and makes us record your laptops, werido",0
"Most content is in the lectures, but you'll want to read the book if you want a high A (last few weeks require the book). Not a difficult class by any means, so it's a good one to take over the summer. The labs were my favorite part of this class because he walked us through each step while encouraging the class to be creative and fun with it.",1
Awesome guy- extremely friendly and happy. Material is HARD. I still don't understand half of the material and it's the last day. Don't take this class unless you are a neurologist or biology major. It's not a psychology course.,0
"She was very very clear. Very precise, Very organized. She was always prepared for class & on time. Interesting most of the time, and I believe she enjoyed teaching these courses with personal interest.",1
"This class was amazing, the one thing is there were no lectures, just powerpoints posted and we read them ourselves. Not a lot of assignments either which is always great. The course overall was great just no lectures!",1
"This is the second time I've taken this professor, and the second time I've regretted it.  Hard grader, and not very willing to help as far as I have seen.  Gives 11 possible essay questions and three will be on the exam, but they are hard questions and very time consuming.  I don't say this very often, but if you can avoid, do it. One 10 pager.",0
"Really great teacher!! Not only does she teach intersting classes which helps, she actually knows what she is talking about.  Very hard marker though.  You really hope the TAs mark your assignments",1
Just retire!  Terrible teacher.,0
"Knows what he's talking about, and will help you understand it. Very interesting class with simulations to mock real world examples.",1
Very funny and outgoing! As long as you read the books and take notes it's an easy A!,1
"He's the absolute best professor I've had for any science class by far!! Prof Crumpler cares about each and every one of his students and definitely does his best to make sure everyone passes. He goes off his powerpoints (based on the text) and gives out a lot of practice problems. Love him, he makes chemistry so easy.",1
"Extremely opinionated, not willing to give help when you ask and doesn't seem to care about his students. He will act like a kind, understanding person in class, but if you go talk to him personally, he is cold, insensitive and uninterested in whatever you have to say. I hope I never have him as a prof again - 2 classes was more than enough.",0
"Professor Collier is a really great teacher. His lectures are interesting and he makes them relative to his students. He always opens up the floor for anyone who wants to talk about whatever.  His tests aren't too hard, just make sure you read the textbook and stay up to date on current events. I highly recommend taking his class.",1
He is just the cutest and i felt bad about how miserable the class was. I could barely keep my eyes open. Everyone creates google docs for the current topic and textbook exams so attendance is pointless except for clicker points. It's an easy A for a gen ed if youre willing to listen to an old guy in an array of hawaiian shirts read online articles,1
Hawks is the platform used to teach math from module 1 till 11. This class is COMPLETELY self taught. The test grades very precise so if you dont answer the question in the format they want you 2 you will get the entire question wrong. Prof Hunter was great. He is willing to help if you need that extra push. But you have to put in your OWN WORK.,1
"Dr. Ferguson is a very nice man, however, his class has a lot of ""busywork."" There is a ton of reading required and his lectures are sometimes hard to follow.",1
He's why I teach Earth Science...very influential and passionate...and the sense of humor just kills me...THAT MOOOVIE...haha,1
"With professor Talu you either like her teaching style or you don't. If you go to her class, you will do well in the class. The exams can be hard but she is one of the better Econ teachers at CWRU.",1
She is very picky with her instructions and expects way too much out of an online course. She makes it very confusing and complicated to submit your work.,0
"Disregard your textbook.  Bailey tests purely from his notes and what was said (or what he thinks he said) in class.  If you study from his notes, your test scores should be adequate.  He prides himself on his small pass rate.  My class started with approx. 24 students.  We ended with 9 students.",0
"Fantastic. As long as you do the homework and projects in CS121, you will easily get the hang of it. Attendance replaces your lowest test score. So go to class. If you're learning a programming language, you really don't want to miss class anyway. Did not use the book at all.",1
"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS PEOPLE! Terrible professor, 0 explanations, unclear grading. Your grade basically depends on a 10 page paper that is ridiculously specific! Look for another professor... trust me",0
Very nice professor. Easy A. Must take her!,1
"degrades students, not helpful, very vague, worst teacher at suny brockport by far.",0
"Dr. Simms is very knowledgeable of the subject, but he is not good at explaining things to people who do not understand the subject. He's hard of hearing, asking questions during class is kinda hard unless you literally yell. There was a paper to write, and there was no clear idea of what he wanted, AKA no outline.",0
"I participated frequently and turned in all assignments on time. I am getting an A. However, I despise her. ""Terrible choice for Department head. I feel like sometimes she thought she was teaching 7th graders...plot, tone, antagonist. Don't take her if you know ANYTHING about English already - I wanted to gouge out my own eyes."" <perfectly said",0
"Herion fueled rage, this was the most awesome class ever he will really get you juiced up.",1
He is a great guy.  He actually cares for the students and is available for help at all times.  He really sacrifices his own time to assist others.,1
"nice man, boring lectures, difficult tests, not gonna be a cakewalk, go to class, best advice: review your notes the day you learned the material in class",1
Trust me. AVOID. Worst experience ever.,0
"I took Oldfather for AMH. Her powerpoints aren't the best and neither are her review sheets. All of the information she provides is from what she says in class, none of it is in the powerpoint or review sheets. I studies a lot and I got a C in the class because it was hard to keep up with everything she says. She is a little funny though ",0
"Nichols is an amazing professor--managed to make a course often regarded as filler extremely interesting.  Nichols speaks animatedly and is willing to engage students in a fast-paced, firm, yet comedic manner.  Harder than other Civ sections, but well worth the added papers/readings and final.  Very accommodating.  You will enjoy this course.",1
"I took two different accounting classes from him at WCC. Since he has a great background in real accounting fields, I got into the class and found myself interested. I was just taking them because of requirements at first, but Ken caught my interests and even made me think of changing majors. I am really thinking to major in Accounting now. ",1
"Do not let the amount of homework deter you from this professor. Professor Saba really cares about the material and his students. One of the few professors I felt I had a good relationship with. As long as you provide something interesting for the projects, his grading isn't too bad. I got an A the first time I took him and a B+ the second.",1
"Great professor! He is very helpful and kind. He makes a hard topic very understandable. You do notes before class and then come in and work on problems with a group that you get to pick. I hate working in groups, but it was very helpful. There are 2 test and one final. There are also a couple of homework assignments, but are easy.",1
"Ms. Sunny is an easy ""A"" in any class. She helps you on all the paper you write(by the way therre is only four;]). Sometimes she is really unclear about what she wants exactly. However, she will let you do the assignment until you get it write. She is also very outspoken.",1
"Dr. Jordan is a funny guy and tried to make the material interesting, which honestly it kind of was. Once you get how he teaches and how he words test questions, you should be fine. Two exams and one final plus 10% of your grade is clicker points. Do the readings and extra credit hw. Not really a hard breadth class as long as you put in effort",1
"I would never take this teacher again. She doesnt care about her students. If we asked her a question, she made us feel stupid. Anyone who purchased an eBook could not use it because she hates the sound of clicking through pages. Just a waste of money and time. Beware!",0
"Class felt somewhat disconnected. She's not really receptive to feedback. If she asks a question in class and nobody knows the answer, she will act as if we are all mentally incapable. Grading is average, she gives partial credit. You must do your homework, she randomly checks it for credit. Quizzes nearly every class. Exams are relatively easy.",0
"Very calm and collected, wise and noble man. His classes are entertaining and interesting. There are few things that are graded in Gen Psych for instance - 4 paper assignments with prompts and 4 exams + final. His tests are 11 questions multiple choice 11 true or false and 11 questions fill in the blank. This class is very note heavy if taken onlin",1
"Bolkovac's problem is that he thinks he knows everybody... He is too closed minded; still a good musician with lots of exp. BUT he has FAVORITISM problems, he tries hard to be nice, but sometimes is overrated.",0
I did not find this class helpful.  Most of the information we learned came right from a textbook.  We learned this material in health and wellness but have to take it for majors.,0
Ted is an excellent professor who will be sorely missed,1
"Would never recommend, professor is really unclear in wording on quiz questions, impossible to get full points on anything. She does not seem to want her students to succeed. Unstructured class.",0
"Hard class! Hes very smart, but his exams are more in depth that what he teaches in class.",0
"Amazing, caring, lecture heavy class but slides are useful. Reviews questions in class if asked ahead of time, HW not graded.. Makes the tough concepts just a little easier. Exams are fairly like the HW. Did tons of review for the final, gives study guide for both midterm+final. Had 10-15min quizzes for content questions or attendance quizzes.",1
"One of my favorite teachers, very helpful and a nice person.",1
"Best CRJ professor I've ever had. Not only do you learn the material, you have a great time in class and actually look forward to going. She's funny and kind yet serious when she needs to be but trust me, SHE DOES NOT PLAY so do not take advantage of her kindness; otherwise assignments are fair and tests are cake, make sure to study!",1
He was unhelpful and expected too much. When he said that for the past few years his first test average is a D he wasn't kidding and to me that says that he's either not teaching or he's expecting too much. Very heavy on SOC for a theme class LOTS of reading. Don't take if you don't have a lot of time and SOC knowledge,0
"Dr. Riley is a great teacher that knows his stuff.  A sure ""A"" in the class if you know the study guide.",1
"Don't take this class unless you need it. A completely ridiculous amount of work, 2 chapters a week finishing a 688 pg book in less than 2 months with a quiz on the 2 chapters each week and an hour to 2 hour documentary and discussion post or more reading. You also get an 8 page research paper to do while all this is going on. ",1
"He makes you work ridiculously hard for an A, and all of the comments he writes are 100% illegible. I went to his office hours and he could not even read the comments he wrote on my paper. He also gave me a B on a paper because he thought I used an incomplete sentence and then he realized I didn't but  didn't change my grade. He's a nice enough guy",0
"I THOUGHT THIS INSTRUCTOR WAS QUITE INTERESTING. I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE A REALLY INTERESTING CLASS, BUT I FOUND IT TO BE EXTREMELY BORING AND REPETITIOUS. THE INSTRUCTOR WAS VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT WHAT HE WAS TEACHING, BUT RARELY GOT THE CLASS TO PARTICIPATE IN DISCUSSION AND THE NOTES WERE RIDICULOUS. HE WRITES EVERYTHING HE SAYS..NOT COOL",0
"I took this prof for PS 110 in the summer semester. I was so nervous because of the online format. I had trouble with my Cengage code and emailed him. He emailed me before class started to make sure that I was good! Class consisted of watching a video, answering questions, taking a test and writing a 300 word essay. Great prof and cares about you!",1
"Schola was awesome.  As long as you put in your best effort and showed up for class, you got a decent grade.  Fun variety of music, lots of sight-singing but you get accustomed to it.  Definitely recommend.",1
"Class and Professor Unorganized and unclear. Never know what is expected. Arrogant, self serving,controlling, retained hardly anything. If you can take a different professor for this class I would recommend it.",0
You will not be disappointed at the end of the semester!,1
Professor Moton lives and breathes English. He even wrote a few books about it ! If you live and breathe for English this class is for you . He has us do 8-10 page essays in his class also,0
"she's my advisor and she's useless. i went to her to get help with my schedule because i'm a transfer and she gave me a sheet with wrong information on it and told me to figure it out. i've not been back to ask for help. I have had to tell her what classes i need for my major, she does not want to take time for her students unless they suck up her.",0
"Dr. Liszka is simply amazing!  She has fantastic real world metaphors that make even the most difficult concepts easy to understand.  As long as you don't slack off, and do the work, you can't fail her class.  She is extremely fair and very helpful in her office hours.",1
"Overall a pretty good guy. Not always the most interesting lectures, but I didnt enjoy this class. Do your readings, study and get involved and this class is a piece of cake.",1
"Sp 20 Honestly speaks in Spanish the whole time, youll be lost, and shes got a lot of attitude when she emails you. Stay clear",0
"Guys I am begging you to nott take this Otway guy's astronomy class! Just like this other person said- I dont know how he is in his math classes, but if you are planning on taking astronomy, DONT!!!! it is rediculous and youll learn nothing and then take difficult tests that have nothing to do with what you studied! everyone felt this way!",0
"For the love of god, transfer from her class if you are scheduled for it.  In high school, I got A's in math - in her class, I barely pulled a B and had to teach myself -everything- I learned nothing from class other than she takes attendance.",0
"Stats=boring.  Kim=Super Perky, An OK course tought by an outstanding prof",1
"Single greatest professor I had throughout my BA and two MAs.  Made a true impact on my life both personally and academically.  Interesting, funny, compassionate and intelligent.  I truly feel bad for those who had a poor experience with him.",1
I really dislike having him as a prof. He gives way too many homework problems that are doing the same things over and over again. He doesn't show up for meetings with students and isn't very approachable and helpful. I wouldn't recommend taking a class with him in the near future or ever.,0
"Textbook is useless. Open note exams, easy to do well on those. Interesting guest speakers. Presenting in front of the whole class was challenging but the marking of them seemed relaxed/fair. A few essays to write though! Overall a boring class in which not that much is learned for which there is not much of an excuse not to get an A+.",0
Great professor! I took him for ENG 1101 and 1102 and passed both classes with A's. He's very professional and passionate about the subject he teaches. He has the entire class outlined day-to-day so you know when everything is due and what you'll be doing in class. I also feel he's very generous when it comes to grading papers.,1
"BEAUTYY of a prof, although I took the course online, and did terrible, it was worth it.",1
A lot of people love this teacher. I am not one of them. His tests are unnecessarily tricky which is unrealistic with text editors. He is always late to class which is inconsiderate of student's time. His jokes are dumb and I don't like his personality.,0
"I worked my butt off in his class to earn a C by the end of the semester - It didn't help I dislike chem., but he failed to teach me well, horrible teacher - awkward man",0
"The class is very political and one-sided, so if you have certain political beliefs, youll feel alone and attacked. He assigns tons of reading, sometimes over 100 pages between classes (more than what the syllabus says). Hes very approachable outside of class and is very helpful. In class, hed sometimes insult students.",0
"He very experienced and teach us new technology and methodology like Agile, scrum etc.",1
"Professor Pinson is spacey and disorganized. If you can't handle that, definitely don't take her class. Takes forever to reply to emails and forgets what she did or didn't assign. Her class was sometimes interesting though and it was not hard to do well in. Don't take if you hate group projects.",0
"Course was interesting but he made it so BORING. The only thing you get from him is grade and big stories. Can't figure it out what you have learned at the end of course. I just end up with him cause there are no better professors. In my view, he is in lowest scale of professor's list.Won't take him again and certainly do not recommend to anybody",0
"Her lectures are very easy to follow and she is always helpful in office hours and if you need extra help. She does a good job teaching a tough subject, but the way she structures her exam are impossible. You are not allowed to backtrack and she often throws in things not mentioned in lecture. Good teacher but makes impossible tests.",1
She is an awesome insturctor.  I had her last semester and received an A.  I worked hard for it but she made math fun.  This semester I have a terrible Math teacher and I wish I would have dropped it already.  I wish all teachers were like her.,1
Professor McAdam is seriously one of the BEST TEACHERS I've ever had. Firstly she is hilarious.  She always listens to our feedback and really listens to us.  She's simply awesome. I would never wanna miss her class simply because i loved it! she has a couple of quizzes that are basically vocab and some essays.  Take her class is you have the chanc,1
"Terrible prof, very anal retentive about minor issues. Goes through content too fast then wastes time talking about her son. She missed a class due to personal reasons and rescheduled the class on a Friday during a time where others may have had classes. And then she refused to post the notes of that class online. Take with someone else if you can",0
Awesome teacher. Very very knowledgeable.,1
I loved her.,1
"AMAZING. Absolutely no question, he is the BEST professor I have ever had.",1
"Not clear about grading or what's on the exams. All learning is done outside class. The actual class period is 10% slides, 20% videos, 70% sitting in awkward silence while students struggle to answer questions that are unanswerable. He is great at teaching ethics, but fails at teaching sustainability (2nd half of class).",0
"tends to rant about random topics in class. He'll pick out really obscure historical events and focus on them for days. Not too bad, but definitely not fun. One time we actually talked about the rap group fu-schnickens for an entire class period. other than that though it kinda sucks. research papers are the only grades. avoid him.",0
"Very difficult class.  He expected us to have background in the subject and made us feel like idiots when he would ask questions, because no one in the class was an AD major, so none of us had any idea what was going on.",0
"Orgo is hard in general, but wituckis exams are near impossible. Prepare to study for the rest of time because no matter what you do her exam questions are so difficult. Way harder than examples done in class. 15 answer options to chose from. Notes are laid out extremely well and she's not a bad lecturer but exams make u fail",0
"Mrs. Hanratty has been one of the best teachers I've had, but she is not easy. The criteria for her papers are tough ad she is not an easy grader. However, she really teaches you the subject without just slapping an A onto your paper. She gives lots of helpful feedback. I would recommend her to anyone looking for a little more than just an easy A.",1
"very smart prof & interesting lectures that basically talk about the reading assigned the night before to help you understand exactly how it relates to class. weekly 1pg writing not very hard, papers suck but not impossible. no text book just had small books to read for each unit.. great class over all highly recommended :)",1
"He is really hard, I would not recommend taking him unless you have lots of spare time. He is really funny and a great teacher, but if you do not understand the material in class, you are out of luck. The class is very fast-paced and he assigns tons of homework. Do not take him if you have a learning disability because he does not understand them.",0
I have taken this class elsewhere as an undergrad. At SFSU I took this at a graduate level expecting further depth. Was disappointed in the quality of the material. The instructor has experience in image processing but clearly is behind the curve in AI and pattern analysis. Not worth my time or money. ,0
"Tough class. Professor Grissom expects a lot and grades tough.  Exams are hard. Study, make sure you understand the concepts, and attend class!  Take advantage of office hours!",1
"It was a huge pain to take his class but was worth the effort. Every week, we had to read 2 long chapters and write summary/response for each chapter as we had to take quizzes on the same chapter during class. He does roll call and if you missed your name by 30 sec, you are marked late. Overall, he teaches interesting stuff & Ur Effort  Ur grade.",1
"Mr. Fu makes every effort to ensure his students are understanding the material being taught, even circling the room to answer questions.  He is very knowledgeable and shares his experience.  A bit old school though, so if your going to think outside of the box do it in someone else's class, it will not be appreciated here.",1
"She's always available to reach out to when needed via social media, email, and phone. I enjoyed the class and as long as you do the work she assigns, you'll pass with flying colors! ",1
"Mr. Pollack clearly cares about his students. He's willing to work with people who share his vision. If you don't share that vision, your grade is doomed, especially if you don't listen to his long-winded rants. He also tends to invite his students on dates. :/",0
"Straight A student here, Hollist assigns work in his intro class as if we were all writing majors with no other classes. At least 3 readings before each class, puts everybody on the spot, each student pretty much teaches 4 classes a semester, incredibly unclear and unreliable grader, he grades a first draft as a 7/10 and then a second at a 3/10.",0
"Outstanding Professor. Very clear, knows his subject and more importantly knows how to teach his subject.",1
Very very vague assignment instructions. I had no idea what I was doing the entire time in this course. It was mandatory for me but his classes are not mandatory don't take them! He is also really quiet and zones out a lot. He does not explain anything in class or on paper.,0
Worst Professor. Her teaching is only for those she favors. She is really mean and has a very bad attitude. She acts really tough and bossy mainly because she is the director of the theater program.,0
"Professor Grant is a terrible professor to take if you enjoy accounting. She doesn't teach the material at all and expects you to learn it all on your own. She spends every class period talking about herself ,how successful she is and how much money she has. Very mean to students when they don't do well on exams. She will ruin accounting.",0
"Do not take him, I repeat, do not. I wish I read stuff other people say about this guy before I got into his class. Sure, he is a nice guy. But his instructions are absolutely unclear (he thinks that he is..), a hardcore grader, will not let you leave early unless the fire alarm comes on. If you are taking him, I salute to your bravery.",0
...you forget stuff you used to know,0
"not a bad class, but it was a dull topic so we didnt look forward to it. he is funny and knowledgable. i recommend him",1
Interesting class. A rational approach to religion. Not all are committed to reason. Be prepared to read and discuss the material.,1
Very understanding and helpful,1
great guy with good stories,1
"Class wasnt anything what was described in the course catalog, which professor acknowledged later on. Heavy readings every week, more than Ive had for even upper divs. A lot of it feels like its not connected to the topic at all. Spends too much time on simple concepts, and not enough on the hard ones.",0
"Never and I mean NEVER take this professor. She is a very kind lady, but doesn't teach well. ""What does the book say?"" is her favorite line when you need help. Labs are unorganized and no one had any clue what they were doing. I am a good student and tried my hardest to understand, but it was just impossible. I had to withdrawal.",0
Don't take this class with him. You learn on your own plus his tests are nothing like what he talks about in class. He makes you do useless assignments. Lecture time is totally useless. You never know your grade. Don't get surprised when you see a lot of people dropping. Stay away from him,0
"A lot of extra credit opportunities, if you are good at self studying then this is an easy A. Roughly half my class got an A+.",1
"Very cool, helpful and knowledgable professor. Would like to take his course again if possible:)",1
"The grade consist of 5 ""quizzes""(1 is a syllabus test). The test will feel easy if you attend the lectures and read the textbook. Very interesting class, great prof. She is so caring and the energy in class is so positive. Many's favorite class. The discussion in townhall is welcoming and nice to listen and engaged to.",1
"She calls herself ""gold"" undergrad lecturer. But in reality she needs to watch for her bias which strongly favors women.  extra credit for females who completed extra homeworks, while letting a missed homework for others give me and others a D in the class. (refusing to give a late assignment credit, even on the first 1",0
Sweetest lady I have ever met. makes sitting in class enjoyable. Follow with the course packet and you will be fine for any test or quiz. She raps a review before every exam definitely worth showing up for that.,1
"I thought that the class was okay. Not super interesting, but not super hard either. Dave Barker is very helpful and he is willing to give personal help to his students when they need it.",1
"I loved taking this class.  Professor Mancini is great. All you have do is complete your assignments. points are taken for lateness. However, this was a easy B.",1
Class is easy and organized. All homework and due dates is notified on day one,1
Seriously my FAV. by far! great professor! makes class interesting! great sense of humor!,1
"During lectures, he provides notes but his notes are not clear and it is easy to get lost in the class. He tries to give examples but his examples are also not clear and he likes to go off topic. I do not recommend his class as you will still need to go and read another teacher's (Perry) notes to pass. Let's just say I struggled a lot to pass.",0
"She is very nice and helpful , I",1
"No matter the teacher, Math 191 is a a lot of work..Mrs. Kolitsch works hard to help you understand the material and goes out of her way to give you everything you need to do well in her class. I highly recommend her to any student who needs this class.",1
He is a great instructor. He throws good amount of assignments and can be overwhelming but he is very helpful during weekly drill if you ever get stuck. I've learned a lot and really liked the class.,1
"Professor Ye is worst teacher I ever took. His test is ridiculously hard. He doesn't curve the grade at all, not extra credit neither. If I have a choice  I wouldn't take him. Someone would say I am a lazy student so I have bad experience but NO. I  actually study really hard for this class, but half the class disappear after the break of his class",0
"The material is easy, and this instructor does everything she can to make this class the opposite. There are more assignments than anyone can keep up with. This can lead to some half-effort work, but more or less she'll always find a way to take points off a lab report/worksheet. The most nit picky grader you will see. She is not the best choice.",0
"I took this class over winter term, he did a really good job of condensing the material without making it feel rushed or overwhelming. ",1
"I had her a semester ago and loved her so much I took another class with her. However, this time is completely different. I don't feel like she's teaching me anything herself, I'm ""learning"" through the 60+ pages of nightly reading. Very very heavy on reading - a little disappointed",1
great medecine always taste extremly bad...that is what this class is.,1
She's nice. Just prepare for paper then you'll be fine.,1
"Mr. Jensen can seem a little kooky at first, but just take time to get to know him and you will learn to love him. He definitely makes you question things and get you out of your comfort zone so be prepared for that. He is very much about attendance and punctuality so be on time. Other than that he's a pretty laid back, funny guy. ",1
BEST PROFESSOR IN FRENCH this department has to offer. Best teacher I had in my four years as a language major. I will miss this lady instensly when i graduate.,1
DO NOT TAKE A CLASS WITH THIS MAN! Worst professor at GVSU,0
Taken her twice. She's super nice and caring and if you're struggling she definitely wants to help. Dont skip class though and if you have a crazy excuse make sure its true cause she will check in with you to verify. I know she has called parents before about funerals. She's a great professor though.,1
If you really enjoy art history then this class is for you. It's not easy but it's worth it. Prepare yourself for heavy memorization/understanding different art works -she only asks for Title and name of Artist in tests.,1
"I am a B+/A student but nearly failed his class. Asked for help and clarification, but all I got were vague apathetic answers. Got a paper back and his only note was on his dislike of my writing style and writing PROCESS what?(the claim he made was untrue) There is a major difference in criticizing and critiquing and only one makes a good teacher.",0
Is not attentive to students. She does not answer emails. Grading is straight foward but assignments are beyond confusing. Textbook used is confusing as well. ,0
take her. she is good.,1
"As a person he seems nice, but as a teacher it is quite the opposite, he almost always has a problem with a student, and is strict about tardies, be very careful to not get on his bad side which is very easy. If you ask him any questions he will not answer them, and if you answer A question wrong he will make you feel bad, even if you dont know it",0
"Although the class is easy, she will decrease your mark just to respect the York University bell curve policy. She is UNFAIR, her lectures are boring, she doesn't give more than 80 on the presentations, she does not care for students. She's very fake and will smile at you but won't hesitate to decrease your mark. NEVER TAKING A CLASS WITH HER AGAIN",0
"I took Dr. Folk's precalculus class and although I thought he was very nice, some of the ways he explains things can be confusing. But he is certainly willing to help you, supply you with different resources, and give you the things you need to be successful. There is a large emphasis in this class to prepare you for calculus.",1
"Professor is really bad at communicating. Her videos are very monotonous and hard to sit through, while Paul Chow's are fine. On the exams, expect point deductions in the strangest places for requirements that exist in the professor's head, but were never stated in the question.",0
"He is funny, at times, and you can tell he LOVES geology,which is good, but he doesn't know how to teach this course effectively to his students. He doesn't let us go over our test results and he is a bit condescending at times. We only used the text twice. Our lab prof. had to pick up his slack. Cage is a good man but not the best instructor.",0
Awful teacher. Adds layers upon layers of unneeded complexity to questions to make you learn during an actual exam. Average is 60 in my class. Awful teaching style. Do not take this class if it is an elective. I am speaking from 4 years experience in school with a high average. Also profits of a useless textbook she helped write. It is useless!.,0
"One of the sweetest professors ever but also the hardest class I've ever done. I did well in Bio 151 but this class is too hard. FIil-in the blank (with no word bank) quizzes every week, and hard tests. She thinks everyone has a passion for bio and gives wayyyy too much information. My friends are bio-oriented majors and agree that its too hard.",0
"Fantastic Professor. A literary giant. Intensely critical, but totally reasonable and fair. Classes are not easy, but are more rewarding than any other class I've taken in my college career. YOU ARE LUCKY TO TAKE HER CLASSES, TAKE ADVANTAGE.",1
"Great person but terrible professor. Just comes to class and writes proofs on the board straight from the book, doesn't really care for developing intuition and big-picture understanding. Very fast-paced: it feels like she only teaches for the top 10% of the class. The class has no TA, no practice exams, no additional resources. Duke Math is evil.",0
"Professor Stralka was recommended to me for 0910, as I really needed my hand held through math. Her teaching method was so helpful. She is really one of a kind! She was great at explaining everything step by step to the class and took the time to make sure we understood the material. Diane is a caring, smart, and silly. I'm so glad I took her!",1
"I have mixed feelings after having Nikkel for Biochem. His exams were extremely hard, due to the 5-6 chapters that they covered. You have to FULLY understand all the material to be successful on exams. He is very knowlegable, and fair by replacing lowest with final and curving several exams, but he is very bad at teaching. GET A TUTOR!!!",0
I hate him with a passion. Don't take him. He sucks.,0
"Geat professor, Group project, Exercises from the book and quizzes. Only comment is the quizzes have two attempts and she uses the average not the highest. Book is a necessity, all quizzes and homeworks are directly from the book and strict deadlines ! Do all the work and read the book to pass!",1
"He uses a ""flipped classroom,"" so basically, you are paying $4,500 to teach yourself the entire course and then have him grade your tests. He has a thick accent so his lectures are a little difficult to understand, and they're SUPER boring, but he's a nice guy and will provide help if you need it.",0
She is very caring about ones progress. Sometimes she would make several spelling mistakes on the board but those are just human mistakes. She offers a lot of extra credit and would go over tests to see our mistakes and where we can improve. She uses English a bit much but it's fine to better understand. She creates this welcoming atmosphere.,1
"Lab is extremely easy and the TA's are very helpful. However, Kelley's exams are so difficult! Everything on the exams are not taught in class. She goes out of her way to put things on the exam that she doesn't teach so people don't think the class is easy. I would recommend taking another lab science just so you don't have her.",0
"Is confusing when he speaks. Seems to speak in code. Teaches the language like a science, he really likes to break apart every part of the sentence and ask questions about it. He calls on you to answer his questions even if you dont want to. I would avoid him if you have the choice. Kind of ruined my interest in the french language.",0
"Participate and do the homework. This is a language class, and Sensei Garrissi expects you to speak the language in the class.",1
She was the most inefficient prof ive ever had. She'll ask if she should switch between whiteboard/ projector/computer about 15 times every class and wont even listen when you answer her. She constantly asks if we have questions but then DOESNT EVEN LOOK UP TO SEE IF YOU RAISE YOUR HAND! She even goes through half a math prob and just stops,0
Dr. Kerrane is the best professor I've had at the University. He's also my advisor.  He will do anything he can to help students who are here to learn and get somewhere.  Take Kerrane if you get the chance and take him as often as possible.,1
"Knoop was difficult at best.  If you have a difficult time getting long with her it will be reflected in your grades.  She will even admit if she doesn't like you she's harder on you.  Following along in class is difficult, expect to run off topic at least three times a class. Her knowledge of the industry is dated at best.",0
"I was quite interested in this class prior to beginning, but about two weeks in I realized this professor takes forever to respond and expects you to already know quite a bit about computers(though this is actually a ""beginner"" class). I got a C, but she needs to communicate and clarify assignments better",0
"Dr. Burke was the most unaccommodating and unavailable prof I've ever had. She does not reply to emails AT ALL. I had to find emails for other people in the psych department to see if I could get in touch with anyone else regarding the issues I was experiencing. The course material is interesting, the delivery is not.",0
"The worse teacher ever, hard tests and tough grader, she just copy and paste her answers, and if you asked her a question she dont give you the right answer.",0
"EASY A, she spends most of her class just talking about her own life. she is super nice. we only did 2 speeches this semester that was extremely easy. she does require a cam, but get a cheap one or use a laptop cam. TAKE HER",1
Best BU Psych 101 professor,1
Ce professeur est passionnÃ© par sa matiÃ¨re. Il est trÃ¨s prÃ©sent pour les Ã©tudiants. Les attentes sont claires et les examens trÃ¨s justes.,1
"An amazing professor! Incredibly nice person and made class very interesting. Lots of homework though, and you have to work really hard to get an A on the papers and the midterms.",1
"""If you don't read EACH chapter THREE times before the test, you won't get above an 80."" He's not lying, his tests are extremely hard and you learn 20 chapters in 3 short months. Your saving grace will be the MindTap homeworks and the business plan. Really passionate marketing guy, really hard professor.",0
"I'm so glad I had Professor Lhota for my first semester of freshman year as she was honestly the best teacher I had during the semester. Super helpful, friendly and funny. Always willing to help and gives really good feedback on essays to help you get an A.",1
she expects too much from an online HISTORY class. like girl it's an 8 week course and you want us to put 4 sources in a discussion... bye. dont take her if u can help it,0
"Show up to class every day, and you'll 4.0. Read his textbook he wrote and writes exams directly out of, and you'll definitely 4.0. Go to his TA's exam review sessions where they literally give you answers to the tests, and it'll be pretty hard not to 4.0. Very easy class if you don't treat it like an easy class and skip or don't study.",1
"Yuck, he is a worst prof ever, never prepares for his class very unfriendly and always in rush! useless in his office hours! Math is not his job! you can always see his crack...",0
"Dr. Beattie is just a sweet old man. Attendance isn't necessary, but a good idea when an in-class quiz is coming up. There are only 5 of them and the class before he will give you a study guide in class. 10 hours in a classroom clinical is required, but enjoyable and easy. Bring him canned goods? Extra credit. Love this guy. ",1
"John Fu is a great teacher. His teaching style is a little boring, but he knows a lot about graphic design and is extremely valuable to students who are serious about a career in the field. Overall, wonderful guy, very passionate, and always willing to help. He'll surprise you! Will certainly take his classes again!",1
Plan to spend the time you would on two courses for one of hers.Perfection does seem to be her goal.Unrealistic and difficult to achieve when working in a graduate program and out in the field. Seems to purposely give vague directions for papers.Threatens students they will not pass due to the last paper w/o giving grades. Many rewrites over break.,0
"By far my favorite professor so far. Dr. Good is an extremely kind and intelligent man. He was very flexible with tests, papers, etc.",1
"his class kicked my butt, read the text and do the reviews and you will be ok!",0
"Taking his classes online was difficult. He schedules his exams during the most inconvenient time, OUTSIDE of the scheduled lecture time. He literally uploads videos of him reading a notes sheet as a lecture. The concepts are complicated & difficult and he is not very helpful when explaining them unless you ask a VERY specific question. Frustrating",0
Long chapters to read in a week's time yet quizzes have 10 questions over all the reading and there's review or a guide beforehand. Questions are also tricky. Does not give any lectures. Discussion participation is a must. This class made me feel incredibly jaded. There's no lectures or learning from the teacher it's just research and reading.,0
"Never responds to emails, tests are all essay and fill in the blank...very very hard...",0
"She is a great professor! Really funny and crass sometimes, but she knows a lot about the subject. The material was somewhat challenging, but in a good way. If you go to class and take the time to understand what's taught, you should be fine. They try to give you extra easy grades to help you",1
"Lots of reading but let me tell ya. Dr. Heth is my favorite professor ive ever had in my 4 years at Taylor. He is a man of God, he offers so much wisdom and knowledge, and he courageously follows the Lord even when others dont agree. Amazing feedback he really reads your papers and offers some helpful tips and acknowledges your successes.",1
"Dr. Schwartz relies on students doing homework instead of actual teaching to teach the course material.  Half the time, she's willing to help.  The other half, she just gets mad and lists what the class did wrong, offering no help.  YOU WILL NEED YOUR TEXTBOOK.  She's not the worst professor in the world, but she's worth taking an 8:00am to avoid.",0
"An awesome teacher. Hilarious and knowledgeable. Classes are definitely fun, but very hard work. Not a class to slack off in. He gives 110% in class and students definitely realize that, but student effort is definitely expected in return.",1
"Rude, unforgiving, does not participate in BB discussions",0
"Genuinely one of the worst professors I've ever had, and I let her know that on her evals, too. Very condescending and thinks the whole world revolves around her class. I had an emergency meeting that I was going to have to leave TEN minutes early for, and she got super huffy and did everything but cuss me out. Very unprofessional and rude.",0
Great professor.  Makes you do the work for yourself.,1
"Everyone in my class, including myself, didn't start the 12 page paper or group project until the last few weeks.  Make sure to start those EARLY and don't procrastinate because you will regret it.  The book was only used to do the chapter questions every week.  There was no tests in my class. I really liked him as a teacher he has a lot of stories",1
"If you go to him with a question, prepare to feel insulted, belittled, and still not have a clue whats going on.",0
"littlejohn sucks, she is not helpful at all, her lectures go by very quickly and are not related at all to the textbook, yet we get tested on the textbook, as well as the web design labs, its like 3 courses in one! with a crappy prof!",0
"Plan on attending class everyday. Says 1 thing one minute and changes her mind the next. Not clear about what she expects from you; even another Prof I talked to about her agreed. If you get put with a bad group for the semester, don't expect a good grade. No matter how hard you work she'll punish the whole group for it. Avoid taking her.",0
"His lectures were not the best, but he improved throughout the course. He gives lots of assignments but they are real world and helpful. GO TO OFFICE HOURS. went all the time, never have before. Always ready to meet for questions. Emails back fast. Will take 321 with him. ",1
"This is a one credit class on careers in environmental biology. It is really easy and you get to learn a lot about resumes and cover letters. Professor Hansen is a great teacher and helped me a lot with networking to find jobs. Overall, its an easy class with a lot of benefits.",1
Great Professor and very humble. Took him for the Summer 2 session and as long as you read then you will be fine for the quizzes. Quizzes are a pain but it forces you to read. He asked 4 questions on the quizzes and usually 1 hard one to separate the men from the boys. Take this guy if you can because I learned a lot from his class.,1
Not impressed st all,0
"Groza is a hit or miss. If you have prime interest in the subject, he'll convey the subject in his little nerdish manner. However, for me at least, the slides are extremely confusing and doesn't help when you can't stay awake in his class because you have no idea what's going on.",0
The only reason lecture is mandatory is because of participation points. Otherwise you could do it all from home. She posts all assignments online. There was only one in class assignment worth 50 points. Lecture is very scattered and hard to follow. She just gives a little outline of the reading assigned. She assigns weekly online quizzes,0
Les critÃ¨res de mme Pellerin ne sont pas trÃ¨s claires et il est difficile de savoir ce qu'elle veut. Elle connait trop bien sa matiÃ¨re et parle sans nous laisser apprendre (vu qu'elle connait trop le sujet). Il y a beaucoup de travaux dans la classes qui valent 5% alors qu'ils prennent beaucoup de temps.,0
"great teacher. loved the class all essays were self assigned and he is very helpful, clear and will work with you on all essays. after grading you essay  you have a chance to submit them for another grade. very easy laid back teacher. i would highly suggest for you to take to him.",1
"This class is hell because he is SOOO boring!!! The only scores you have are some quizes which are written out short essay questions and tests. No homework, but tests have more than one right answer you have to pick the one he thinks is the best. He is not good at explaining the material, you would do better just reading the book for yourself!!!",0
"Dr. Bartz is GREAT for AT lab. She has a ton of experience and is super nice! She's so caring and super fun to be around. This being said, I do not recommend her for an online class. The worksheets took easily 30 min if not more and were worth 1-2 points. Not very clear on instructions. Definitely take for lab, DO NOT take for online lecture.",0
"Professor Ulysses is by far the kindest professor I've had. Spanish 100 was so fun with her, and I actually learned a fair bit of Spanish. There are few assignments and those are clearly outlined. Ulysses is hilarious and makes class worth coming to. I hope I get her as a professor again!",1
Good prof. Knows what he is doing and gives the lectures well. But his voice made me sleepy :( I had to refer to the lecture recordings a lot to note down points I missed in class.,1
"this teacher is ughh, words can not explain! he has no syllabus and does not tell what book is needed for the course.he is late every single day and leaves before his students....i think he's getting ready to retire-get out while you can",0
"Ms. Laughlin is as helpful as an online instructor need be. I did this class in a short session and there were plenty of assignments each week to keep you busy (typically 2 or 3 worksheets from the textbook and a discussion board assignment). As long as you take the assignments seriously, you should have no problem earning an ""A"" in this course.",1
"unclear marking criteria, very slow and boring class. VERY picky when marking written assignments.",0
"Dr. Kim has a great personality with an accent to match. Neither of these assist in understanding the materials. Though the tests often covered more chapters than manageable (because she runs out of time), she is fair in grading. I earned a mid-C, but she graciously rounded me to a B due to constant attendance. She recognizes students who try!",0
"There are TWO readers, and together it is about 2,300 pages that you HAVE to read if you even wanna pass the essay portion of the exams which is 50% -_- this of course does not include the other 5-6 books he expects you to read in detail",1
"He loves to talk.  He doesn't seem like a hard test guy, but they can be.  He loves to make you learn a lot of lists for his tests.  Memorize all the lists and everything he tells you and you will do well.  Creates very comfortable atmosphere for students.",1
"Based on the emails and Blackboard posts, he struck me as one of those professors who took pride in failing students. The exams are nothing like the homework and review sheets; the prerecorded lectures don't prepare you for either exam or assignment. It felt effortless on his part and based on most reviews here, this has been a pattern for a while.",0
literally just so bad. This class is like watching paint dry.,0
"He's a superb person; intelligent too. He certainly is knowledgeable towards the subject. Although, he is extremely unclear about what he wants, and going to class isn't as beneficial as he believes. His lectures aren't too helpful with his assessments. His test questions are unclear too.",0
"An extremely difficult course because of subject matter, Formal Logic. Fits a lot of material into one semester. Textbook ESSENTIAL - assigned problems like a math class every night. Tests very difficult, but generous with partial credit for attempting the problem. Genius professor, but not always aware of students' struggle with material.",1
This class was ridiculous! I am a senior and a psychology major and this is by far the most difficult and boring class I have taken at UT. I highly recommend not taking this class!!!,0
Most boring Lecture I've ever had to attend. Usually goes on about nothing and when you ask questions you have to get it out of him. He doesn't tend to give you help straight up. Worst computer science teacher I've had,0
I think she's a very good teacher- i recommend her for prog. classes,1
Tom is so great. He tells you the real truth behind everything and anything. His lectures are hilarious and vary in length. Take him for com 150 because  it'll be the greatest experience ever.,1
"Lectures are unfocused on the topics, most likely will not answer your questions properly or answer an email. Grading is tough as he likes things done his way, part marks will not happen. Midterm and exam are the only things marked.",0
"You do labs and homework on webassign but she stated at final review ""Webassign accepts answers that I'd mark wrong because webassign allows for more error."" Wrong, she allows more error. She thinks you can find polynomial functions from basic graphs. You can't tell (x-3)^3 from (x-3)^7. She says otherwise. Out of ignorance she'll say (x-3)^3. Sad.",0
"This is a course that will test if you really want to be a bio major, pharm major, or pre-med major. It is a rigorous course that requires review and study every single day. The content is interesting and help is readily available between tutors, email, textbook, internet, and weekly review sessions. No hidden surprises, all clearly laid out.",1
"Horrible teacher, needs to defleat her ego",0
"Awesome teacher! Mr. Hogan's lessons were very informative, and he was very patient. I highly recommend his classes. He is an amazing guitarist!",1
"You wont regret taking him, you will learn a lot and he makes classes very enjoyable.",1
"Clearly very knowledgeable about his field, but he's just not good at passing that knowledge on to his students. Test averages for the class were always failing. Labs assignments were not well written, and it was hard to figure out what he actually wanted you to do.",0
amazing man! totally recommend!!,1
didn't care about student understand or not. many tests and didn't have time to ask he question.,0
"The easiest math class I've ever took, because he not really talk about the derivation of the formulas and theorems but specific practices. You can pass as long as take good notes and do the example questions. Exams is pretty easy, but there is only two midterms and ten questions each time, if you failed one you will failed the course. ",1
"She was great and really helpful. Sometimes the lectures were dull, but that was mainly because of the refusal for anyone in the class to participate.",1
"I took multiple course with her at the  third level and fourth including Roma history, Holocaust and German History. Write down everything she says make a chance to meet her and show her you're interested and you'll be fine. She is 100% reasonable if you approach her respectfully and once the formalities are over, she's great!",1
"Mike is my favorite prof so far at the UW. His grading is very lenient with re-submissions, which saved me in some instances. He is very helpful during office hours and on slack as well. This course content is difficult especially if you are new to coding, but with hard work a high score is possible.",1
"Knows her material well, expects you to as well. Rayor's classics courses aren't just read and repeat. When you read something in her class she wants you to read it, understand it, and then draw your own conclusions with that. Exams are hard, quizzes are hard, and papers aren't awful. Expect to have a lot of reading.",1
"Dr. Kimberling is a great teacher, organized lectures, predictable material on the tests, sticks to the syllabus.   She treats students like adults and expects them to be responsible.",1
"Terrrriibbbllleeee. Mad horrible, tasteless jokes that were funny only to himself. Spends very little time actually addressing the material and goes off in unrelated tangents. Apparently we were lucky this semester because he decided not to give us any hard assigments/essays.",0
"She is not helpful at all!  When you email about group assignments she basically says ""Good luck, hope you can work it out.""  Grades outside of the rubric.  Avoid her if you possibly can. ",0
"Worst professor Ive ever had in my entire life. He barely explains how to do the assignments, he reads the textbook to you in the most monotone voice youll ever hear and is very rude to his students. I have straight As in all my classes and studied for all tests and still received a bad grade in this course. Do NOT take any courses with him.",0
"First, he's not hot. He's average & has a small build. Moreover, I find him analytically lacking. He has decent elocution; he isn't monotonous but nothing he says is remotely intellectually striking. Boring because material was directly out of the text. He's VERY bureaucratic. Can't be late even if you have good reasons. Lacks compassion.",0
"3 exams 1 gets dropped, and a final, equal weight. No attendance grade no graded hw no textbook. 8-10 Q exams, gives VERY similar practice Qs. Handwriting/accent is tricky but he will always clarify when asked. He will teach/test you on CORE examples rather than trick you with much harder homework/test Qs. study the practice exams by heartA",1
"Can't speak to his history creds but this guy was terrible for a political science course. It's been year since I had the extreme displeasure of sitting through three unbearable weeks. I don't care about his political leanings, but not allowing students to meaningfully engage and not keeping class in order is a hard no for me.",0
Professor Worrall really cares about her students. The course work is fairly easy and allows a decent amount of creative freedom. Overall this was a fun (and not too stressful) class!,1
"As long as you attend class and read the textbook the course is not hard. Some days he will ramble but he always finds a way to bring the story back to the topic he is trying to emphasize. He doesn't use powerpoint so if you don't go to class the only way to catch up is with the textbook. Overall, he is nice and the class isn't hard to pass.",1
Workload is absurd. Was seemingly shocked that COVID19 affected students' abilities to complete assignments. Waited until April 12 to make course adjustments. Expects students to prioritize her class above all else but hasn't graded papers from week 3. Remember that English teacher in high school you couldn't stand? She's back and better than ever,0
"Professor Miller is definitely one-of-a-kind. She can come off as a bit rude sometimes, but caring at the same time which is a bit odd... there are a LOT of readings so be prepared. When classes moved online she was very understanding of the difficulties that came with at-home learning.",1
"It seems most people have given up on him. Class is 16/35 full, people keep dropping out, and in the online lectures you'd be lucky to find 9-10 people attending. That should tell you everything about him. Listen to these reviews people.",0
"Class average for exam was barley a C, gives no feed-back, expected to read everything he gives you, memorize everything maps, readings, power point slides, ****must go to every class. Would not recommend. I would rather watch paint dry than listen to the course material as it is extremely uninteresting. ",0
"Basically 6 speeches you need to make. Gives you the topic, you pick a subtopic, write about it then present on your day. Picks randomly on first day of presentation. One is a toast that is 2 minutes long. Never have to speak longer than 5 minutes. Recommend for majors who need to publicly speak.",1
"Seriously, to echo everybody else, never ever ever take. The cutoff for a B+ was an 87.  I got an 88 and he gave me a B because he told me he didn't think I deserved a B+.",0
"I liked him. Funny guy, sometimes gets distracted. You learn a lot, but at the end of the course you don't really feel like you've learned anything.",1
"Great prof, genuinely cares. However, expects a bit much for this course, which is required for ME students who don't need the depth of knowledge he expects. Daily quizzes are a bit much. Not usually easy questions & nobody has time to study that much to prep for them. Overall, expects too much for ME majors but excellent and helpful instructor.",1
"Mollie was super nice! Just take notes, show up to class and you're fine. She reviewed for tests and was very helpful!",1
The king of journalism. Ask about his annual trips to Cuba.,1
Helpful and approachable.  She has an enthusiastic teaching style and is willing to repeat herself if you ask.  Exams are tough and it seemed that the majority of the class would not finish them in the time given.  The class shrinks after the first one.  Put the effort in and you should be fine for the most part.,1
"A rude teacher! Of course if is good looking, which is nice...but I do not like the way he teaches and he has a problem with every comment or answer a student gives him-only HIS way seems to be the correct way",0
"Dr. Ranft is a great guy. However, refrain from taking his ethics class. Everything has a right or wrong answer whether or not your values are different. He loses assignments very frequently and is often late to class. His test are ridiculous and most material is from Google. If you have options, do NOT take his class!",0
Watts is one of the nicest teachers I've had. She's super flexible with due dates and really wants you to succeed. You have to write a good amount for the class but it's not difficult at all. I would  definitley take her for any English class.,1
"Awesome guy! Class is fun, exams aren't bad. This course really gives you a totally new perspective on race.",1
"Very nice guy, extremely smart... but his class was very difficult. Lecturing is not his strong suit. Found it hard to stay awake during his lectures.",1
"The professor is nice, response to emails fast, and the essays and discussion posts aren't too bad. What is worst is the exams in this class. The formatting is horrific with answer choices being extremely unclear. At the moment about 3/4 of the class has not gotten higher than 30% on the exams, and the only thing she said was to ""Study more"".",0
"SUPER disrespectful to students. Minimal office hours.  However, the plus points are that he is one of the better Stat 230 profs. His lectures are very clear and the examples that he uses often show up on midterms and finals.  You just have to deal with his rudeness sometimes.  Course notes are also good practice.",0
"Due to the pandemic and making no accommodations in teaching style or tests, this is the worst class I have ever taken at Missouri State. I would definitely recommend other professors for this class that were more accommodating and understanding due to the pandemic.",0
"Dan Chester was such an awful teacher that when I realized there were professors rated lower than him, I was forced to rate him to undo this gross injustice. His lectures were boring and worthless, and even he couldn't understand what he was trying to do half the time. Avoid if at all possible, if it is not possible, good luck.",0
Take him. I dare you. You will know why students get violent PTSD-induced flashbacks at the mention of his name - even if you pass.,0
Bad teacher the reason I say this is because he ignores your phone calls and emails and he gets an attitude when you ask a question he will not help you at all. Take at your own risk. I never even had a one on one meeting with him.,0
Franciosi is a genuinely nice guy and a fair grader. He knows a lot about the Holocaust. There's a lot of reading in his class and for every couple books there is a paper as well as a big research paper at the end of the year. He cares what students think and expects you to speak up. He even took my class on a field trip to Chicago for free.,1
"I don't find Chen hard to understand or in any way unclear. She has an accent.  Deal with it.  (Like most of you even speak a second language!) She is amazingly organized and she knows her stuff.  Most of all, she has really helped me improve my writing.  I would love to take her again.",1
"The hard thing about this class is that the tests are multiple choice, so you can do the whole problem correct and make a small mistake, and the answer will be wrong (?'s were 5 pts. each I think). So, make sure you do the homework and really understand the book material. The homework covered in class is the most helpful thing, so go to class!",1
"I did every homework, spent so much time on this class, followed her rules and never got an A. I don't recommend her",0
"One of the best professors I've ever had. He really lets it be known that he cares about how every single one of his students do in his class. He wants everyone to succeed and will help you with it. His office hours are a god send. He does give a lot of hw, but it's for a good reason. One of the kindest most caring professors I've ever had.",1
"So many thing wrong here, and not enough characters! He talks too fast, and quickly says names of certain essential terms leaving you no idea what he said. There are no written notes, and what he says contradicts the slides/books a lot. He frequently doesn't say things when he talks but then says he did. He tests from the MASSIVE book. Exams hard.",0
"Ms. Parker's class was interesting. Not an art fan. Even though this was an online class I still had a ""field trip"" to our local museum (did cost a fee). Which was pretty cool since I had never been. Very fair grader, made a ""B"" due to me not checking my blackboard after I submitted my last assignment. Easy ""A"" if you do the work.",1
Lisa cares deeply about what she teaches and it shows! You will care about it too after taking her class. She is very engaging and an easy grader. Be prepared for group work/discussions.,1
The prof and the TAs were great this semester and were really understanding during this hard time. The class was very well-organized and expectations were clear. She's very knowledgeable about what she teaches :),1
Tres long et ennuyeux,0
If you're thinking Thermo: always take Boyle. He is the best Thermo professor at umaine. If not: maybe have him as a back up.,1
"He knows what he is talking about, but I didn't learn any thing from him. To make sure I could pass the class I had a tutor,read the book, look at other professors on YouTube , and I went to lecture every class! He makes this class a lot harder then it should be.",0
It was an easy one credit class show up on time. Ask question participate if you can. She is VERY nice and tells stories that will make you laugh and think.Hand in the finial paper and you will get an A like I did.,1
"Mrs. Davis is the best math instructor ever! She is very caring and wants you to do your very best! She also offers extra credit, which not many math instructors do. In addition, I took this class online and did extremely well considering the fact that I usually do not do well in math. If I had a chance to take her again I would!",1
"She is a very nice and pretty easy teacher. She helps students understand the information, and she has good notes which she prints off for you!! As well as good examples.",1
"one of the worst classes I've taken. For an online class, it is all busy work. They're a multiple videos to watch that take up 1-2 hours a week. The quizzes are so specific to the videos and the questions on the quizzes/exams are all very challenging.",0
"Took this class as a junior and it is the hardest class I have taken so far. Way to hard for a 100 level course. Get ready to read because the readings are typically 25 pages long and there will be a quiz in class. Test's are based off his lectures. I would recommend writing every word he says in class, ya never know what will be on the tests.",0
"Great professor! He is a  little intimidating, but once you get comfortable you can get a lot from David and his class! He is helpful and lays out the assignments clearly. Very organized and quick to grade, plus he keeps his Moodle up to date! I really enjoy not having the stress of being tested, it makes it easier to take in what we are taught. ",1
I took her online for English 101. Professor Bailey was a great communicator and kept us all up to date on the upcoming assignments as well as reminders. She was responsive and gives full credit for the Journals and Discussions as long as you participate. 5 essays and 10 Journals on one novel. Great instructor!,1
"Extremely knowledgable about the material. Explains programs and concepts during lecture in some detail. Doesn't give breaks. Approachable during and office hours and after class for help, although somewhat condescending. For beginners to programming, his lectures may be hard to follow or understand, so go to other profs if you can. Decent overall.",0
He is such a boring guy. Just talks on and on never writes anything on the board. His tests are way more thorough then what he makes it out to be. Boring class somewhat easy,0
Has no business teaching! Very unorganized and wants his students to fail because he refuses to answer questions or emails. Spends all class ranting I haven't learnt anything this term. Worst professor at Glendon. Also arrogant and has serious women issues.,0
"Really Easy, takes a comparative literature approach. Just read the sparknotes of the assigned readings, show up to class and recitation and it is an easy A. 3 Tests and 2 small 1-2 page papers syllabus wise",1
"The labs take unreasonably long to do for only being 2% of your grade. Data and resources for labs were not given on time and there is no leeway/ extensions given ever, despite being told time & time again we are facing unprecedented times. The labs seem messily put together, had to consult many, many outside resources to get a good grade.",0
"Just repeat everything he says in class on the tests. He pushes his ideas on students and if you try to have your own opinions, he shames you. Dont take this class if youre bad at taking notes from what he says because he doesnt write anything and make sure to talk about racism or the rich oppressing the poor in every question or its wrong.",0
"Prof. B is such a sweet lady, but her class is without a doubt a challenge. She loves to engage with her students and is passionate about what she teaches. Papers are usually long but not difficult to write because the topics are usually very compelling. I didn't agree w/ some of her views on society but overall she is open to new perspectives.",1
very approachable. Helps understand material in depth. If asked gives you more stuff to think about. Great !!!,1
"had him as a visiting professor at Purchase and his class was easy! there was no hw and you could get by without reading the required textbook. all we had was 4 quizzes, a midterm (you were allowed 1 page of notes) and a final. lots of opportunities for extra credit. he's ideal to teach classes to non-majors/gen eds",1
"Very interesting class. Dr.B knows her stuff very well. She is willing to help students whenever they need it. Her tests are very fair and if you study your notes for a few hours before a test, you should be just fine. One of the nicest professors I have had and its a very interesting class. Highly recommend you taking this class!!!",1
"Do not take this class. Bashevkin practically snakes her students by raising the class average super high during the term and dropping it largely during the exam to average the class out. I felt blindsided. Went from an A to almost a B- after the final exam, which she marked extremely hard.",0
"I would not say this is a easy class but she is a really amazing teacher, who makes this course interesting. She is really passionate about her lecture. Weekly online hw and quiz, which is fine, but stms take you a long time to prepare before that---read the book.... In short, she really wants her students do well n I encourage to choose her!",1
She knows her accent can be hard to understand. A good sense of humour,1
"This is one of the worst professors I've ever had. I think he's a nice person, but as a professor he is very mean. He basically wants his students to fail and you have to study very hard to get a good grade. I am usually and A student and I am hoping to get a B in this class if I'm lucky.",0
"He's funny.. that's about all the positives I can give. He goes on and on about a subject and then says ""But that won't be on the test"", so basically he wastes like 20 minutes on a single subject that won't even be on the test. His lectures are sloppy and unorganized, and if you ask a question he probably won't understand what you're asking.",0
"SHE IS A CRAZY PROFESSOR, SHE THINK THAT  THE STUDENTS DOES NOT WORK SHE GIVES A LOT WORK TO DOING FOR EXAMPLE  TWO PAPER PER WEEK, PLEASE STUDENTS DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS IF DONT WANT BECOME A CRAZY STUDENT",0
"Great professor -- reasonable exams, good clarity, and funny.",1
"While some of the stuff he talks about is interesting and you can tell hes really into his ""stuff"". DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR. He cannot teach. His explanations and examples jump from one end to the other.",0
Everyone seems to give her a bad rap for her teaching. She is a great teacher and you will certainly learn your stuff. She gets a bad rap because people are lazy and dont want to work hard. Lab is tough but extra credit and curves make up for it. Best advice I can give you is make friends fast and study with them. Class is very doable,1
Instructor Hebert is a very fair instructor. His course is very well put together. He knows his stuff and clearly explains everything. He makes the class worth taking.,1
His tests are aweful. He likes to screw people over. There is no need for a premed physics to be that hard. He will make your life suck. Switch to straight bio or biochem and take another physics. SERIOUSLY. Atleast 5 pre med kids drop out every year and they are good students.,0
"Professor Stevens was very sweet and is very passionate about english. She clearly wants everyone to listen to her lectures and succeed. The main problem I had with this class is she is not very organized and would say one thing then the complete opposite 5 minutes later. Though, this class is fairly easy.",1
"Definitely demands quite a bit of his students -- easily 50+ pages of reading per class, on average. Has a certain amount of contempt for tech students, doesn't believe we know how to analyze and communicate.",1
"Decent professor, not too hard but not extremely easy. I liked the way she taught, but the department had control of what was on the test. Stupid, but still did well.",1
"She is a wonderful teacher and spirit. It is SDV so most of it is common sense or just simple things to remember. Her class is def. not necessary to take any longer than 8 weeks. Overall I recommend her, she was very easy and simple. Also if class was an hour, she would be done way before the hour ended which I liked because she didn't waste time.",1
Less then a week until the midterm and we have NO assignments marked.  Makes it difficult to study.  We are using a new text book so she is not will to make up/give a practise midterm :(,0
"Easily the best CSI professor I've had. Exams contain no surprises, lectures are engaging, and professor is cheerful and clear (also emails back very quickly for assignment questions!). Attend class, pay attention to everything, and do your assignments, and you'll do well. I loved this class, but would take any course if taught by Ms Boyd!",1
"If you want to learn physics take this class, but if your aim is to pass anyhow and by any means, he is not your type. Physics is difficult but you can learn by asking questions. Answers e-mail promptly. Lots of HW but is scaled at the end of the semester.",1
"He always tells pointless stories and thinks he is absolutely hilarious.  Very boring class, just powerpoint based. Little interest in communications after taking this class. Avoid if possible",0
He was the highlight of my freshman year! He is encouraging and always lets you know what you should study in order to succeed in his class. He is funny yet is serious about his love of genetics. Respect this class and he will respect you!,1
Nice man but he is not much of a teacher.,0
I had him for an interim class and it was awesome! I would definitely have taken him for a semester class if i had the opportunity.,1
"Dr.Shin is really nice, he does have a heavy accent, but it is easy to understand if you're actually listening and not spacing off. He likes for his students to ask questions and to actually learn. He is very nice and highly intelligent. Give him a chance, don't let the heavy accent turn you away, he's a great PhD.",1
"BEST PROF EVER! Best Prof of UW... Gives Amazing lectures!! Very helpful, open minded!Marks well, you get what you deserve!",1
"His online class is mediocre at best. Every 2 weeks you read two books, write a large paper, and answer 36 discussion questions. All his lectures are recorded and offer no semblance of help either to the discussion or the papers. He's also a unclear grader and doesn't offer constructive criticism for his grades. Do not take this class online.",0
"Told myself every day that I didn't need to go to class, but I still did. Honestly, the easiest class ever. Four exams, including the final, all multiple choice. Lecture before each exam, he gave us a short list of vocab to memorize and we could all ace it. One paper, pretty long, but not too hard if you just get it done. Definitely take him.",1
This is Prof. Wagner's first time teaching this class in a decade. Many of the people in my class switched out after the first week. He barely goes over the material that's on the assignments and quizzes. Otherwise hes generally interesting and comical. His math digressions are irrelevant yet fascinating.,0
Do the culture of London program with him!,1
"Super enseignante, elle est drole et intÃ©ressante. Par contre, elle ne permet pas les notes par ordinateur et passe rapidement les slides. Au moins, tout l'information se trouve dans son livre. J'ai apprÃ©ciÃ© mon cours avec elle c'est certain.",0
"I adore him. He's kind, helpful, genuine, and wears funky colored glasses. If you go to class, speak up, and do the work that is assigned, you'll be fine. He obviously love what he does and makes his classes interesting. If you're interested in English Lit, you will get along just fine.",1
A really great prof.,1
"Her lectures were long, confusing, and did not connect to the tests at all. Tests are hard and almost impossible to pass. She did nothing to improve students understanding, I do NOT recommend.",0
"Amazing prof! She explains the concepts well and she keeps you focused. Her PWPs can be dry but she gets you through it by telling interesting stories. If you pay attention, known the vocab you will do well.",1
"He was an amazing teacher. If you had questions he had a detailed answer and makes sure you understand the topic. If you listen and do your work he respects you. If you slack off and don't do the readings then he will lecture about laziness. Otherwise, he really improved my writing skills!",1
"Harkins knows what he is talking about. This was about his 70th semester or something close to it. He gives a lot of homework, and won't except it late (unless you use the one-time pass). There was only one test, the final, but there was three essays. He takes attendance every day, and will take points off. But, he is always willing to help you out",1
"He's one of the best professors I've had. Gives great feedback, does his best to understand the students point of view and is a good lecturer. Highly focused on lecture material so attending classes is super necessary to do well",1
This man deserves an honorary doctorate. He knows more about literature than most profs and he enjoys sharing it. Too bad he's overloaded with extra classes most semesters. Aquinas is lucky to have him and would be sorry to lose him.,1
The most enthusiastic teacher I've had.  Tony is very knowledgeable and experienced in the field of finance yet not afraid to tell you he doesn't have all the answers.  He teaches in an understandable language by relating concepts to everyday scenarios.  He was one of my favorite professors.,1
"DULL- Talks like a kindergarten teacher... talks about different learning styles, but uses lecture.",0
"Best engineering professor I've had so far. Doesn't require students to attend lectures, but attending them are the easiest way to succeed. Also goes above and beyond for his students with extra tutorial sessions and extra help in general. Kind of a difficult marker on exams.",1
Willingham is amazing. The class is easier if you have a bit of a background in psych and you are interested in the material -- otherwise the tests can be tough. There are only 3 grades (including the final) so you need to be good at multiple choice tests to do well.,1
I did not enjoy this class. The lectures did not have to do with the tests and class dragged on for hours it seemed.,0
He is so rude. He yells and slams his hands on the table if you don't understand the material. His test suck and his study guides are horrible. Do not take his class.,0
Professor Koskela's class discussions are clear and full of information. He uses the books to lead the class lectures. The reading is very interesting and he has a clear understanding of the goals student's should focus on. He was an amazing professor and I loved the class. Would definitely take another class with professor Koskela. Learned so much,1
The instructor was out of touch with how online students work and did not provide clear guidance as to what was required and when it was required. There was a lack of responsiveness to issues and a tendency to blame his insufficiency and lack of communication on the students.,0
A nice professor! She cares a lot about the class and helping us prepare for college writing.,1
"Interesting topic, monotone teacher.",0
"AVOID if possible. Unfulfilling, difficult.  Lectures are a complete waste of time; he just reads from the PPTs, which are posted online. Don't go to class. Scrutinize the text and reference the PPTs to ensure you learned about the topics presented. He expects a total understanding of the text. Grade  4 exams (very hard) + 15 hw quizzes (easy)",0
"Map quizzes every wed and regular quizzes every fri. She's an awesome teacher she gives you the quizzes you just have to find the answers in the book, map quizzes if your good at remembering things really well then your do fine if your not might be a little bit difficult.",1
She is so awsome with upper division. I would definently say to take her. Especially if you can get her to talk about the prophets she gets really excited she loves them. It was my favorite day of class,1
Dr. Dan is such a sweet guy. His lectures were great and his class is real easy if you stay on top of assignments (there aren't many) and study for exams (study guide is provided w/ questions that will be on the test). Not only is it an easy A but you learn a lot.,1
"Make sure to buy the book, as the tests are comprised mostly of the key terms from the chapters. His lectures are hilarious. He's a super cool dude, would definitely recommend him. The grade is based solely on the 3 exams, so make sure to attend class and study. Look over your notes and study the key terms, and you should do well :)",1
"Worst professor ever. I've struggled with math my whole life and she didn't make things any easier. Students were always correcting her work, she rushes through her lectures. There's 4 homework quizzes worth 8 points and 4 tests worth 100 points, no extra credit and she does assign a few random worksheets only worth 1-2 points. Wack grading system.",0
"Very Friendly teacher, takes as much extra credit as you need which is really nice, defintely read the book to pass the quizzes and tests. Pay attention to any news or current events he talks about. Talks a ton about sports and shows lots of maps. Very good/fun teacher overall!",1
"goyne is a little difficult to follow as his thoghts are everywhere and pretty fast paced, but he is a very willing man to help anyone, he makes time and sets up alot of study sessions for people who want good gardes can make it possible.",1
do not recommend her to anybody,0
HST208 is worth taking for any major!Prof Crouthamel is very knowledgeable and encourages group discussion. This class requires participation and well-written papers (5) throughout the semester (no exams).He is always willing to help with papers. He also wants to get to know his students. The topics discussed are interesting and thought-provoking.,1
He's really helpful and an awsome teacher! The class was really interesting and I looked forward to it!,1
This class and professor are terrible. This man thinks he is so cool and he isnt. He apparently has no friends bc he hangs out with his students. LOSER! Avoid taking this class. All he does is ramble from the notes.,0
"Dr. Huss is a very passionate teacher, he cares a lot about psychology and cares a lot about his students. However, this is a very hard intro class. This class was very difficult, and goes over a lot of information. He is a great guy, but I would pass on taking this class.",1
"Attendance was optional for my class, and I opted out. This means I can't speak much for her teaching style. The material was not difficult for me, but many struggled. She gives many extra credit opportunities and her tests were always reasonable. Her homework method was tedious, but it saves you $200 on some AcctLabPlus access code. Lots of HW.",1
"This teacher is HORRIBLE. The material is useless impossible to understand. DONT TAKE THIS CLASS. Unless you can read the professor's mind, you will not be able to do well in this course.",0
"Multiple choice tests,no partial credit, 20, 8-16 problem hw. Studying midterm for final is futile. doesn't matter how much material you can shove into a both sided cheat sheet You are screwed. Got tutored, did all the extra credit, showed up every class ON TIME, took notes still failed, Pass is possible if taking teacher twice.",0
"Best chemistry professor at UMD. He can seem condescending in office hours but it's bc he doesn't re-teach you anything, he makes you figure it out which can feel stressful. He follows the textbook but I never opened the textbook and got an A. Just know everything in lecture very well and do all practice problems over and over and check w/ him.",1
He's smart but he is too intense when he is in his lectures. He doesn't care that you have other classes and assignments because he only gives you mon - fri to do a long and hard assignment. I have not had one assignment that was interesting. Nice guy but makes me regret going towards my major in english since he has taught me nothing at all.,0
Best overall professor at the University of Delaware. Very helpful and loves to teach.,1
"Would often make you stay hours after class for a critique that wasn't very useful, or wouldn't have time to give one at all.  Provided lots of examples and books that were helpful to look at. Her instructions on assignments weren't clear half of the time, and she docks points if you don't participate in class discussions/critiques everyday.",0
"Absolutely horrible. Worst Eco 146 Professor. AVOID THIS WOMAN. She is harsh, mean, rude, and unkind. Tests are moderately difficult, but in general she is awful!! I would rather gouge out my eyes then listen to another one of her lectures.",0
I referred to this website before enrolling in this class and everyone said he was difficult and not to take it. I thought a little challenge wouldn't be so bad and enrolled in the class anyway. It's not challenging in the sense that the material is hard. It is challenging in the sense that you have no idea what TF is going on so you won't pass.,0
Super nice professor. Recommend attending class as he gives tips all the time. He's really enthusiastic about the material and tells great jokes.,1
Attended 3 weeks of lecture and then resorted to the homework website to learn everything. Reads out of the book and is very hard to follow. I took this class online and his hand writing was unreadable.,0
"Professora AlemaÃ±y is hilarious and caring as well as willing to explain things. However, if you stop caring about your work, she'll be less likely to help you or go the extra mile. Show up, do the homework and STUDY. If she's sees that you're trying, she'll really go above and beyond. Don't expect her to give you easy A's though.",1
"I'll never take another class with him again. Frequently late to class, then he takes up to five minutes to get ready to teach. Worse, most of what he lectures on isn't on the test, and too much of what's on the test are things he either didn't mention or glossed over in class.",0
"She is not a good supervisor. She is not so knowledgable in the field but expects you to do advanced research. When you do your research job by yourself, she interferes and complains about many things. Although some of these things are not bad, in total it bothers a lot. She is more of an investigator and auditor than an inspirational supervisor.",0
"I have only been in his class for a couple of days, but what made me automatically not like him is that he said he will not record his lectures. I find this very inconsiderate, especially considering the time we are living in. If you won't make your classes accessible, especially when everyone around us is dying, then you are not a good person.",0
"Im a returning student, already have a diploma in electronics, so i know the subject matter.    nice guy, bad prof.   teaches the BARE minimum, then puts very complex stuff on the test.   also MUN has wrecked this course by making it 1 course with 2 ""modules"" circuits and TLE.  TLE is a pointless course, with more work than all my my other courses",0
"Karen Bishop is a rare find! She is an amazing person, and a great teacher. If you are not scared off by having to do a moderately high amount of work TAKE THIS TEACHER! She has become someone I consider a friend, a mentor, a motivator, and she can relate as a person. If you like the idea of sociology, she is the onlyteace to take it with!",1
"Really great technically, not so good conceptually.  Wonderful person and really cares about the students/department.  She also has a lot of connections to the outside printmaking world.",1
"Do not waste your time taking this course with him. He is a very nice man, but whenever you ask for help, he just tells you to read the book again. The lectures aren't even his work, homework only gives you 2 attempts per question and doesn't even show you the correct answers to fix your work or how they got that answer. Do not take him.",0
Gives good feedback on papers - but grades so toughly it's difficult to do well. Be sure to incorporate the strategies from the readings into assignments or you'll do poorly.,0
He is a brilliant astronomer but is terrible at teaching it to beginning students. This is an intro class and he spoke to us as if we are in a 400 level class. His class is so broad and his test have such specific questions. They are IMPOSSIBLE to study for. He does 100 multiple choice question tests. I failed all of them. Most people feel the same,0
"Duplass is the man who's going to make you decide whether or not teaching is right for you. As much as I hated how condescending he could be, I definitely learned a lot from him. I suggest you have a nice moment before you decide to take this class and ask yourself if you really want to be a social studies teacher - just a heads up.",0
If you choose one class to stay on top of make it 4P10.  Its all math do drill the practice probs as much as you can.,0
"Very interesting class, she is very nice and helpful. You will be bored by the material but love her stories.",1
"Too many pointless, time and paper wasting assignments. Boring class which is only offered for 2 hrs and 45 min",0
He is a really nice guy and wants his students to do well. This class has A LOT of reading involved but other than that not too much writing involved as long as you read and pay attentionparticipate its not too bad. ,1
"Frank is an excellent Prof. This was my first CSE course at York and I enjoyed this course a lot. Lab/written exams are fair. Final was very difficult. If you study this course, you can manage a B/B+.",1
"Professor Cain is a very nice guy... His lectures are just so boring, it was hard to attend (since participation doesn't matter). Exams are tough, C- average I'd say but he's a curver! Not as terrible as I was expecting... and I'm one of those people who don't study until 2 days before the exam.",0
Shiba is the sweetest teacher. She is so helpful and kind. Her class is awesome!,1
"Worse prof I've had so far in my university experience. Tough grader, doesn't explain anything related to the assignments in class and relies on ""general"" knowledge. Assignments are ridiculous and don't make any sense. Even the lab/tut instructor is speechless at times. Avoid at all possibility!",0
Freaking hard and alot of reading but he will work with you and his grading scale is low so you cant fail but it will be hard to make an a,0
"Awesome teacher, she is really helpful and makes it easy for you to pass.",1
Debra was a great possessor who certainly cared about her students. She is honest and funny too. If you're struggling definitely reach out because she will help you no questions asked.,1
"I've never taken a more difficult class. She expects way too much, and she can be fairly mean, so don't mess up.",0
"Sean is a really cool guy. I don't quite know what the other reviewers mean by him being such a harsh grader. If you do what the assignment says to do, there are no surprises and he grades completely fairly - no surprises. Gave me an interest for web development where there wasn't one before.",1
"Two papers and a midterm... Her grading is very strict, but she is also very willing to help before you turn in your papers. I would definitely recommend her, as she pushes and challenges you in a positive way!",1
"I loved taking class with Dr. Santos. She always has a great attitude and lets class be really discussion driven. She gives out small writing assignments all semester, and only has 1 long term paper. Her final is making a movie trailer, which is super fun! I would take this class again just for fun!",1
One of the worst Professors I've had here at UD.  Rude & Obnoxious.  Usually a quick exam taker but took the full time for all 3 exams.  Most likely will still end up with a B+ or A- but try to avoid her at all costs.  ,0
"Little bit of a tough grader, but he's a great guy and I would definitely go get a beer with him.",1
hes amasein,1
"Dr. D is definitely a solid choice when it comes to Briggs math. Yeah, the class can be difficult, but he wants you to really learn calculus. He can make some dry ass jokes during lecture but lowkey it's pretty entertaining. I really wish he could teach all of my math classes.",1
"Don't take his online classes if they have the MindTap ecourse book. Some of the tests are built into the book, some are built into the course site. I just spent 10 minutes looking for a ""test 2"" after taking ""exam 2"" thinking that the two were different and the test was somewhere hidden in the book. I like him, just not the setup of his class.",0
"Care about your GPA? Don't take professor Haidar's class. He grades awfully, it is his way or the highway. There were many occasions where I or my peers would get a correct answer and show work, but he didn't like it, so he marked it wrong. He knows the material, just doesn't know how to teach or communicate concepts to the students.",0
"It was bio lab class, with a quiz in the beginning of every lecture. She gives a review before every practical because she genuinely wants all of us to do well and pass. However, not all of us do well, so she tries to make it easier for us next time. She's great but it may be hard to understand her sometimes.",1
"Sister Howell is nice, but a bad teacher.  Everyone in the class is on their phones/bored to death because she just reads from the powerpoints.  For a 2 credit elective, this required way too much work.  Homework wasn't bad, but expect her to grade very specific/harsh on random things.  Tests were longer/more intense then necessary.  ",0
"Super laid back, but gives amazing feedback on the work you do. I love that if you dont do well on an assignment, he gives you feedback and a chance to fix your work. It really helps you truly understand the content and become a better student.",1
"If you get involved with the Honors Program, you are bound to have him. He is absolutely amazing, willing to work with students, funny, caring, and a GREAT educator. I had him for an honors history course (history is NOT my strong suite and I can never remember things right), he made this class FUN and lectures are actually good. Keep up on work",1
"Shes an amazing professor. Therere 3 essays , a midterm and final , but they are fairly easy. She takes attendance daily and starts off by asking everyone to answer the roll call question. Her class is easy and manageable. I would really recommend her class and her as a teacher if you are a Child Development major.",1
"I usually write these reviews knowing that the prof will read them, and I assume they'll know who's talking smack about them, just to keep me from saying exactly how much I disliked his class. I showed up late every day, so he didn't like me, that's fine, I'm used to that, but even still, beyond that, it was miserable.",0
"The class is an intellectual joke. Take home exams and everybody cheats. If you want to ""get over"" this is the class for you. but it really is an insult to college.",0
Does not teach. Just rants about OS's he does not like. ,0
The course required a textbook and was mostly based off the textbook and notes given during class. It required a lot of reading. Sometimes the class would feel more like a history lesson then english. Make sure you attend class as she does not use D2L.,1
Best teacher at UNCC easy A,1
"Students like him because he's an easy grader. His ""holier than thou"" attitude is unbearable, his humor is very dry. Funny how he thinks he understands what he is teaching when he ran for local office twice and didn't win either time lol. Take the class if you want an easy A but if you want to learn something, don't bother.",0
Great and helpful professor. Classes were interesting and enjoyable.,1
"Do not take her! She is completely unorganized she lost several of my assignments. She gives way too much homework and most of the time doesn't even collect it all because she has ""too much to grade"". The entire class is spent going over the homework. Get ready to teach yourself. Also, her attitude is very poor. She is rude and passive agressive",0
"This man is a genus.    Brilliant, witty, and fun professor.",1
"10 Quizzes. 5 tests. Given 2 opportunities at both. NEED TO READ AND TAKE A LOT OF NOTES. Answers cannot be found directly in text. It is a lot of interpretation. No answers can be found online, so you really need to know your stuff. I put in a lot of work for this class, and even though I'm not going to finish where I want, I actually learned.",1
Going to lecture will literally make calc 3 more confusing.  Worst professor I have had at Kettering so far. Will NEVER take again for any class. ,0
"He glosses over a lot of basics, but he's happy to explain if you ask.  He tries to keep lectures down to the bare minimum, so definitely ask for more explanation if you need it.  He is extremely clear about what he expects to see 'show your work' wise on tests and quizzes, and he isn't too nit picky.",1
Spread the word! This class must be taken down...take global chem or physical universe..whatever you do stay away from astronomy-stars with otway!,0
AWESOME!  Taught me I could perfom.. who knew?,1
"Is this a joke?? Will we actually do ANYTHING this semester?? Am I really spending $30,000+ to do Yoga exercises? It's amazing my brain hasn't atrophied yet.",0
HOT!!!,1
"Lectures notes are very messy, he's indirect when answering questions, exams are too long, he solves problems on the board extremely fast, goes over unnecessarily complex problems that will never be on exams which takes time away from solidifying/ the understanding of course topics,  should I go on? I hope you like weekend hw due dates :)",0
"Great feedback, I'd look forward to reading what he wrote on my papers. Always honest and helpful with his feedback. Great lectures, he has a comprehensive view of the US. If you want to open your mind, then really listen to his lectures and think about them hard. I very much respect this man and the work he's done.",1
"Had her for fantasy. Really poor public speaking skills, stumbles and reads over her lecture notes. Very boring lectures, difficult to attend. Marks relatively easy, not hard to get a decent mark if you can sit through it all.",0
"This is in no way a level 101 class, Kelley's exams are nearly impossible. She puts material on them that is nowhere to be found on her lecture slides and just expects you to know it. If you're not a geology major stay away and do your gen eds elsewhere",0
"He may be an amazing teacher IN THE CLASSROOM. But as an online teacher? He needs a lot of work. He doesnt do anything to help his students, just gives the lectures and the notes and you dont hear from him until a week before the exam. I pay to be taught, and understand. Not teach myself these concepts. The worst teacher I have ever had.",0
"He is extremely old fashioned but also very thorough with presentations and papers. You'll learn a lot. However, if I were to take this class again I'd 100% take it from someone else. Some of his grading is a complete joke. I feel like if he decides your a B student, you'll be a B student for every paper/assignment. Very nice guy though.",0
She is the worst professor at MCC. Do NOT take her!,0
"If you go to class, read the textbook and do a decent job on the 2500 word assignment you can get an A.  I thought he marked the assignment a bit tough, but the multiple choice questions on tests are very easy, as long as you went to class and did your reading.",1
Good Math Prof. Works through problems and explains things very well. Devoted to helping students. He even reviews in lecture before every test. Wish I could have him for M132!,1
"The only thing Munzer is worse at then teaching is grading.  If your a 1L unlucky enough to be put in his section, don't bother studying.  His tests are more random then his choice of polo shirt.",0
not good.,0
"Not a real class, but he is a great guy. Took a personal interest in everyone in the room. Thinks outside the box.",1
"If you struggle with math in the slightest please do NOT take this man! He is extremely rude to his students. Tells students that he doesn't care how they do, that he already has his tenure. He also uses profanity and cusses during class. Pop quizzes every single class. STAY AWAY FROM HIM!",0
"This prof is smart, but he has no idea how to teach.  He needs to take some lessons from John Mathews at Cal State Fullerton.  The textbook for this class has to be one of the worst I've ever had.  It has zero examples and doesn't explain things well at all. The professor's notes are lame.  Don't take this class if you value your GPA.",0
Nice prof but hard tests,1
"Avoid at all costs. This professor is a paria in the science community and he is kinda proud of it. He wants you to buy his expensive ebook, which dosen't work on more than one machine. Don't get screwed.",0
"I had Professor Bushey for CHEM131 and he was fine, however having him for 132 was hell. He is not good at explaining material, and often moves wayyy too fast. He got some of his own answers wrong and made the learning catalytics very stressful and due at the very beginning of class, but would get you the code minutes before. Not taking him again.",0
"The course is average at best. Probably easier than most other electives/ gen ed classes, but it is nothing to get jazzed up about. With the class being so large, Paul doesn't make a real effort to form a relationship with the class. He was barely there at the beginning of the semester, and he didn't seem all there when he did show up.",1
"Lectures are very boring. Dont bother printing out the powerpoints because he changes them and you get lost with the disorganization of them. Hes not very nice & gets off subject too much. Easy chapter quizzes/map quizzes. Dont buy the book, do the other assignments, and do the video project to pass. The project is ridiculous. Tests are hard.",0
"One of the best professors Ive had. I had her at Epcc and loved every class. Shes compassionate and caring, willing to work with you. Not a stressful class. She knows how to laugh, isnt tough like a lot of other professors.",1
"He is hard to listen to sometimes, but he will randomly call your name out for no reason. He does make stuff really confusing sometimes, but if you look over the power points he posts online, you will pass the class. Pay attention to what he is saying, no matter how hard it is. He doesn't really give in-class assignments.",0
You will have to self teach and she shows NO mercy. Dont take unless you can afford an F. Worst experience ever. You shouldnt be a teacher if you dont care about your students.,0
Gives good lectures and is always on point. Good with explaining and keeps it simple.,1
"Expect weekly assignments, but do not expect any feedback.  In class, you can expect a model but not much else in terms of helpful instruction.  Criteria for getting an A are hazy, but involve somehow exceeding his expectations (which would be--by definition--meeting his expectations for an A).",0
"Fowler's class was super interesting and he has an amazing background for what he teaches, but I was completely lost on what exactly I was being graded on throughout the semester. Organzation-wise, the class is a mess, but if you follow what he assigns you should be fine.",1
"Kurt is the most confusing professor I have ever had, however he literally lays your entire tests out for you. If you are comfortable with being given the exact ideas on tests including math problems and teaching yourself all of it then take him. It's an easy A only if you attend lecture and write down exactly what he tells you.",0
I PROMISE THIS IS THE EASIEST A YOU WILL TAKE. Tests are on lockdown but you literally will get A's on every single one because they're word for word from the pre-quizzes. Attendance is not mandatory ever which is good because I attended the lectures at the beginning of the semester and they're a total waste of time.,1
"Currently in her class during the coronavirus. Although some teachers lighten up on homework during this pandemic, she doubled it for us. I know we have a lot of time on our hands, but an eight hundred points essay and a thousand points essay are too much on us students who is stressed about the times going on outside of the world and in their home",0
"Dr. Pitelka is pretty good. Moves fast but is always open to questions and discussions. I found her tests and papers pretty easy. If you show up, listen, and skim the book, you'll be fine.",1
Make sure you read the book. If you just study the notes you will not do well on the tests. Attendance is required but I love hearing her talk. She's so funny and has a great time teaching the class.,1
"A good teacher, but more importantly a nice, understanding man!! Take him!",1
"mcgettigan was really not good at all. P/NC'ed her class (took it for no reason, didn't get any core credit & not a film major). tests had super tricky questions. not willing to work w/ you during office hours, surprisingly stern for how ""cute"" she comes off in class. she's very unhelpful & can even be rude about how poor of a student you are.",0
"Walkers pretty ease.  Don?t be a smart ass.  Tell him how much you love football and Pennsylvania, and try in all of you work.  You are guaranteed at the very least a B.  He SUCKS as an advisor though!!!",0
"Hands down, one of the best instructors I have had the pleasure to take a class from. He is passionate, funny, incredibly knowledgeable, and genuinely enthusiastic about the success of his students. There's a fair amount of writing in the course, but Jonathan provides ample support. If you take advantage of the help he provides, you will do well!",1
"I really enjoyed being in his online summer course. He let me retake an exam, gave extra credit on assignments when more than asked was requested. Textbook was verry cheap too! I would def recommend him! ^.^",1
She is a hard grader and gives a lot of work.,0
"Nice lady, very helpful, and very easy to work with. Course consists of a midterm letter, a presentation, and a 20 page final(double spaced with pics and sources). She really likes to see ALOT of research, but doesnt expect you to write a novel(writing for engineers). Id definately take her again.",1
"Pretty easy class if you know what you're doing. Explains the assignments the day of, step by step, so it's hard to get a bad mark. Grading criteria is confusing on the final assignment, as there is no real rubric. Takes a lot of time for each assignment but he gives you a lot of lab time and it is due at midnight. Overall, an easy A.",1
"Take her for a hybrid, and do the discussion boards. Tests are hard, but with her grading system you can still get an A.",1
"For 098 she expects you to already know the math and teaches it like review. I like her, but she is tough as a teacher. Especially if you don't already understand the material. She explains things in a circular way that isn't very clarifying. ",0
"GO TO CLASS, and read the book. He says the information on the board is the information on the test, but he also throws in information from book. Test questions range from simple vocab definitions to in-depth movement of a graph. Attend class and read book",0
Wish I learned more in this class.,0
Prof Mason met with us individually at the beginning of the semester and really took the time to get to know us and where everyone served their mission and stuff. Topics of the class were really varied between culture and politics. The textbook is really boring and so are some of the readings but the class is interesting and really easy/engaging,1
He's a nice guy but doesn't teach. Just hands out packets during class so you basically have to teach yourself the material.,0
"Good Prof, very helpful, cares about students, lots of examples. I would take him Again.",1
He was not clear on grading and did not understand what he was teaching most of the time. He would ask the class if he was doing a problem right and sometimes end up teaching us the wrong methods so come test time--when he knew how to do it--he would grade it using the correct method and our grades would tank. Would not recommend.,0
"She might as well read the textbook to you. She takes the book, and puts it on powerpoint, reads it to you..and expects you to memorize every word. She gives a lot of extra credit, but its not really worth it because of the way she adds it in. I bring my computer to class, and go on it all class (what im doing now!) Don't expect to learn anything!",0
"If you like misogyny, you'll love Lentz. He soured me on the English department as a whole and on English as a subject. He should have retired years ago and been a Civil War historian instead.",0
She only replies to simple email request; she does not reply to in-depth email inquiries.,0
"Interesting man, interesting plays to read, a little off beat, but you'll learn a lot.  Go to class and pay attention, the papers are easy, and graded easily, and random quizes just to see if u read or went to class.  You'll love Dawes!!",1
"He is such a fantastic professor! While he is a difficult grader, the class discussions are extremely informative and enjoyable. I would definitely take again!",1
"Thomas's class was challenging at points, but overall very manageable. Though she doesn't always collect homework, you need to do it to stay up to speed. Her lectures were sometimes vague, but the book helped. Sometimes she would blow you off if you asked a question in class, but she helps when meeting one on one. Would take her again if needed.",1
There is a ton of work every week.  Took this class hoping to have an easy online class and this was not it.  Makes videos of herself talking with puppets and then you have to do an assignment on what the underlying meanings of it were.  Very strange assingments. Quizzes extremely specific once a week. Many discussion posts and responses to others.,0
This is for HUM200. He makes you buy 8 novels and theres no exams only papers. You talk about completely irrelevant information every class and he ALWAYS talks 15 minuets over the end of the class for no reason.,0
"Her class is tough. The course material is interesting but when it comes to taking the exam, she words her question in a way that makes you think in a whole new direction. During office hours, she can be helpful but a lot of the times she just says what incorrect or correct. She also likes statistics, not opinion! It's her way or the highway.",0
nice lady but come off as rude sometimes. she does not know how to teach. she goes through example problems way too fast and doesnt explain where she gets any of the numbers. one of the most boring and pointless classes cuz i had to reteach myself everything,0
Hensley  is the worst professor Ive had! He is very rude man,0
Very amazing and intriguing prof. Really loves to see students think and figure things out for themselves. You get what you put in. Controversial grading system: do whatever you want for an evaluation and he marks you on your originality and depth of thought. Genuine and inspirational. ,1
"She was ok, but really doesn't try to understand her students. Goes off on her own tangent. Classes are extremely boring and she is very repetitive. Takes extremely long to return papers and is very confused in class. Personally, I did not find her a helpful professor. But not a lot of tests or essays which I like",0
"Awful. Not an English class. Take this class if you want to debate and hate the gov't. Discuss and talk about imaginary aliens that would ""rape every orifice"" on you. The government is out to get us and everyone is racist. There was NO structure on what he expected from papers. His feedback is condescending and unhelpful. Not encouraging/inspiring.",0
"Dr Chang teaches Probability Theory in a way that is plug chug. Does not go over the meaning of the topics in this course. Only shows how to compute Problems. The book chosen is a great book (Degroot), however, it can be hard to read at times. Due to Chang's teaching style, the proper book was not chosen. I will not be taking any courses with Chang",0
"I honestly hated her class, shes probably the worst drawing teacher Ive had so far. She just wont shut up! you barely draw. She lectues you on a bucnh of useless things  and makes you go through an entire process just to get one unfinished looking still life done. Be prepared to draw the same still life over and over again.",0
"grading is really tough, the average of test 1 in fall term is 70, however we only have 48.",0
"Landscape Planning is essentially a course title assigned to a once-a-week class where students work individually on their own research projects, and Dr. Kulhavy meets with you and helps your progress. Dr. Kulhavy is awesome! He's calm, organized, and genuinely cares about his students. He's very knowledgable and aims for every project to be great!",1
":( Im usually an honor roll student. taking this class makes me feel like Im dumb. There is a quiz every class period and hes not clear on whats on them. Even when he is, they are next to impossible to get 100%. It could be me, but personally I would not recommend this class. Solid 0/10.",0
"He made me hate chemistry, the guy is so knowledgeable that he think on a different level than us and therefore can't explain anything. Test are difficult and have questions that aren't from the book. Doesn't explain things clearly nor does he care about students. He is literally the worst teacher I've ever had in my life.",0
Amazing prof! Great lectures with lots of examples and practical information. Great lab instructor with clear instructions and very helpful.  She's really nice and has lots of experience in the industry. She encourages and inspires her students! Assignments were lots of fun and a good mix of independent and group work. Fair marker.,1
"Incredibly inspirational! Bettina is both a serious and hilarious lecturer. She incorporates her own experiences as an activist into her teaching. A decent amount of reading but it's not excessive, and there were only three papers assigned throughout the course. Highly recommend!",1
"He expects way to much from his students, doesn't give us guidelines of the course and whats expected of us. He's tries to be funny and mean (which he is) but then in turn it makes students scared to ask questions, then he gets mad and yells at us that we arent asking questions. Buddy curved our midterm form 23% to 46% ... he will give everyone F's",0
"Great Professor I'd recommend her to anybody, she's very funny and you dont even really need to go to class to get an A. Studying the book is a definite must but at least that way you know exactly what you should lear. All her lectures are available on-line which is nice, study the book hard you should do well, all those who dont like her dont work",1
Corrigan is awesome. He gives pop quizzes but they are only three questions and as long as you do the reading you are fine. He loves when people asks questions because he loves making sure everyone is understanding. Definitely the best philosophy professor at Assumption.,1
"This prof is amazing. Great notes,teaches concepts with great focus and provides examples in the class to make sure all follow his lectures. He is very polite and respectful. His speaks English fluently and encourages students to use proper technical English in reports. His midterm test is tough but fair. I recommend his course to take.",1
ridiculous...most arrogant human being I've met. God forbid If you're not one of his favorites and haven't devoted your entire life to econ,0
"Avoid her at all costs, harsh teacher, awful grader. Boring class. Take any other teacher for 312",0
"Gasparian is hard to understand. His explanations are not clear and he just brushes you off if you still don't understand. The tests are not easy, even though they are open book, open notes. I would not take this professor again. He was not prepared for any class, he just walked in and didn't know what was going on for the day.",0
"The only good thing about this class is that he is a pretty nice guy, HOWEVER, I highly recommend never taking this course. Nothing is clear that he explains and if you ask for him to clarify he goes on a passionate yelling spree instead of actually clarifying. He gives no assignments other than like three tests which are short and very specific.",0
He's the best instructor I've ever come across. He is very passionate about what he does and cares about each person. He's entertaining and is more than willing to help any time you need it. He's extremely knowledgeable when it comes to music. A great guy.,1
"i completely agree that he's a great guy, but not an effective professor.  other students think he's great, but i didn't find him clear at all.  i had to take the MPRE after this class and there was a SIGNIFICANT amount of material on it that he never even",0
"What is supposed to seemingly be an easy 100-level history class, he makes it extremely hard. Nice guy but he DOES NOT give powerpoints, no worksheets to work off, just VERBAL LECTURES. The notes from his verbal lectures did not do me justice in any of the exams. Everything I wrote was unsatisfactory or not detailed enough even if I wrote novels.",0
"This course is difficult in some ways and easy in others. It's a language course so you have to have interest to learn and committment to study. As long as you work hard and it shows, Higurashi-sensei will value your efforts. Attend office hours as needed and study hard! Great teacher who's animated, funny and sweet.",1
"She is very discouraging and tries to make it seem like what you want to achieve is not the right path. She is not very helpful and pretty much tells you to do everything yourself. I am doing well in my classes and come to see if i'm on the right track, but still finds away to make you doubt yourself.... Do not take this counselor.",0
Only used the book for assignments. Not a bad teacher,1
"She is wonderful. Very informative, and gives lots of help and information in the class as well as out. she is also my advisor as well.",1
"Very little of the class is actually spent on improv. The first several weeks are just ""getting to know you"" games. I had heard great things about him which is why I took the class but he didn't live up to the hype. He interrupted and corrected improvs too often, which stifled creativity.",0
You can find everything you need for this class on the slides posted online. Prof is very helpful when you come to him with questions and the class is very easy.,1
"Was a big disappointment.  Kept cancelling class: either was away, or had a quiz, or just showing movies.  While very informed about the topic he did not put much effort into teaching and was condescending if you go to his office. GEO 702 mandatory for some engineering programs though.",0
"The best professor at Valley College. Infact, she is the best teacher I ever had since grade school!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"Newton took this class and made it way harder than it needed to be. There were tricky unfair pop quizzes, two exams, an insanely long group paper which she graded unbelievably hard and then a group presentation. At first the class seems easy because there aren't many assignments but second half of the semester was insane.",0
Extremely intelligent prof. Doesn't really care about grades. Very helpful!,1
"Horrible, not only is he a terrible teacher, but he also is rude. Even if you have a serious excuse(funeral to attend, sick family member, etc.) he won't allow you to retake a test. THAT ISN'T A JOKE. Horrible professor, seriously do not take his class. It is a surprise that he is even an educator.",0
"The only people who could possibly give this fantastic professor a bad rating are the unintelligent ones. Hes extremely clear about what you need to know, as borne witness by the thousands of times you'll hear him say 'so what this means is'. He gives you precisely what you need to know, and clearly loves anthropology.",1
only took this cause I needed the units. I was interested in chicano studies but she made the class dull. she doesn't post her lectures online so attendance is mandatory but she's such a bad & boring lecturer. readings are long. she expects too much and tends to be rude and forgets that we're in a pandemic!! not very empathetic which is ironic.,0
Very easy to listen to,1
"Wendy's definitely concerned with how well her class does, but just isn't a very good lecturer. Her lectures skip around a lot and don't properly explain things. There's often mistakes too. Her marking ranges from very easy to really pedantic and picky as well. The assignments aren't tough though. I hope you like Comic Sans on every slide...",1
best teacher ive ever had. She makes class interesting and is a very intelligent woman.,1
"LOL, I just notice that he literally put a lot of PUA-related content in his lectures.",0
"Awesome professor who really cares about her students! She even recognised me from her 200 student class in the drug store.  Papers (marked by the TAs) were fairly difficult, but on exams and midterms (marked by herself) it was very possible to achieve a high mark (eg above 90) which I don't think is possible in any other philosophy class at queens",1
"Took Professor McGregors class years ago. Good class; it was amazing taking a class from someone who pioneered history by helping to bring Ethnic Studies and native Hawaiian history to the forefront of mainstream society. Her lectures and videos helped to emphasize with the plight of native Hawaiians, whose history was often ignored.",1
PROFESSOR LEE HAS GIVEN ME A CLEARER UNDERSTANDING IN THE SUBJECT OF COLLEGE ALGEBRA. SHE IS PATIENT AND TRULY CARE FOR HER STUDENTS. I DEFINITELY TAKE HER CLASS AGAIN.,1
Evan is a great teacher! He's funny and through with his material. But like any class you can't slack off with the reading because the quizzes are based off of them! I would take him again!,1
"Studying for tests in his class is impossible. He is incredibly unclear about what needs to be studied, and even more unclear about what to actually take as notes. I find myself often questioning if what he's talking about is important or not. What's worse is that he rarely has a powerpoint, and when he does it's just pictures. Hard to study with.",0
"Amazing! He really cares about his students, he wants you to become a better writer and he relates to his students and lets that be what the papers are about. You can choose topics and as long as you show up and put a little bit of effort into the class you pass with ease.",1
"Lectures go on forever, repeating her points 5x before moving on. Ends midsentence to jump to another tangent, never to return to the original topic. Just when you think she's done, she'll keep going.   In my horror cinema, we managed to have enough time for around 20m of actual movie time, in a MOVIE class",0
"Professor Nearing's class is super fun! I took her Summer II and I am a dual enrollment student. She is easy to talk to. She requires that you attend her class on some days, while other days are optional. The work takes a while but it is easy. She gives you the quiz and final questions, which is great! I would take this class again! Recommend:)",1
Waxler is a cool dude. This short story course is a must for anyone trying to get some lit credits. Interesting reading and neat discussions.,1
She is such a sweet and understand professor! She is lenient yet takes her material very seriously. You can tell she is very interested in what she teaches and she gives amazing feedback for papers so you know exactly what you need to do.,1
I almost fell asleep every time I went to class because he just reads off a power point that he doesn't post online.  He highlights key points for your essays on exams that a necessary for getting a good grade.,0
"a complete mean, arrogant man. Had for visual fund. He recently told the class that we deserved to die if we did not vote (in which it is against some of the classmates religion) and also that 85 percent of the class is waisting their time in school and will be working in retail in their future. Forgive me if i am wrong, but teachers are to help mo",0
"Nuclear Weaponry.  Subject is interesting, but heavily based on an understanding of science, which is not my forte.  I was very lost in the class and struggled with the readings.  He helped me when I asked for it (though he wasn't very clear), but I got the distinct impression that he'd given up on me as a student.  Bad class for me, personally.",0
He responds to emails faster than any other professor I've had. He's super kind and helpful. I would definitely recommend!,1
"She is such A DOLL, I really enjoy her and the class. If you do the work you well pass, if you need help she will help you because she want you to pass and do the work. Make sure you follow her direction if she changes the assignment up because you well lost point but if you do that it pretty easy A.",1
"Don helped me to understand finance very well. I took finance once before with a bad prof and come out not liking finance because I didn't get it, but Don was a great prof and knows what he is talking about and teaches it well. I would definitely take a class from him again.",1
"Your grade is based on 4 exams alone, doesn't collect homework, give extra credit, or even collect or grade quiz's. There's no room for improvement if you do not do well on all of the exams. He doesn't use MyAccountingLab online but it is there for reference, more than half the students in the class aren't aware of it and neither is he. ",0
"I had him for 111, and it was awful. I didn't have the greatest chem in high school, but it was rare that I understood him. If you are like really into all the theory behind chem take this class, if you are just taking it because you need a chem class stay away. He also requires a 20 page paper. I ended up with an A so it could've been worse...",1
"Unprepared, very confusing. 1st and 2nd day of class he gave a pop quiz trying to weed out people from his class. Explaining if they did poorly they'll never do well in the class. Must read your text as that is how you'll learn, he goes over few examples in class, you basically need to teach yourself. I've never had problems in math, until now.",0
She's not my fav. She would cover many sections in one class and didn't care if you understood it and then expects you to do all of the hw from those sections. She picked the hardest problems from the book for the test. I didn't learn anything. And if your phone goes off in class she deducts pts from your future test!,0
"Anne is an amazing professor. She sets high expectations and is very tough, but you'll learn a lot. A former student of hers correctly advised me ""you'll feel like you're failing the entire time, but if you do all the work you'll get an A."" Make friends, you'll need them. PS going to class is worth it just to see her shoes. Best dressed hands down.",1
I loved having Professor Engle. I thought this class would be a bore but he actually made me love it and I would definitely take more film classes. He makes you work for your grade but he is always there to help when needed. Highly recommend!,1
"Kind of annoying to do the self-tests for every chapter, but at least he cut them down from 30 to 15 questions.  You learn a lot from him, and the tests are super-easy, especially if you go to the review sessions.  Easy A, no prob.  If you're going to take nutrition, take Dr. Logo over anyone else!",1
"If you want an easy a and love to slack, don't take his class. You have to read & discuss what you've read. He goes on in his lecture, which can open ones perspective. Overall this class is easy as long as you keep up with the readings, and if your having trouble opening your mind you can talk to him about it.",1
"While I found her easy to talk to, I don't feel like talking to her was all that productive. Because it was a creative writing class, I enjoyed it; however, it was due to the fact that I had other students in the class that were great writers and learning from them the highlight for me.",1
"This professor literally reads off of his powerpoint and does not teach or explain anything in any way. By far worst professor I have ever and I highly recommend that anyone taking him to get out immediately and switch classes. Otherwise, you will be spoken to like an imbecile and will be teaching yourselves throughout the entire semester.",0
"The worst coding class I have ever taken in my life. If you miss one thing on the ""daily exercises"" the TAs give you a 75 for that assignment. This can really tank your grade for no reason. Just reads slides. You can get an A if you are an experienced coder and are OCD about every minute detail. But since this is an intro class, take someone else.",0
His lectures are very confusing. Tends to be unorganized and his accent makes it more difficult to follow.,0
"This professor will cover one topic, then skip two chapters ahead right after a short explanation. Don't stress about good note taking because you literally won't be able to organize it. She uses DESMOS for class work AND to complete webworks but doesn't allow it on tests? Do not take this professor if you struggle with math, it makes it harder.",0
"Great professor. You have to actually read and pay attention in class to do well, but the material is not very hard at all. Just follow her study guides and notes to the letter and you will do very well. I got an A in this class, and I had no interest in literature at all prior to this class.",1
"She's very rude, don't bother asking her anything. When you ask questions during lecture, she will make you feel stupid for it. She is very biased in her grading of labs. Address her as Dr. Aikins, she like that. That's all the bad stuff, if you study her study guides you will pass.",0
"Mr. Brooks was not my favorite, he was very monotoned so when you are in class it is very hard to stay focused. When working from home/online he is very short and not helpful in the slightest. Once working from home he would assign tests but not announce to you that you had an assignment. they were hidden in folders and not made known to students.",0
"Strongly advise you take this course with someone else. 3 tests, 30% x2 and final worth 40%. NO guidelines to whats on the tests, he just stays ""know it all"". The lectures are absolutely useless. The first two tests included ZERO lecture material, the final includes ALL semesters worth of it. 500+ page readings a week. He ruined interesting content",0
"Literally worst prof I have ever had. Don't take any classes with her. Nothing but stress, ridiculous tests each week. Does not specify what she wants, blackboard is all over the place you can't find anything.",0
This class pretty much followed the book exactly. It helped you understand the concepts of programming but the book basically tells you exactly what to do. The assignments are grouped into 3 deadlines so you have to make sure you can keep yourself motivated. He was amazing at returning grades quickly. I always got mine back within 24 hours.,1
He begins class with joke. Most are dirty but funny. He does a great job explaining the course material and makes history interesting. I missed a test day but he just counted my next text twice. Just make sure to read the book to pass his tests. Great guy.,1
Can't quite put it into words. Professor Danae Martinez is wildly unselfish.,1
"Very passionate about his topics. He is very kind and has funny moments, and wants students to succeed. His lecture style is not for everyone, but overall is a great professor.",1
"You get partial credit for written Qs on exams. Took this course over the summer and was suprisingly not as intense as I expected. I'm bad in math so I struggled with chem math, but still got a B. Turn in homework and labs and it helps ur grade A LOT. No lab practicals and TAKE HOME lab final. I HIGHLY recommend Prof. Z. Really cool guy",1
"She is like any normal professor, if you repeatedly do not show up it affects your grade. You mostly get online work, which I believe is graded off of completion, however I could be wrong. You receive 3 papers in the class, which are not difficult, the textbook is needed. Overall she is very understanding as long as you do what you should be doing!",1
Sean Uppal is hands down the best prof in the mathematics department. He sincerely really cares about his students. I felt bad for him as he has to deal with first years who think they can do what they did in high school which is not study and then still expect an A. His tests are easy compared to the other math courses despite the low averages.,1
"Awsome professor! Very helpful. Yes, she has attendance policy, but that is what you are paying for - a class.  Just study the definitions from the book, and you will get at least a B.  On the tests, ask her, and she will almost give you the answer.",1
"In the midterm and final exam, he is looking for very specific answers. Dumping answers will cost you marks. Participation matters in this course. He will not hesitate to give you a 020 in participation. Honestly, the course concepts are very applicable, but the way he tests is not reflective of your knowledge. ",1
"Grades distributed to be 50% from 2 midterms and 50% from a final. Medians for both midterms in the 50s, and curves the final median grade to a C+. Every lecture was on multiple or one huge proof, and hopefully you're lucky and study the right ones that are on the midterm/final. No practice tests or hints of what would be on the tests. Confusing.",0
"By far the worst class I've ever taken in UDel. She is not clear about what she is rendering in the UDcapture. Every piece of knowledge is thrown chaotically without an order. As an intro class, she expects you to recite all the names of the nutrients/the diseases, the effects and the calculations. Insane course load and horrible grading standard.",0
She was really understanding when students didnt enjoy something but she was super unorganized,1
plays a lot of movies and videos then lectures for a bit. Tests are all multiple choice but are challenging at times.,1
Ugh. Every class I attend sucks another breath from my soul.,1
Best professor at Hostos Community College. Love her,1
"This is the first online class where the professor actually post in the discussions! He is the best online professor I've ever had! The course is not bad but you have to put in the work. I like that he left little notes after grading the discussion, and essays. If I could rate a 10, I would!",1
"Hilts is hands down, by far one of the BEST profs at macewan. He makes lectures very interesting. Always more than willing to help in office hours,underatanding and extremely  thankful that you go for absolutely  any clarification. Exams are all written, but he's super big on part marks, and exams are VERY similar to practice exams. Amazing prof.",1
She was the coolest! She was really nice and really helpfull!!,1
class makes me want to change me major.,0
Professor Lee thinks everyone is an expert. The reading in the class is insane. I eventually began skimming and my grades showed it. They seem useless until the test hits. He doesn't provide a powerpoint just an outline that he writes on the wall. You need to take good notes to pass. Pretty much write as much as you can down. Use EC opportunity!,0
I took calc 1 as an online course meeting for 2 hrs twice a week and class was v boring. Professor Austin explains concepts for 10 minutes and then gives a worksheet to you to work on in small groups. The worksheets were extremely hard because you don't know what you are doing. Ask for help from him in small groups. Wouldn't recommend taking him...,1
"My best buddy and I took this class together. He's a conservative thinker and put a lot of effort into very thought out papers. Grade was in the Bs. Me, couldn't care less about this class there were more important things on my mind. Wrote lacking papers, but was what she wanted to read: how Democrats are basically better than Reps, got an A.",0
"Take anyone else for writing composition. I didn't enjoy this professor's lack of respect towards her students. Tough grader, have to go to class or you'll fail, pushes agenda on students, just don't take her.",0
Lee is really great. Funny and creative,1
"Dr. Hauck is amazing!!! If you struggle with upper-level science classes like me, definitely take his class. It's difficult but very clear and he really cares about his students. He is great about working one on one with you and is super easy to talk to in office hours.",1
Fantastic Professor! Very easy to talk to and is more than willing to help. Class is fun and humorous.,1
"He is very clear. While not easy, his assignments were not hard. His exams were relatively easy, but you need to know how to prove your theorems quickly since you are under time pressure, you don't have time to re-derive everything.",1
"This man is the worst professor I've ever had. He is arrogant and self-centered and could care less about his students. He grades irrationally, and couldn't seem to give me a straight answer about the grades I was getting, even when he did actually show up to his office hours. Stay away.",0
"Professor Martin is a genuine, authentic guy. While I think he's very wise, he is a horrible teacher. His slides don't make sense, and when he lectures It can be very hard to follow. Additionally, his class is very unorganized overall and he often seems unprepared. Don't take his course.",0
"I love Daddel as a person, but not as a professor. His lectures were less than engaging, and he assigned hw as if his course was the only responsibility his students face in life. He expects so much in so little time, on his tests and hw, that I was just scrambling to get things done on time rather than actually learning throughout the course.",0
Went crazy a few semesters back but seems to be back on track.,1
"The most arrogant professor ever. Incredibly vague on his expectations. Avoid at all costs. MUST attend all lectures, does not post anything online.",0
The one thing I liked about her is that her tests are usually like the review. One thing I didnt like was how strict she was on grading essays. She would take up to 15 points off for slightly citing something incorrectly and acted as if this were an English class instead of a sociology class. Her lectures were pretty boring but overall Was nice,0
"Best man. He is obviously very passionate about his field (particularly family/fatherhood), and his stories always entertained me. For exams, know the PowerPoints and textbook definitions. I thought the exams were fairly straightforward especially if you go to class since he writes them exactly like talks. He does curve!",1
"Had him for UGS 302: Crime Control. Never specified how grades would be determined and decided to give basically the whole class Bs because according to him, no one participated in class. The class itself was easy and the material was repetitive. Awful professor though.",0
"Professor Kerr was a very nice lady but in my opinion, she was not teacher material. She only grades on tests and it's kind of difficult to pass her class if you are not very test-savvy. I am not a good test taker, and I usually get all my points from homework and participation. She is solely based on tests. She had a mono-tone voice too.",0
"Open book midterms and final, study examples you will receive a good grade.",1
"I don't hate many people. BUT I HATE THIS PROFESSOR! She is condescending, rude, conflict specific and incredibly uncompromisable. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. She is unfair with her grading, will not accommodate for sick days or family deaths   I'm a white male. one time she said to me, ""People like you need to realize they can't get their way"". wow. ",0
"He comes off as snobby about what he teaches and he expects you to understand the material right off the bat. He's a ridiculous grader, almost unfair. He went so far as to grade my proposed subject for my final paper. He wastes most of the class time talking about one subject then giving us a grammar and punctuation lesson. Ridiculous. DO NOT TAKE!",0
Got through the class with the help of Google and fellow classmates trying to figure out what she wanted specifically on assignments. If you know JAVA you have a better chance of getting good grades. Would recommend going to other campuses and avoiding taking a class with this teacher if you are not willing to work hard to get the grades you want.,0
"Arrogant jerk who likes the sound of his own voice. It may look like he cares about his students when you're in his class, but he can't even remember your name afterwards. He is an up-tight, egostistical ass.",0
"The most interesting class I took all semester. While he is a little scatterbrained and random he will work with you and help you to the best of his ability, even if it includes delaying an assignment etc. If you can stand a little disorder I would definitely recommend him.",1
Consistently made mistakes while lecturing and would easily become frustrated with any student who asked for help. She would literally laugh out loud when students made mistakes and loudly speak with the in class tutor about how terrible she felt students were doing. Online assignments consistently marked correct answers wrong - very frustrating!,0
"I only had him for lab but I plan to take him for lecture next semester, he is super helpful with the labs and is very clear in explaining instructions.",1
I was really excited about this class because my first humanities class was interesting. This guy is awful. Doesn't seem like he wants to help at all. I've NEVER made anything less than a B in any class. I received a C-. His grading is unclear an when you ask for help he won't give it. Teachers are supposed to help. He wouldn't at all.,0
"How does this person get this job? Why would the president allow him to teach here? There is no teaching, just boring regurgitation of old outdated notes.",0
"I find this professor to be Galatians and he is my favorite. Only thing, test are very hard and you have to learn most of your stuff outside of class.",1
"THE WORST TEACHER YOU'LL EVER HAVE IN YOUR LIFE. she wont help you no matter what you do, and if you ask her a question in class she will most likely belittle you.",0
A good teacher who is caring and gives lots of homework but is fair and will work with you.,1
"Pat is pretty cool, he is a huge nerd and loves the Packers. You will have papers to write and projects to do, there is also a large group project due by the end of the semester. His lectures are done on power point and he likes electronic and hard copies of papers.",1
Great teacher! Get in her class before it fills up!,1
Good guy. Not a good GenEd teacher. Most of our meetings are 20 minutes of him ranting about unclear directions and hammering on the same points and the remaining 30 is a lecture that gets cut short and is filled with conjecture. The workload is unreal for a gened and the projects have strict guidelines/prompts yet are impossible to find on canvas.,0
"If I was rating personality I would say Munson was my favorite professor.  When it came to his class, it was the hardest class I have yet to encounter.  I didn't learn anything and didn't comprehend any of the material.  He assumes you know all of the material.  If you are a wiz at chem take him if you can, if not avoid his class at all costs.",0
He is extremely difficult.  He doesn't seem interested in helping his students do well.  He is extremely smart and gives you a lot of information.  It would be a great course if he was a little more personal.,0
"I am an alum. I had Dr. Brady for Calc 1, Calc 2 and Honors Calc 3 (he let me in the class even though my grades didnt reflect the honor) back in the late 1980s. I have forgotten the names of 95% of the teachers I had. But I will never forget Stephen Brady. He is a gem. WSU is lucky to have him.",1
"Currently wrapping up her class, and it is great. She is very helpful, very insightful, laid back. She creates a chill atmosphere and yet, teaches in a way that sticks with you. She's also sexy",1
"Mr Farris is a really smart guy, but he makes the class is extremely difficult. He expects you to know the material the first time he teaches it and there is A LOT of stuff to learn and memorize. He doesn't explain things very well and you will not pass if you don't study super hard and pay attention in class. Had to drop his class",1
"If you want to learn history this is not the guy for you. If you want to learn how to read a ton of pages, write several papers, and take exams which are only free response and essays then Turkovic is your guy. Not my cup of team but maybe he is yours.",0
"He is really hard(easy midterm, really tough final), and rushes the material.  I would avoid taking him again.",0
AVOID THIS CLASS She is probably the worst math teacher Ive ever had in my life. When she is trying to teach she just puts answers down and doesnt explain how she got there. She doesnt answer questions in class time. She is the worst professor Ive ever had,0
Summer online class. WARNING! Requirements include a webcam that must be on you during exams and quizzes at least and wants to see the entire room you are in. No one can be in the room with you. Did not work for me as I have small kids in the house. No compliance  a 0. NOT HELPFUL! Did not respond to course messages. Requires Mindtap. I dropped it,0
"Prof. Chung is one of the most intelligent people you will ever meet. With that, she seems to assume that everyone knows the same as her when Chem101 didn't scratch the surface of what this class is made of. I read the book inside and out, went to TA's regularly and still did't come out on top. She gives UB a good name for her research. Just beware",0
"Honestly, I dont understand how he is still able to teach at OCADU. He uses the same old boring slides every year, and every semester. They are not useful, and he puts no effort in delivering updated content and techniques to his students. He is always late for his classes, and unprepared. He's also very arrogant! Horrible teacher.",0
"Professor Pell speaks very quickly, it can be hard to catch her pace most of the time but if you do your revision after every class, you should be fine. Also, do your homework and attend classes, score the free marks it will help tremendously.",0
Not the best professor. if you don't have the same opinion be prepared not to do well on tests.,0
He only gives take home tests and rarely teaches.  Just make sure you are on his good side and you will do well.,0
"LOVED THIS CLASS!!!!  Dr. Morton is such a great teacher and soo funny.  I looked forward to this class every week, and wished I could have spent more time in the history department learning from this man.",1
"Tough course.   A lot of reading, homeworks, and quizzes, in addition to 2 midterms, and a cumulative final exam that forces you to know the material from day one.  You should study before lecture to get the most out of it.   It's hard work, but it's worth it.   ",1
"BE CAUTIOUS: not your typical history class. A LOT OF READING. ALOT OF WRITING.. no final which is a plus you do you have to role play scenarios in history. this can be fun but quite time consuming if you need to study for other classes. McFall will make you think that this core, 3 credit course is the most important class to him. Prepare 2 interac",1
Worst math class ever! Goes over material too fast. Before you get one thing done he is already starting another.,0
"Class time goes by fast, very clear and neat chalkboard presentations, wants to help students, as long as you show him you are trying you'll do well.",1
"The professor taught an online course that was not ADA or 508 compliant. The course had only five assignments in the grade-boo and absolutely no online discussions. If the course ended on a Monday, no assignments were graded until the Saturday before, two days before the course ended.",0
Amazing class! She is hands down one of the best Profs I've ever had.,1
"Garver is a really cool guy, and is really knowledgeable in the subject. The course isn't extremely hard, but its not easy; if you're interested in music industry you should be able to pass, no problem. I look forward to having Garver for other muin classes.",1
"She is the worst. Lectures confuse more than they help. The quizzes sometimes contains things she actually said would not be on there. The lectures do not cover everything you need. Four of us work together on homework. My partner and I turn in the same exact thing as the second partnership, but they got an A and we a B. How is that even possible??",0
I never take the time do write reviews on professors but for professor Peruyer i just had to! Professor Peruyera is the BEST professor MDC can offer. He knows what he's talking about. All of his lectures are given with plenty of examples. Very caring. Defiantly taking Buisness law 2 with him.,1
"Honestly you will find on here a couple of comments of how he is strict about timing and the guidelines and takes the class seriously for no reason and all of this is true. He chooses favs and if you're anything but catholic you're better off not taking him, he's two-faced and will pretend to like you all the way up to when your grades are posted",0
I don't know if it is him or the class itself but it's VERY difficult. Makes you feel stupid when asking questions and poor office hour times.,0
"Worst grad class I've taken. Some interesting discussions, but her syllabus nor rubrics matched our class. First class I didn't get an A in. No feedback until final grades. I got nothing out of the class.",0
"Apparently, VU's administration did not know much about how outstanding of a professor he was! I will always remember Professor Venturelli, he was the best I ever had even though many of the narrow minded students never understood him and could not see beyond their myopic vision. My mom had him and everything she was true.",1
"i cried so many times over this class. instruction was unclear, there was no working with her, clarification was confusing she was outright rude to students in class. i was afraid to ask questions over fear of her singling me out. her handwriting was incomprehensible chicken scratch. and u dont get a grade until END OF SEMESTER. DO NOT TAKE CLASS",0
"he drives me insane.  maybe if he cared about what he was teaching i would too, but he puts me to sleep and makes me not want to do anything.",0
Yeah.,1
"She is a very hard prof and doesn't seem very interested in her students. I fact one time I asked her a question and all she said was I do not understand why you don't get it, as someone else. I felt this was very rude and honestly it upset me.",0
"Professor Stewart was a fantastic professor. She cares a lot about her students and she isn't afraid to slow down and focus on topics that students struggled to comprehend. She used a lot of real world examples, and would often take time to relate the class to current events. I learned so much from this class and I'd take it again in a heartbeat.",1
Course ended up being pretty dull. He forgets that his students are taking other classes and loads on a lot of reading. He also ordered too many books and the class ended up costing me more money than I have ever spent on an English class. I would not take him again.,0
"Literally the best teacher I have had. Supported me through class and beyond. Is passionate about both learning and teaching how biology can cure some of the most difficult health problems. Her class is designed so that you can learn which ever way is easiest for you, tests are fair yet tough, and you have chances to recover from a poor grade.",1
"This class has been the death of me. Not only is it impossible to get in contact with Professor Blose outside of class (don't even bother emailing him he will not respond) but he made being lectures miserable. The class was constantly correcting him for mistakes in examples provided, and he seemed to always think it was funny. Please retire.",0
"I like Professor Duina's teaching style a lot, he always encourage student to participate in class and the homework assignment is really ON POINT and clear. Trust me you'll start to appreciate his teaching techniques after the semester ends.",1
He wears blazers with leather patches on the sleeves. He looks like such a proffesor,1
I thought I was not going to pass the class b/c she's a tough grader. But she knows that she is a tough grader so she gives a LOT of extra credit opportunities to make up for it. I had a constant C throughout the quarter until I turned in my portfolio. Passed the class w/4.0. Advice: ask questions when in doubt & buy the textbook & don't be lazy!!!,1
WORST teacher I have ever had! He calls people out in class just to embarrass them. Tests are 90 questions in 50 minutes and essay topics are given to you the day before they are due. The final exam is worth 50% of your grade. AVOID AAT ALL COSTS!,0
"Dr Ouyang knew the subject matter very well.  Text Book was a waste.  Current events portion was good in that we had to explore issues with other students.  Online homework app was poor.  Two papers and a final exam were required.  For a non-accting major, it was a lot to absorb in such a short time.  I did learn the topic thoroughly though.",1
SMAD 251 AND 301. Let's just say I have a crush on him and I wouldn't be ashamed if he knew it. SMAD 251 is cool and a fun class but if you have written/read a script before then you don't really learn too much. 301 is late but only one day a week. Turner is deathly boring so take Reynolds. He really facilitates discussion and we look at clips,1
"There are over 30 articles expected to be memorized for each exam. The final exam has over 60 articles with no study guide. You must also read the textbook for each exam or you wont pass. Lectures are not posted online so attendance is a must. There's a curve, but that's because the avg grade for the 1st exam was a 55. Without it most would fail.",0
"Everything you read in this profile is correct (except for the praise). I did decent in the class, but seriously, I'm among the top performers in any class I take, so unless you consider yourself in that category you are not going to do well. I never write reviews but he has rubbed me the wrong way with just how extreme this class is.",0
"Great teacher, actually wants you to learn the material and pass the class.  Grades tests very fairly, trying to give you the highest grade you earned.  Great teaching style, I learned the most about any math course in this class.",1
Good Guy Mediocre Professor. I dropped the class and I stand by my decision. Nice guy but it didn't work out,0
"Best professor in acct department. Very nice person, respect and care every student. No homework at all plus huge curve on exam. Really enjoy his class.",1
"3 essays (10% each), 3 exams (15% each), 2 textbooks. He is a slow talker and his British accent sometimes makes it difficult to understand. He gives lecture on his notes and says you won't pass if you don't have lecture notes. He is an okayy professor. The discussion class for this lecture is honestly not needed.",1
"Overall Ivo is a great guy, but I didn't learn anything in the class. Easy A, but he goes off in his own little world half the time so I spent my time in the class drawing. He assigns papers that may seem daunting, but just spark note the readings and you'll get the info and A's on your papers.",0
"He might be a good teacher for other things but NOT for Theory. He makes things very complicated. He is a fun and lovable person outside of class but in class he'll make you pull your hair out. If you are the kind of person who needs things broken down simple, Massinon is NOT for you.",0
"Professor Regan is a nice, funny guy. I wanted to like his class. I wanted to become a better writer. Did not happen. Regan is an extremely tough grader. He does not always give clear expectations and office hour appointments are good to show you care and he likes when you come (grade helper) but don't expect actual help.",0
Mr. Bunn is a great teacher. He's the head of the acc. dept. and holds lots of titles. Very knowledgeable and explains things clearly. Likes to show random cartoons on overhead during breaks. Great guy! However semi-hard class and tests are a bit tough,1
"Very wishy washy. He will decide one thing one minute, and change his mind the next. Makes you participate in a Global Business Game, impossible..then tests you on it. Even harder. Try to avoid taking him. Pretty nice guy, just not the greatest teacher.",0
He goes over the course too fast. He went over a semester worth of course within 2 months. All he did was review for the last month. so bascially skip class? you will not pass or you can just by hitting the books forever. ,0
"If you're looking for a brush up on your math skills and you don't have any learning issues, this class is for you. There is no lecture and class participation. You have to rely on Alexs to instruct you in new topics if Alexs doesn't line up with your other assinments you've got to teach your self or fall behind.",0
"Waited until the last day of classes to release all of our grades. Gave no helpful feedback on any assignment if he did give feedback at all. The ePortfolio is incredibly useless, and our capstone curriculum and grade should not revolve around it. He does not care about his students.",0
"Sa Signature:Ãcologiste humaniste altermondialiste coopÃ©rativiste postcapitaliste. Si vous prÃ©fÃ©rez un cours oÃ¹ l'idÃ©alisme prend un second rÃ´le derriÃ¨re la rÃ©alitÃ©, voir ailleurs. De plus, sa plus grande exigence est la prÃ©sence, donc c'est pas un gage de haut niveau.",0
"Going into this class I was excited to learn about philosophy but coming out of it, I don't think I will ever take another philosophy class again and if I do it will definitely not be with Jeff. He's an easy grader but will tell students that their opinions are wrong and force them to agree with his own opinions by arguing with what they have said.",0
"His handwriting is terrible and he does not make sense when he comments back on your work. For an intro course his grading is difficult and he doesn't like too much detail in his essays which doesn't make sense. I would rate this teacher from a scale of A-F, a C.",0
Lectures were really dull. Had only a few assignments but daily readings. You have to pay attention in class and take notes in order to write said papers. I put a ton of effort into the couple of papers we had to read and I probably could've done less. He's British so his sense of humor is rather dry.,1
Take this class while you can. He is so good I doubt he will be around forever.,1
Grades more grammer and writing than content. would not recommend this particular professor.,0
"Great prof! Very interesting and short lectures. Very good with words and is friendly, highly recommend. BUT the assignments and exam are all essay-style and the lectures are mandatory (NO online/ACE component)",1
"He takes off points on tests that are unnecessary. I took AP Calc in high school and received an ""A"". I thought this class would be a GPA booster with Orgo and A&P however I had worked more at this class than anything. Don't take him for calc. I got an A- in the course however I think this was VERY unfair for the work I put in. He is so awkward",0
"he was amazing and lightened the mood, kind of a fun class when you did preforming arts and debate",1
Excellent prof.,1
super boring class.. lots of reading and essays every week.. be prepared to fall asleep.. requires attendance and participation!!,0
"Hutchens teaches a bit different than most lecture professor. We basically had to teach each other, and he would help teach as we went. We had an easy quiz every week about the topic. Be sure to read! BEWARE Hutchens is very passionate about Psychology and would go off on a tangent almost every time he talked.",1
"Don't enjoy his class, tests are very hard. But he is not boring",0
"you have to read the book and half way pay attention in class and you should do ok.  He grade on a cerve which is good and no longer does essay questions, atleast not on the 101 corse.  He is cool, laid back, and you miss alot of classes, but he is cool otherwise.",1
"Definitely my favorite professor! I wish I had taken the course in-class instead of online because I'm sure his lectures would have been amazing! But, the online course was awesome and Dr. Hallett was very clear on his expectations for assignments and activities. Really great course, really great professor!",1
he is the man!,1
"Second time having this professor for an online class. This time around, there was ABSOLUTELY NO feedback or communication. I've turned in 25 assignments and completed the final and still not one thing has been graded. Super disappointing considering this is an important class for my major.",0
"I never though I""d be writing a review but I took both his BIO class 117 and 118 and they were both pretty much the same. In the beginning its definitely easier material and you should definitely go to his lectures and study everything he gives you. The lectures are fun and great in discussion and he answers back very quickly. Grade reflects effort",1
"Extremely hard professor. The homework was difficult and his lectures in class are of no help. He has a heavy accent also. You will have to teach yourself the coursework, I used Chegg. I did NOT like him personally, he really doesn't like to help students, either doesn't care or really loves the saying ""tough luck."" Also never responds to emails.",0
"He is one of the smartest, most genuine professorsteachers I've had, though his lectures and assignments can be baffling they do push you to learn about yourself and your environment in new ways. ",1
He is be a good teacher (before u meet him).,1
Don't take this professor. She has a haughty attitude and is VERY moody!! She tries to make her students feel less than if they try to get clarification on a topic but she isn't so knowledgeable about the topic she is teaching.,0
"We NEVER stayed on topic in class.  Also, she presumed the entire class had taken some German in junior high or high school, but I had only taken Spanish, so I had a really rought time there.  I thanked my lucky stars for getting out with my B- both semesters.",0
"Good guy, good teacher",1
"A bit scary at first, but as long as you put in effort, she's pretty awesome.  Definitely knows her stuff, ended up having a great time.",1
"Prof. Hawker is a very lazy professor. Due to COVID it was an asynchronous class, which was bad because he didn't post actual lectures just lecture summaries of a few topics and leave out things that would end up being on the exam. I have other completely online classes and they were all good and actually helped me succeed. SO DO NOT TAKE HAWKER!!",0
"Another overpaid worthless tenured professor at USC... After 4 years at USC, this is the only one of 2 professors I throughly despise.  His class consists of his boring monotone lecutres, two essay tests (that you only have 50 mins to complete) & one paper on a movie I had to order all the way from Canada. DO NOT take this class unless you have too",0
"Professor Nicol was extremely accessible, responding to emails within hours and answering phone calls as well. Tests were relatively easy as long as basis of material was understood. With daunting and complicated content, Nicol did her best to provide answers and illustrations to difficult questions, and provided an overall great online course.",1
"Dr. Krueger is very easy going, likes participation and discussions.  She likes group activities and grades fairly.  4 assessments, 4 learning activities (mostly in class), 1 group application presentation as a final.  Didn't really use the book.  Lectures from PPT and tests from those slides and your notes on her lectures.",1
"The class itself is easy. I still don't recommend it though because you don't really learn anything. Professor Kelland is very hands-off and the information you need for the project is all over the place. He's also pretty snippy if you actually email him for help or because you can't find something. Overall, not a fan. Feels like I wasted my money.",0
"Favorite professor by far! Geography is not a course that comes naturally to me or that I found interesting, but he made it fun and exciting. Tests reflect lectures clearly... so it is important to place emphasis on the slides. Must go to class for participation. Go to his review sessions they are very helpful. Overall, great great person!!!!",1
My favorite teacher! She's really caring. Got a two day pass on one assignment which was helpful. She's positive and very friendly. The work in this class is a lot of your own thoughts and the quizzes were discussed before so you'll be prepared. Was a very chill class. I loved it,1
"A lot of reading! Very fast paced stuff. But.... you will learn so much if you try. He grades fairly and will give you opp to redo work you're not happy with... He's pretty cool about missed classes, but he has a lot of pop quizes...  I also think he's a cutie.. Anyway, if you take him... you have a great experience",1
"Great teacher. He's fun and give a lot of help when you don't understand something. There's 2 very small quizzes, and 4 projects which are easy if you do work in class and use the techniques he shows. There's 1 short essay due at the end of the course. I did all the projects,quizzes, and essay and barely passed with an A, he pushed you to do better",1
"She is a tough teacher, makes it harder than it really is. Her test are made to flunk you. Her labs are poorly designed, also uses Physio Ex which is irrelevant to anything we do. Don't take her unless you can remember an entire textbook with powerpoints and useless animal facts.",0
"just ridiculous. yeah he is very smart but he is not an educator. very heavy workload, VERY dry textbook (that he wrote himself, not surprising), HUUGE ego, unclear with initial expectations for essay writing.. yet very picky when marking for word choice, etc. very theoretically heavy... large emphasis on biographies and contributions of theorists",0
"I took this class online and probably could've done better if I was better at self-motivating. If you don't have a problem doing that, I definitely recommend this class. The entire class consists of a few really easy discussion boards, 5 exams, and a paper. Most of the exams can be found online, too.",1
dreadful DO NOT TAKE I REPEAT AVOID AND USE CAUTION!,0
"Good Christ it is time for the Heff to retire.  I had him for Creative Writing and Poetry, and both times he just rambles.  Never ever subject yourself to a class with Heffernan.  My favorite moment was when a fellow student wrote a poem mocking his tendency to talk about his ex-wife all the time, and everyone in the class but Heff got the joke.",0
Class is very laid back with no homework at all. Your whole grade is based off of four papers that he spends lecture preparing you for. No textbook needed just a reader. He is a nice guy who is always happy to teach. He treats everyone with respect. Overall he is an awesome professor. This is not your typical boring English class so TAKE HIS CLASS!,1
Avoid at all costs if you want a really good mark especially for an elective.,0
"From day one he comes off pretty brash, and he can be.  I took Film because I love movies, I expected to learn something new too.  I felt he overcompensates for people trying to take an easy class. His test are mostly fill in the blank and essay, so be prepared.",1
"Great prof! His accent (from England) makes everything better because he is hilarious and makes class fun. 10/10 would take him again. He's a super easy teacher, just do the homework and study for tests and you'll pass.",1
Easy A- just show up and do your assignments. Lectures were boring but she has a great personality so it was okay. Met at the gym every other week but she doesn't pay attention to see if you actually worked out or not. Never kept class the full time and the only test was the final. Overall easy class and made me like fitness a little more,1
"He is an excellent professor. His lectures engage you, he's a very good public speaker. On the personal side, he's a very helpful, nice fatherly figure. His class is, however, quite challenging b. Unlike what other people said, the readings are absolutely crucial to getting a good grade in the class. Recitations are pretty useless though.",1
LOVE this professor and the course! If you come to class everyday (which you should since there are exercises due each day) you will learn a lot. She is very helpful and wants students to understand editing. I am taking her again next semester and I can't wait!,1
"This man is the definition of wholesome. There are many assignments (4 papers throughout the semester, 4-6 pages each), but the topics are cool if you are interested in history and technological stuff. This class is not date/person recitation, but rather looking at the history of technology through larger trends and examples.",1
He is such a wonderful teacher. Everyone should take his class!!!!!,1
"Prof. Miura moved very slowly through lecture, so it was often hard to stay focused. He was a tough grader because he required all definitions and explanations to be exactly like his (oddly-worded) defs/explanations. Exams were conceptual and inconsistent with lecture material. It was helpful to read the textbook outside of class!",0
"I've taken Dr. Kim for several classes and will probably have him for a few more.  Be prepared to read, read, read..and then read some more.  Overall I like him but he's not easy and his expectations of you for his exams and papers can seem a bit vague.  Obviously very intelligent though, and competent in the material.  Take really good notes.",1
"Probably the best teacher I have ever had. Ive never felt more informed about countrys history and economic system. Latimer is straightforward and intelligent and I was dying throughout the lectures of laughter. The tests are extremely difficult but if you study you will do well. The answers are always there for you (multiple choice, matching).",1
You can't go wrong with him. Thorough explanations and straight forward.,1
"He is the best econ prof. at SMC. He is very clear, caring, and helpful. He is very hard, but fair.",1
"Long and dense lecture followed by a quiz that has little to do with anything he just taught, D- to C- average on almost all of them. Does not know how to effectively communicate and teach material. Changed grade weight distribution last week of school dropping scores anywhere from 4-8 points.",0
"Very unresponsive to emails, does not grade assignments in a timely manner. You really don't need to do much in the class because he never posts the topic assignments. Offers extra credit for showing up to Teams meetings that he ends up cancelling anyway.",1
Beware of this professor. He assumes that all his students come from same have same educational qualification and they all have to undergo his FIRE TEST. I knew I will fail his test as he will give you 50 MCQ 0.5 marks each with 5 choices to choose from. Then short answer questions which are as difficult to understand as this professor himself,0
thinks everyone who walks into his class is a math genius. the ONLY good thing about his class is that you do not need a book...his hand writing is completely unreadable so good luck,0
"I got a bad grade because I gave up in the class. Theres a stark difference between the content on her slides and whats on the midterms and exams. Thought I was doing so good and was prepared only to get a bad grade. If you wanna get a good grade, read the textbooks thoroughly and the slides. Its a lot of content but itll get u a good grade.",0
"Dr. Penning is the rudest Professor I have ever encountered. He was also my advisor but I requested to have someone else because he is so unbelievably rude, arrogant, and unhelpful. He also tweets about his students, and when he fails someone. He enjoys humiliating students in class too.",0
Great class.  Lots of writing.,1
"Very knowledgeable professor. Lectures are interesting, but a little dry. If you don't go to class you're not gonna pass the exams. Super helpful with the research paper. The class isn't easy, but if you want to learn then you should take him.",1
"Mrs Ryan was my favorite professor of my freshman year, and I hope to take many More classes with her in the future.",1
Awsome professor. Always available when you need his help. I took him for a summer class and things turned out to be more sucessful than what I thought. I highly recommend him!!,1
She never replies to emails,0
"she is very unclear, very unorganized and sometimes has an attitude with students after they dont understand her. she likes art though, and it shows. if you like writing and unclarity, take her art criticism.",0
not very open-minded!,0
"""Sexy Boy"". Killer Skies was one of the best classes I've taken. Looney kept me excited for class and did presentations effectively and with great humor. Highly recommend him in general. Online quizzes were tough but given multiple chances. Exams are somewhat hard so study. Never a dry moment, great guy, great topics. You're gonna have fun. Ciao",1
"Her attention span is very small. One cough and she'll stop the whole class to talk about our flu shots, then she spends an hour talking about that, then complains that we're so behind. She's unorganized. She'll come to class late and leave because she forgot our work. She made me delete a whole paragraph because the ""vocabulary was much too hard"".",0
"Tracy is an amazing professor. She is clear and is honest. Don't make her mad, not good!! Attend class and do what is required you should be good! Her class is easy!! She's a nice professor!!",1
"If this class wasn't mandatory for Pre-Vet students, then I would recommend not taking it. Lectures were extremely bland and tough to sit through. In fact, there's really no point in going since all the lectures are recorded and posted online. The exams were not difficult, however, they do require that you memorize ALOT of information.",1
Davidovitch is an absolutely useless incomprehensible teacher with no ability to help his students with anything.  THe way he teaches is impossible to learn from without memorizing every single thing he says. But the thing is you can't understand a single thing he says or writes because of his horrible spelling and accent. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!!,0
"super scatter minded... jumping from topic to topic, though he reviews at the beginning of every lecture, a lot of times the material fail to match up: either he made mistakes last lecture, or during his review. studying for final is hard because the material is everywhere. he's always willing to help, but taking good notes is impossible.  ",0
"Do not expect full credit on anything, even when it is deserved. She is a tough teacher who treats you like professional journalists. If you are anything BUT a journalism concentrator, do not take this class anyway. Find something else. I would not recommend taking her, she doesn't teach at all. No tests or quizzes, just articles and blog project.",0
Overall the worst professor i have ever had. His class is extremely boring and he does not know how to teach. The work is a lot and he does not have office hours for help nor provides help in class.,0
Hard class. A lot of studying will give you a C.,0
"Jimmerson is a very caring and dedicated English professor. As a biology major, I hate English but I managed to get an A in the class. You have to try your hardest on everything you turn in to her because she takes off for every little error. With that being said, she does give a little bonus and is very willing to help outside of class.",1
"This class was really great. Weekly reading, lectures, an extra assignment of some kind, and a discussion post with two replies. If you do the work, you will get an A. Li is nice and gives weekly follow-ups on the content from the last week to make sure you understand the whole point of the assignment. Would highly recommend.",1
Excellent teacher. Very helpful and keeps class engaged. Projects are fun and very informative. Picky grader but extremely fair. Put time and effort into assignments and you wil do well,1
"Although the class content is interesting, much of what is learned is never on the exams. This is further complicated by the fact that Alvaro is a lazy condescending prof who acts like a know it all but is unavailable to answer questions both in and outside class.",0
Very good breadth choice. Easy if you go to class and take notes.,1
"Could be a great guy outside of class, but as a professor he can be very arrogant. Constantly acknowledges it's a sophomore level class, yet expects senior level answers. Think there is no such thing as a 'dumb' question? There is to him and he will call you out on it in front of the whole class. Switch professors if you can!",0
"Funny guy, but the workload is pretty heavy. There is a spike in difficulty in the middle of the quarter as you tackle LISP and PROLOG assignments. Three weekly quizzes and a consistently tough homework assignment makes this class challenging, but they aren't worth much of your grade-- feel free to skip the harder ones if you just want to pass.",1
"Terrible professor. Vague understanding of concepts so doesn't really explain the answer. Laughs when students catches him on mistakes and says ""I was planning that"". Tutorial was awful because T.A didn't answer questions. He gave vague answers in office hours as well. Midterm wasn't too bad. Often times comes late and does 2.5 hour classes.",0
"I couldn't understand the course - no help was given linking the lessons to the textbook, and no direction or assistance was given. I had to wait 7 days for a response about the midterm, with only 2 weeks to go before the exam.",0
"impossible to study for his exams, but good prof. You would get the same grade wether or not you study.",0
This class was a lot of fun and Tim-sensee is awesome. Very easy to talk to - in English and in Japanese. One of my favorite teachers at UAB.,1
"visited during office hours and was rude, not helpful at all",0
Marshall Battani is one of the worst Sociology Professors at GV. He is not accessible outside of class. Grades heavily on the papers and always gives you 5% less than you actually should be getting. Don't take this Professor!,0
"Besemer seems cool at first, but she's actually just rude and should not be a professor whatsover. She also showed up about 15 minutes late to every class.",0
"If you come to class and are engaged in the material, you'll do wonderfully. The lectures are great for an intro-level philosophy class and if you're confused about anything or have any interesting tangential thoughts about the material, he'll explain things and help you explore ideas if you visit his office hours",1
"Didn't really like him. I'm minoring in history and am really passionate about it, but it wasn't really engaging at all. lectures were really boring, LOTS of daily HW. gave us a great outline for the midterm though, without it I would've failed. he's a sweet guy, but I wouldn't take it again. many like him though so who knows. kinda dryyyy",0
"Al-Saji was a very good instructor. Go to class, read the textbook, and you will easily get an A. He can be a little hard to understand but if you put in the work you will have no problems on tests. The only students he disrespected were the ones who disrespected him or the class first.",1
If you have the opportunity you need to take prof. Ernst she is amazing. By far my favorite prof. at Loyola.,1
"Aweomse prof, made everything so interesting and uses great examples that help you recall info for exam. He has quite a few mid terms throughout the year on 1-3 chapters so he keeps you on your toes which is great when it came to the final exam! My favorite psyc prof at X",1
"Very unclear in what he wants from students. His schedule and syllabus he uploads are contradicting. He is unorganized, confusing and like many said, condescending. Pretty positive he hardly updates class materials/schedule/etc. assigns assignments/quizzes/midterm but will cancel them quietly even though students have completed them.",0
"Very boring and long lectures, gives homework that is not interesting at all and makes you not want to draw. doesnt ever give As on homework",0
"This class wasn't the best, but definitely an easy A if you show up to class and listen to the lecture. There is a quiz once a week, but she tells you exactly what is going to be on it the class before at the end of the lecture, so make sure you come to class. A summary for homework every week on a chapter and a few follow-up activities.",1
I don't recommend taking her class because she is not an organized person. She has no idea how to use canvas and never writes anything down so it's hard to know what the main points of the lectures are. But the worst part is she never goes over any material that is taught or readings so you have no idea what you are going to be tested on.,0
"Good professor, can be a bit of a jerk, but fair exams and interesting lectures",1
"Took him because heard it was an easy A, Yeah no. the class was online because of covid and he had quizzes before every class over the chapter books you have to read (2) with no time to take it and lockdown browser. the tcharts and presentation were hell to do and he graded very hard. How do you expect us to present 15 minutes about baseball?",0
"Multiple times couldn't solve basic circuits in class, test solutions were sometimes incorrect, and do not expect him to grade fairly at all. ",0
"Mildly passive-aggressive in class, but willing to explain some topics again when asked. Tests are poorly designed (typos, repeated questions & confusing phrasing). Was appointed to instruct my class at the last moment, so not entirely her fault. Generally interested in student learning, though lectures are not always useful.",1
try get his past exams it will help you ace the class,1
"The change from high school english to the university level is much harder than expected and in my opinion, she did not do a good job with the preparations. Boring, hard to listen to sometimes, somewhat opinionated. She is a good person at heart though, and you will see that very quickly in the class. Does give help if asked. Do not call after 10. ",0
"Terrible teacher. Gives no notes, no explanations, no anything. You can clearly tell that he hates to answer your questions. Just does examples on the board the whole entire class. Would not recommend this teacher to anybody that struggles with Math.",0
"Dr. de Koning is very straightforward with her lectures. I cannot stress how much attendance matters. The questions she has on her exams are come right from her lectures, so make sure you organize your notes.  If you would like to survive her class, it is necessary that you: MAKE FLASHCARDS! FORM A STUDY GROUP! ASK QUESTIONS! And, Good-luck!",1
Prof. Silvia is really nice yet he can give ALOT of homework which can be overwhelming. I took a hybrid class for him and he will hand out ALOT of in class and lecture packets. Be prepare to get 15-20 assignments online and note packets due by next class. He's very hard on grading if you have a 77% or 79% he won't round it!,0
"Mrs. Vasquez is an outstanding teacher. I learned a lot from listening to her lectures. Her teaching style is based on power point lectures and great points of interest throughout history. She connects well with the students and is very sociable and likeable. As a history fan myself, I would love to take any of her available classes to learn more.",1
She was  an awesome teacher.,1
"Great Prof! Funny and charismatic! Work on weekly assignments ahead of time. Midterm and Exam MC. No textbook, but has great slides and many websites to keep you updated on current info. Pay attention in class, words and stats are important. Participate and ask questions. He will answer questions better then you imagine, can ask exam questions too!",1
"Phil's econ class is a lot of interesting lectures and examples, but he gets the point across well. I really liked his class and definitely would recommend it. Friday tests tho, which are 5 questions and honestly not too bad just because he drops 5 of them at the end of the semester.",1
2 essays. 3 Online exams. 1 in class final worth 20% of your grade. You have to go to class to pass. Takes attendance. Weights everything in his class. And is very anal in the way you have to use the course site. WOULD TAKE ONLINE!!!,0
"Professor Tulin is amazing. He tells you exactly what you need to know, but it takes time to adjust to the type of memorization and regurgitation that he expects on tests/essays. He is always available outside of class, and is really knowledgeable so talk to him. First 2 absences are free, takes away a full percentage point for each one after.",1
"Professor Stark really knows his stuff, there is no doubt about it. However, at times he can come off as a bit condescending and not very approachable. He is a pretty tough grader but you will learn a lot in his class, although at times lectures will seem a bit overwhelming and dry.",1
Awsome Instructor while I was there.  Went through ROTC with him at the same time....easy class.,1
"Since most students know little about the Middle East, he lectures more in this class than others. Assigned a 10-page informational essay and two 5-page. Covered long period of time and had lots of interesting highlights. Typical Stewart lectures with sarcasm and a couple questions. Did not make it all the way to the present... ended around 1980s.",1
"Dr. Aktas is a decent lecturer, when it comes to exams, please study the example problems inside and out. There have been cases where students don't show up to class and miss quizzes. Show up to class and also know your proofs. His favorite example problems are proofs. Know that what most of what you will learn comes from example problems.",0
Mr. Hafey is a great professor. I have never been good in math and he makes sure you fully understand and even teaches different way for those of us with ADD. If you ever have the opportunity to have him as a professor make sure you sign up for his class.,1
He refuses to use Canvas or email so contacting him outside of class is a hassle. He rarely takes time to explain the lessons so he almost expects you to know what he's doing. It's honestly easier to learn from the textbook than from his lectures. His tests seem simple but his grading makes it difficult. Just horrible and difficult.,0
Professor Gilbert gave us lots of homework and never graded it in a timely fashion. It wasn't until the day of the final when I was finally getting feedback on homework I submitted 2 months prior. My peers and I sent endless emails obtaining our questions regarding the homework and we never got responses. We didnt do work since it won't get graded.,0
I would not recommend him as a professor. Avoid him. He is rude. We are tested on things we haven't gone over in class yet. Information in unclear gives us an idea of what to expect on quizzes and half of the stuff isn't even on there. Worse class ever.,0
Very unclear on what he wants. His notes are a mess (he doesnt believe in making power points or a pdf for students). Told us the exam was going to be open book and 2 days before the test changes it from being open book to closed book as well made it a proctored test when it wasnt supposed to be. Makes it unclear as what he expects from students.,0
"I liked her. But now, I love her and Microbial Ecology. Her passion for this field is contagious. There are few opportunities to get easy grades while exams are the usual toughness and group project was the usual easy-going. It is fundamentally important to do what she says; i.e. Read articles she assigned. Makes life easier.",1
Professor McDonald is an amazing professor who always kept learning about biology fun and interesting. She cares less about a students ability to memorize terminology and instead emphasizes hands on learning experiences. If you're looking for a class that will not only make you a better biologist but also a better and more confident person take her,1
"do not take him, he is very argent",0
Professor Chistensen is the best English Professor at Florida Memorial University. He is great. Upon leaving his class your writing skills will improve tremendously. Keeep doing what you are doing Professor Christensen,1
"Learned nothing from his class. He is a terrible professor because he doesn't even try to help you learn or give any advice about careers or the industry. He's the opposite of Bryce, who actually teaches real world applications of finance. Haltiner just drones on about useless theories he copies from the text, and he's completely useless.",0
"Won't stop complaining about students not doing the readings due to a shy class. His assignments are murky at best and frustratingly annoying. Ex identifying a victim of the Holocaust by giving the information that they were 1) born in Poland 2) female. I have always excelled at primary source analysis, but he just leaves me seething in rage.",0
"Peter is a funny guy. He's entertaining to talk to outside of class. But his lectures are dry and boring.  His tests are not overly easy. There are easy, mildly fun in class assignments for points on random days. He doesn't give many homework assignments, but the ones he does give are time consuming. He gives Extra Credit out like nobody's business",1
"I learned a good amount and her classes are not super hard, just make sure you study well for her tests.",1
"Easy class, do all the written requirements and you will get a B. Online quizzes super easy",1
"I went to her office hours, asked a valid question, and then laughed at me in front of my classmates. The class itself isn't hard, the issue is her. I can't tell you how many times I've woken up on a Sunday morning to an email saying we have a pre-lab quiz due that night. I would call myself a very capable person, but Vanderhoning makes 0 sense.",0
"He is a beautiful creature and incredibly nice! He's very clear with his explanation and encourages everyone to engage with each other hence why it's a Marketing course. I just didn't like how we needed to group ourselves the 2nd class because we hardly knew anyone but it is a good way of exercising networking skills. Also, doesn't post his notes.",1
"Make sure that you read the books for his class. He will ask you in-depth questions from the reading materials. If you haven't read, he will definitely humiliate you in front of the whole class!!!",0
He's a sweetheart. Always willing to help with assignments and is generous with his grading. Lectures are entertaining and keep me on the edge of my seat although the material can sometimes be dry. His beard is inspiring. ,1
Best Electrical Engineering Professor at UNCC. Take whatever course he offers. Be prepared to  put in LOTS of effort for Network Theory I and II.,1
No comments...worst class ever o.0,0
"Avoid this course. -The exams aren't limited to the learning objectives. What's the point of the learning objectives is, if not to focus studying? -Exams focus more on memorization than on conceptual understanding. -The textbook is custom, with chapters from different books. This sucks if a chapter refers to a page we don't have access to.",0
"Her classes seem hard, but they are actually very easy.  There is a lot of reading, but most of it is unneccesary to get a good grade.  I only did have of it but got an A+, also the final was optional.",1
Fantastic guy!,1
"Dr. Bates is extremely helpful and interesting, but you need to go to her for the greatest amount of help. If you are struggling, she will do everything to make sure you get a good grade in her class. DON'T SLACK OFF, because she does expect a lot, and rightfully so.",1
"This is my second time taking this course and Prof Adams is the sole reason that I'm passing. If you put in the effort to learn the material (go to class, go to office hours, do the hw), he's more than willing to help you out. He grades on how you improve throughout the year, not necessarily the grades you get on exams. Super great guy!",1
Professor Heyrman is such an amazing professor. She cares about her students and makes US History so much more interesting. She engages the class by reading about 5 or 6 novels and not a boring textbook. She also understands that we are going through alot and makes the class college-leveled but as easy as possible for you to pass. YOU MUST TAKE HER,1
"Easy and BORING. He just talks and talks and talks, then puts on a boring film. I literally went to two classes all semester. I did all the work, and still received a B. I wouldn't recommend this class, but it's an easy A/B to help the GPA.",0
TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE...worst professor I've ever had.  So rude...has her favorites before you even speak and treats you like your 12.  I absolutely cannot stand her!  Do not take her class she is soo boring...straight reading from the book...like do I really need to come to class to hear you read?  HATE HER AND HER CLASS! AVOID!,0
Teaford is the Best Professor you will Ever Have.  I took his class 3 years ago and to this day I feel the need to let the world know what an amazing experience a class from Teaford is.  If every teacher were like him we would have a country full of PH.D.s for sure.,1
LAME.,0
"Karen cares a lot about her students. If you ask, she will often be willing to explain and help you as best as she can. PLAN210 is all about group work, and you need to hope you aren't paired up with clowns, as her assignments take a huge amount of work. Overall, good prof teaching a demanding course, I did not attend lecture but labs are mandatory",1
Do not take his class. you will die. awful does not begin to describe this man.,0
"She's a very sweet woman to talk to as a friend but not as a teacher. In the beginning of class we would just talk, then go through the presentation, and then somehow land up talking about her life again. If you want to pass, you have to take a lot of notes, but honestly, its hard when her talking makes you want to curl up and go to sleep.",0
"Dr. Feagin Is THE BEST professor at GHC. Her online class is a breeze, the tests are word for word what the study guide is, and she is always available to help her students. 10/10 would take again!",1
"Andronis is a pretty smart guy and has had quite a bit of experience. He is really unorganized and doesn't update his syllabus. Make sure to ask him about everything listed on it. If not you may end up finding out that a have a ten page paper to write the day before it is due. Pretty funny, but some references are obscure. Likes to repeat himself.",0
Don't suggest taking this class if you don't have to. His tests are hard- most of the answers come between 2 that could be correct. Even if you study your butt off there's always a chance you'll do horribly. Sure he curves it but not by much. Don't take this class.,0
Great Teacher! I had her for microbio and human anatomy! She is very helpful! I learned so much! The classes were really fun!,1
"He is a great and interesting teacher, but his tests and quizzes are really hard. But he is hilarious and makes history (my least favorite subject since 5th grade) interesting!",1
"He get's side tracked often and doesn't ""teach"" much Half of the class dropped before the drop date because he never gave told us our grades and was never available outside the class Homework heavy but don't except him to tell you when it is due or even how to work the website because he doesn't know how to use the website at all although it is req",0
"I've never failed a course until I took this class. I know at least 6 others who failed, and not for lack of trying either. Early in the term I expressed concern for my grade, and he just told me to drop the class, pick another major. He grades tests and essays on an unbelievably hard scale.  I no longer even want to major in psychology.",0
"Great professor!  He will challenge you.  He presents difficult ideas clear and effectively.  Be prepared to put a lot of time into this course if you want to do well.  There is no time to think on exams, so be a machine by at solving the problems.  The homework is time consuming, and the exams are a level above the homework.",1
She's great! She's hilarious and fun. The class is really easy if you put the work in and read the textbook. She's pretty fair.,1
Wants her own ideas regurgitated back at her and nothing else.,0
This class is not bad at all. He writes down everything that he thinks is important on the board as he goes over it in class. Take good notes and that will be the ultimate study guide for the test. There are no surprises with his tests and he usually offers some extra credit questions on there. It is tempting to skip lectures but don't.,1
"Very lively, like a cup of coffee in the morning",1
She was always all over the place while lecturing and it was hard to follow example problems that she did in class. The content wasn't too bad but the exams were quite challenging.,0
"He's the coolest! I had absolutely no interest in anthropology; only took it to fill content areas. But his enthusiasm and charisma made me actually look forward to lectures. While I wouldn't want to pursue the subject further, now I get why people are interested. The tests do tend to be a bit trickier than you'd expect, though.",1
"Excellent prof, conveys material well. Didn't do very well in his class but that was my fault.",1
Youssou is the bomb! I STRONGLY recommend his class :):),1
William Virgil Davis' contribution to me as a professor was life altering. It is in his classroom that I learned critical thinking and gained the capacity to look beyond the surface of the material and coalesce new thought. I will be forever grateful to him for the effect he has had on my life,1
I took him this semester and he says he will respond to emails within 24 hours but Ive emailed him about a project days before it was due and he didnt respond until after it was already turned in. Also he doesnt keep up with grading and you wont really know if you passed the class or not until its basically too late. Will never take again.,0
"Professor Dendy is an amazing professor. However, she is not easy. If you want to actually gain something from this class instead of getting an easy A, take her. She is very caring and truly does want to see her students succeed.",1
"This instructor does not care about his students at all. He does not focus on what a student learns, he focuses on how well you cite your responses like if you were taking a Masters's class when you should be learning about computers. He teaches like 10 classes at Tarleton and you would think that he is the only BCIS employed there.",0
"Avoid, avoid, avoid. Incredibly unclear on what's expected on assignments. Furthermore, stuck in the Stone Age in regards to class materials. Relies completely on textbook, lecture is completely verbal so you better take good notes or you're done for, and no use of Nexus for anything. Overall, not helpful, confused/babbly lectures, and unclear.",0
If you have to take this course take it with this guy. He doesn't have the greatest personality but I hardly put in any effort and got a better grade than a C. Don't challenge or question him though. Book use was minimal.,0
"She was one of the worst French professors I've ever had.  I put more effort into this class than I should have, because I definitely didn't get anything out of it.   I don't recommend take this class with her.",0
Dr. Vega is a very nice person. However he should not be teaching. His lectures seem to lack structure and are so bad that I no longer even try following. He is well known for putting trick questions in his homework assignments and tests. I am a good student. I have gotten A's and B's in all of my upper division psych courses. I do NOT recommend.,0
"Beware of this guy. His presentations in class are ""okay"", but if you get to an assignment and you can't figure it out, well tough luck. He also takes off grades if you do not show your explanation for questions (even if they are simple math questions).",0
"The only things you'll learn from her is worry and discouragement. Get rid of this teacher immediately, if you are unluckily assigned to her class. The way she teaches is not helpful at all, but she thinks she is very professional teacher.",0
"This is a very difficult class, especially if you had no French experience in high school. Do your homework, do her little extra research projects and extra credit assignments.  Try really hard to practice speaking French (you never practice in class, only get graded in class). This class will become your life.",1
"Currently taking a class with her and she is very difficult. Reading is mandatory. I have tried to study in many different ways but never really getting the grade I want. If possible, take another professor.",0
He really knew the material and was passionate about it. He also required a lot which helped push me and helped me really learn the material.,1
She's a good professor. Im taking her again whenever I get the chance.,1
"He was sick the first few weeks of school so he made our first test open book and open note. Then he made the second test open book and open note and all of our quizzes have been open book and open note. Overall, if you listen to the lectures you'll pass. Also bring your book to class because he wont warn you in advance about open note quizzes.",1
"Posts lectures on OAKS, but they make no sense unless you go to class. Tests are off the study guides, but some of the questions are not covered in the lecture, only covered in class verbally. He gets side tracked very easily and personally very difficult for me to learn off the way he speaks",1
He's not a bad teacher but I didn't really learn anything from him that a couldn't have from the book. If you ask questions he knows his stuff but just make sure you ask them! Overall not a bad class. A little boring just do the homework assignments and have your papers read by someone who has taken philosophy before.,1
literally the worst teacher ever do not take him if you want to understand what you're teacher is saying he has a very thick accent. when asked a question like why would you do this in a math problem he wouldn't understand the question. A 54 was a C which says ALOT about how awful of a teacher he is,0
Boring and dry. Avoid if possible.,0
"professor lewis is possibly the most useless professor i've had at mary washington thus far. i'm almost completely fluent in spanish, so the class itself wasn't hard, but completely pointless. it's like a highschool class, and i feel like she can't speak spanish fluently herself.",0
Attending this class felt like agony. Prof spent less than 10% of the class actually talking about what we were supposed to be reading. Easy grader but his pedagogic strategy is all over the place. Would make up excuses so he wouldn't have to grade assignments. If you care about learning at all DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS.,0
just study hard,1
"I took this 200-level class for as a Gen Ed credit, and it was one of the most difficult courses of my academic career. Attendance isn't mandatory, but it's not like a perfect attendance will guarantee you an A. His tests are nearly impossible and many students didn't know what they were getting in to. Hard to take notes considering he rambles.",0
"He is a nice guy... But, unfortunately he does not teach anything that you will be tested on. He claims that he is teaching to help you for a future in marketing. However, his activities and slides were irrelevant and unhelpful. I wish he brought in guest speakers and taught some of the processes from the dense textbook. ",0
"This guy cant reach past the mid point of the board. after the first week, he stopped writing on the board and started giving incomplete notes. He's absolutely awful, crappy marker, very c0cky and just a terrible prof to have for thermo. He will put you off the subject for good.",0
"Yue Laoshi has an amazing ability to instill in her students a high regard for and robust understanding of the Chinese language and culture. She takes care to address the learning needs of each and every student and is always accessible. Class is fun, so going to class does not feel mandatory despite the attendance policy. The work is manageable.",1
"The worst professor ever in NC state. He doesn't teach, and he's not organized at all. Try to avoid him whatever costs you!!!!",0
"I thought Dr. Edwards was a great professor and I hate biology.  Yes, you should read the textbook, but it's college so you should be doing this anyways. Come to class because she used the same phrases while teaching as she does on tests! :)",1
"He is a really effective, interesting lecturer. He makes you want to go to class which is also a must because you need to fill in blank slides and there is no textbook :) An easy course if you go to class and now your stuff :)",1
Very biased on whom he teaches.  If you not a member of IEEE be careful! He will ignore you and treat you like you don't know anything.,0
"She is a very intelligent professor and teaches unique ways how to write a paper. However, she only had the class out of 100 points and a 91-100 was an A. I am a 4.0 student and got my first B in this class. Very hard grader on essays (only 5.) Not doing the readings and posting discussions would only count against you, not for you. ",0
He is all over the place and sometimes he just rants. No structure in the class and the way he teaches. We spent over 3 weeks going over 1 assignment! He is approachable and is willing to help. I can't say I've learned a lot in his class. he falls behind on his lectures and assignments and rushes everything at the end.,0
"If you have to take a math class just to get it out of the way, might as well take it with this guy.  He makes class enjoyable by cracking really lame jokes, but other than that it's just powerpoints.  Most of your points come from tests, but they're take-home, which is good because the material is hard and confusing.  Notes are posted online.",1
"Look, Logan is a very nice guy, but he's SO quiet and slow, that the class was so painfully boring to sit through. He got really behind because of how slow he is, so the last couple of days of class were insane. He's a poor planner, as our last test was on the last dat of class, and the following Monday was the final. I hated this class.",1
No other professor on campus has such a visible love for life and his students.,1
"Attend Class, read and listen, and then ask questions(David will answer all questions thoroughly/Stays after class to help students). You need to be prepared for the critical thinking required for college in order for David to help you do well. He does not spoon feed students.",1
"Quentin is an entertaining and witty intellectual. Although he can be intimidating, his exams are fair as is his grading. Great UCSC professor.",1
"THE MOST HORRIBLE CLASS EVER TOOK. He's really boring and doesn't help you on the quizzes, and makes you do a  useless group projects. He reads off the power points. He doesn't use  Canvas to grade the work, but it is through SAM.  Answers from the quizzes are not from the book so wouldn't recommend to read the book look it up from a different sour",0
"The worst online instructor I've had. Expect lots of point deductions with no explanation. He contributed nothing to the class. In fact, he in no way enhanced my learning, he just hindered it. Very disappointing.",0
"One of the best teachers I have ever had. Very intelligent man who encouraged process thinking. Hard maybe, but very fair. Do the work, show the effort and he will give you an A.",1
Lots of homework as usual but he is very helpful when you are asking questions.  Tests are medium difficulty.  Would recommend to non-math majors as well as math majors.,1
"The course itself is very challenging but Ross tries his best to make sure you understand. His humour keeps the lectures interesting. Go to his office hours if you need help, he really cares for his students and will do his best to help you succeed.",1
"Tries to make the material harder than what it really is. Gives absolutely no guidance on what material we should concentrate on, especially for physio lab. My advice: take Cognition lab!",0
"The professor is so so so so nice that some of the students fall in love with him. He is smart, nice, funny and hot!!",1
"100 slides copy-pasted from Wikipedia and elsewhere. there's time for about half, but who cares: there's no apparent structure, he produces nothing but truisms and mainstream opinions, no critical approach at all. In international politics! Don't email with criticism, he won't respond. I grant, it's an easy A. Hardest part is to stay awake",0
She is a great Professor and very lively. She is kind and wants the best for her students. she is also very fashionable.,1
Very very very boring mandatory lectures.,0
"She gave us allot of homework, mostly she giving us 20 questions a day. Also, when she do grade the exams, she deduct allot of the points for small mistakes, like if a student wrote 2.89 instead of 2.9 she take high percentage of the points of the question. Also, for the final exam she gave us only one hour to solve 15 questions, which is not fair.",0
"good person, seems unorganized",0
"Ronet is, by far, one of the best professors I have had at UD. She makes class fun because she is very witty and kind of scatter-brained. If you take this class with anyone else you will regret it!",1
"If you want an A in her class, you have to do the work. There is a lot of assigned reading in this course, and you have to actively participate in discussion modules. The quizzes were not easy, but not overly difficult. If you review before hand, you will be fine. She is very nice, and provides great feedback to help you with future assignments.",1
His jokes are hard to understand if you are not American. Always bring the objective learn to class and ask if you do not understand. study that and you will get A.,0
"Easy compared to other Bio professors.  Not the most entertaining lecturer but all the notes for the test are written on the board. She's a little awkward, but she means well. Tells jokes every Friday (she thinks they're funny). I would take her again.",1
Dr. Crawford is a good teacher and the only reason I got a B was my own fault. He goes over tons of practice problems during class so you don't want to miss. He is really nice and will answer all the questions you have. He also gives real life examples to help you grasp the concept better.,1
Geoff is a very disorganized prof who knows very little about the projects he assigns. The course load is heavy and TAs mark everything. We are several weeks behind because Geoff spends more time reminiscing on his business life than teaching. Haven't even touched textbooks.,0
He has no remorse. Doesn't teach anything. He just pre-records lectures and makes you watch them on your own time. Every class you have a quiz first thing and then he asks you if you have any questions on the new topic you were suppose to watch for the week. Simply you have to teach yourself calculus 2 while he watches you struggle.,0
"DO NOT RECOMMEND. She is an extremely tough grader. And is very nit-picky w/answers. Her powerpoints for the lectures are very confusing and didn't have a good flow throughout, they were very hard to follow and study. she gives quizzes every Thursday (worth 15 pt). she made us buy a mobile chem app (used only 12-15 times) and a HW website. AVOID.",0
"One of the best profs I've ever had. His notes and learning objectives are clear and really useful for tests. He doesn't use a textbook, he tests off of his learning objectives. Great class and great prof.",1
"Sobie basically just takes the entire book, writes every word onto a powerpoint and says good luck. His powerpoints cover way too much unnecessary material so theyre useless, exam reviews are 200 qs, but the exams are only 85. The exams are all too close to eachother to learn that much!! He also grades vaguely!! Do not reccommend!",0
"Inaccessible takes at least 3 emails to get a response, terrible organizational skills, the course this year was horrendous with insane expectations. Not enough time to express learning during tests. New venture was a nightmare with crazy expectations every week. Grading criteria get changed the day before stuff is due. Not the right fit for course",0
Woo Wise ROCKS!,1
"Worst learning experience. She has a lazy teaching style, referring to personal stories instead of educational material. If you ask her what chapter her lecture is on she will tell you she has no clue. The course is geared around her personal opinions, which are very dated. Is combative with students who have different views.",0
"Very good teacher, willing to work with students and will curve the tests grade. Come to class and labs, do the work and you will pass",1
"assignment instructions are never clear, on top of that, they involve the need for concepts we Never learned in class. never responds to emails",0
"Such an amazing professor! Her lectures are clear and office hours are very helpful. Do the homework and ask questions in class! Exams are challenging but she gives constructive feedback. This class is hard, but bearable.",1
"He does not go over prelab, he leaves the stuff on the counter tells you to read the manual with no direction. We weren't provided with the materials the lab manual states to use. When asked for help he just says ""read it"" repeatedly. Lectures are insufficient and criteria for what he wants is unclear. He had to curve his class very hard. Be warned",0
Worse Ever.  I wonder he even had a degree (which rumors say he failed his PhD defence - here you go). Doesn't know how to talk. Ruins the schools reputation <period>,0
not so great,0
"Honestly, if you just show up you'll get at least a B. Exams are online with no time limit, so you have like a week to google the answers. Only did 2 online posts about a current event. The rest of the grade came from in class work, which was super easy as long as you were in class. I didn't read a single thing from the book and did fine.",1
"I've been outside of school for nearly 10 years and while this course proved to be challenging at first, I grew to love it. Professor Lewan cares for her students. It's hard work and she can be a tough grader. If you take her feedback as constructive you'll become a better writer and student. Understandably, she's not a fan of repeat mistakes.",1
"Sheridan is a fantastic professor. He does expect a lot - there is a lot of reading and the lectures are heavy content wise. However, he does a great job clarifying what you may need help with and if you put in the work, you will do just fine. Taking him again in the fall and I am so excited.",1
"He was a nice prof. However, he is very critical in terms of marking. Very very hard marker for the essays. The perks of the course was that there was a take home exam. You should attend all lectures and understand the material to do well in the course. There are a lot of readings.",1
HIGHLY RECCOMMEND HIM. I was nervous about taking chemistry in college because I didn't enjoy it in high school but Professor Louters made it very bearable. He is a great lecturer and loves answering questions/getting to know his students. This class is challenging and you must study hard for weekly quizzes and for the tests if you want to do well.,1
I took her as a freshman back in 2003. At the time I didn't realize how bad she was at teaching and gave her a positive review. But i've been a full time professor for six years and reflected on my education and realized that she was one of my worst instructors. She's not a good speaker and not particularly intelligent while being condescending.,0
"If you have a lot of time to go check the moon everyday lol or go check the sunset everyday then get him. And if you have a lot more time for take home mini essays and paperworks get him. But if not, dont. He loves his job but doesnt think about his students. That his students are college students that have other stuff to do+not detaild when teachn",0
"As an English teacher, her English really sucks.",0
"Weekly quizzes based on 50+ page articles that use ""old language"": hard to understand. Really needs to change his method of teaching, lectures can be a hit or miss - really interesting or really boring. He's a really nice guy, but he has high expectations. Only graded based on the weekly quizzes and three long essays, doesn't offer extra credit. Eh",1
This class was interesting and touched on some topics that may be a little difficult/heavy for some and she does give this disclaimer at the beginning of the course. There was a group project and we did have the opportunity to grade our group members at the end of the course. I am not a fan of group projects but it went well. I'd take her again.,1
"Efa is my fave. He basically just lectures off of his slides and tells his own personal stories, which help to understand the material. He stepped up his tests this semester, so you actually have to study, but as long as you read the textbook, and write notes in your own words, you'll do fine. Participation is also worth 20% of your overall grade.",1
Professor Schleiniger is a super nice guy and wants everyone to do well. His lectures can be confusing because he jumps between boards and mixes theorems and proofs in the middle of his examples. Midterms were fairly easy but I felt super unprepared for the final given its difficulty.,1
"Extremely difficult, the course title accurately describes the class: World in Crisis; or better put by Dr. Durham, himself: Your World in Crisis. Very informative class, enjoyed it a lot despite its difficulty and depressing topic. Although I differed with him opinion-wise, he never marked my grade down due to a differing opinion.",1
He is super funny and tries super hard to keep the class fun and informative. Had him at 8am and he still made it bearable. Cool guy and would suggest taking him for the required UI100 class.,1
"Patty Hayden-Roy is pretty much the man. He gives too many writing assignments, but other than that he's a good teacher. You'll always get a laugh from his awkward lectures.",1
Dr. Krell is a very inconsistent grader.  He can be very hard on papers and other times he can be very easy.  I turned in one paper where I used a particular format for citations and got a great grade with no comments.  I used the same on a second paper and he tore it up and gave me much worse grade.  His message board posts are all over the place.,0
So easy to work with,1
"Being a writing intensive class, be prepared for at least a one page responses once a week. It isn't bad, but towards the end of the semester when you have 50 other papers due the same time, it can feel like it adds up. Very great lectures, interesting content. I hope I have the opportunity to take another class.",1
His lectures are boring but when you get him going off on a tangent its hilarious. He will talk to you about woodworking forever if you let him. Overall good teacher though.,1
scariest teacher ever. Don't even bother asking questions because she makes you feel stupid for even asking them. Her course is extremely challenging and she doesn't let you go to the bathroom.,0
"Easily the worst class I have taken here so far. The class is college level difficulty, but it's structured like a high school course. You're left completely in the dark about what your grade is the whole way through. Acts like her class is the only class worth worrying about. Group project is long and somewhat hard. Strange attendance system. Bad!",0
Very unprofessional.,0
I absolutely loved having Professor Ippolito! We learned so much more than just how to give a speech! He really cares about each student and that is the first thing you will learn in his class. C.E.H.R. Be ready to learn all about that acronym!! He has a great way of teaching because he is more like your coach/mentor than your professor! Loved it!,1
She don't teach,0
"Very enthusiastic, but doesn't actually teach much",0
Wonderful teacher! Sympathetic to her students and listens to their suggestions. Best French teacher I've ever had.,1
"Not only did I think I would dread public speaking but at 7:30 am on Monday which is my one day off?  However, I will say I am so glad I took his class. I rarely looked at the time in his class because he made it interesting to be there. He allows you to pick your speech topics, making the possibilities endless. Mr. Carter really inspired me!",1
"A very bad professor. Slides, examples and explanations are ripped from the book and is incredibly rude to students in her class. Does not follow schedule, no syllabus given and exams/quizzes are not like the homework. Be prepared to the course coordinator or student advocate",0
"If you don't care to learn, don't pick this teacher because he will help you learn. Great teacher. A lot of work, quizzes and essays. All the work will make you smarter, but it can be too much.",1
"Great teacher, very helpful. You need to really study though, because she goes through stuff pretty fast. You need to keep up and know the material. Only thing that kind of sucks is the online homework. Nadeau is hilarious.",1
I dont usually do this but this guy is just too soft spoken to be a professor. You can hardly hear anything he says.,1
"Wow. okay so her syllabus says ""dont embarass yourself by asking me for extra credit"" first of all what is so wrong in trying to better in school? NOTHING. 2nd, her exams are horrible and confusing as well was vague. answers to many questions can be debated. you HAVE to come to class to fill in blanks, in short - DONT TAKE HER CLASS.",0
"Jim is a great person and this class opens your mind too much more views and opinions. No one really knows what you are graded on for this class, but if you do the papers and come to class you will be fine. Make sure you speak up in class, it makes it so much better. I enjoyed this class and learned a lot about the topic.",1
Very unorganized and not helpful at all. English is my best subject and I made a C in his class. He also messed up my grade and when I emailed him about it he never replied. I took it online maybe in person he is better.,0
"Dr Crane is an amazing and inspirational lecturer. His lectures are amazing but they do not tie with what will be on the test. This class you are only grade by 3 test (1st is 20% of your final , 2nd is 30% of your final grade and the final is 50% of your overall score). This class is made to filter out comm majors. This is coming from an A student",0
This class is all massive amounts of busy work on things you had to teach yourself. Most classes were her giving random facts from her knowledge base that were only mildly related to the required content or going over the homework. Unrealistic expectations for most taking the class.,0
Worthless.,0
"Mr. Enright Sir is probably one of my favorite teachers ever, all though he does use a lot of sarcasm that some people might not like, I find him absolutely halarious! He is almost always down to help his students out and quite frankly his help does change a lot!",1
"One of the funnier profs, but most down-to-earth profs; stayed up to 2:50 AM before the final answering Piazza posts. He will answer questions with clarity and most of all, is down-to-earth(most approachable prof).",1
"Pro: -Leaves work on board -HEAVY CURVE Con: -Asks to solve a problem you've never seen before, spend 45 min on it, only to say question is ""bogus"" in the end -Each test has a 4 pg essay (Can't keep test) -Partial Credit. What is it? -Final unpassable, includes topics only in book -First grade submitted 1 week before final(ask prior, you're ""good"")",0
"Very old fashioned, doesnt know how to use canvas. You can tell he isnt used to large classes of people",0
One of the worst teachers I've ever had. ,0
"I hated his teaching. Hate is a strong word, but that's why I used it. He once spent a whole class (1hr45min) talking about his office, ways to get to his office, and mistakes students make while navigating to his office. No powerpoint. No weight to his words. NEEDS improvement.",0
Does a poor job at explaining concepts and makes evaluations over complicated without properly teaching the material.,0
"Most of his stuff is online, and he doesn't really teach anything in class. The only time I've learned anything is from the multitude of videos he shows. However, if you watch them and read all the stuff online, you will do well. The projects are in groups & not too hard. He doesn't teach anything specific, though, just talks about random stuff.",0
"Doctor Vician is so amazing. His class is so easy. He gives out a number of essays, but really really really easy to receive full point. There are 2 midterm essays which is unbelievably easy. TAKE HIS CLASS",1
Geoff is a great professor because he wants you to succeed and is genuinely nice. Class material is somewhat difficult but Geoff is fair and will give you a decent grade if he sees effort. The class is overall very fair and well designed.,1
"She would start to pick on random people, even if they were listening to see if they knew the material and would get upset if they did not. When analyzing a document everybody needed to see it the same way or they were wrong. There were no such things as a wrong answer here because she would get mad if you did not get the topic or was wrong.",0
this course is very tough. Don is really funny and great guy but not the best for finance. I worked my butt off and showed up to every class and the exam had a lot of stuff we didn't learn and a lot of students were very disappointed. the material needs to be reviewed for this class. makes you feel good about not doing the best lol,0
"Wonderful Prof. You can tell he loves his work. Warm/friendly, entertaining. Exams are 95% lecture-based, so you MUST go. Marks are 100% from the exam, and it's not essay format(I hate essays). It's Short / Long Answer questions he gives you beforehand. Grammar doesn't count, so it's just blabbing everything in your brain onto the paper. I love it.",1
She is one of the best. She is very helpful and clear with instruction as well as quick to respond to emails. The class has interesting discussion points and helpful power-points. She is seemingly equally as passionate about helping her students succeed as she is about the subject. I would take as many classes under this professor as possible.,1
Took this teacher for MTH112 (which is not hard at all) but this prof makes it sooo hard. Takes off points for dumb reasons that do not even affect the final answer. Always in a rush. Expects you to remember and know all the formulas like you're some kind of Math Wiz.,0
"Great teacher,  reallt knows his stuff, but is able to explain in an understanding manner",1
"Bruh, dark souls but no bonfires. Doesn't try to change the direction of the class to help the students but rather just to get on and get paid. Try to avoid at all cost.",0
"Neset Hikmet cares about work more than anything else. He has an extremely strong work ethic and expects the same of his students. His grading style is MORE than fair. As long as you aren't too far out in left field, and he sees that you put in a significant amount of effort, you WILL get an 'A'. He is also a brilliant and entertaining lecturer.",1
Parente is an atrocious professor who lies to his students to get them out of his hair if he cant explain something to you when you come for office hours. Hes a subjective grader so make sure he likes you or you wont do well.,0
"Wasn't terrible but wasn't teaching much. Gave us a midterm, we never take notes or use a textbook so, where'd she get those questions from? Who knows. Nice, loves marine biology but isn't ready for a teaching position just yet. Project heavy but they're all about going outside exploring which was cool but not for people who have jobs AKA 98% of us",0
"I think Dr. Ulak actually tries to be nice (?) She has made several student cry. You definitely don't want to have a bad first impression with her. Read the content she says to, when you are going through the material try to link the material. I'm not sure what else to say about Dr. Ulak's class.. Good Luck? or maybe choose a different professor.",0
"Bartee is awesome. She knows her material and is very organized. She never misses class, and answers every question you could have. She is easy going, tho she wants you to learn your material. I would take her again, and recommend you do the same.",1
"Professor incentives doing work by adding pointless ""bonus"" points that aren't really bonuses, you only get them by doing the work. I missed one 4 point assignment and got an F on the 15 point ""bonus."" Giving extra credit like that shouldn't be the incentive to do the work. It is unfair and doesnt teach anyone anything.",0
"Kelly rambles most of the class and his lectures are typically very boring. Most of the time no one would do the discussion papers. Sometimes he isn't clear with what he wants and he doesn't grade discussion papers with a rubric. Your grade will merely be what he felt it was. As long as you show up and are a decent writer, you can pass the class.",0
"She has a particular sense of humor, I love it! Her exams are not really representative of what she teaches in class, they're hard. She's not often at her office, but when you can get a hold on her, she's helpful.",1
"Physics is hard in general. Although it was hard to understand in class, you can't expect to learn everything from him. If you were to take him, be mentally prepared, view his powerpoints. If you really try you can pass with an A",0
she's the best!,1
"Madame Poindexter is extremely cute and lovable! Even if you have zero interest in this class you will love going bc she is so open, approachable, and encouraging. An excellent introduction to French by a native speaker.",1
"Professor just does example problems without explaining the material. The homework is optional, but this makes the class very test heavy since there is only 3 exams and the final. His tests are 5 questions for about 2-3 chapters of information. If you never took calculus before, do not take this class!",0
"This instructor was not very helpful and unapproachable. She insulted her students in front of the class leaving sine of is very disempowered. Unfortunately, she never provided the big picture of each lesson. No doubt she is a master in her field, but ability to convey this information and teach students how to apply it is unsatisfactory.",0
Judy is seriously one of the best profs I've had in my first year experience! She's helped me out so much in the course due to personal problems causing me to miss some stuff! She is super understanding and is willing to help you out as much as she is capable of. 10/10 recommend her!!! ,1
coolguy,1
"I love Professor Jaroff! Overall, she may come off as difficult but that is only because she wants you to say what you know and she pushes you. In terms of essays and grading she is super nice, easy, and helpful. I would definitely recommend to take her class because it is not too difficult, and makes class a lot of FUN!",1
"Hard class but the professor was available to help, provided valuable feedback, and returned grades quickly.",1
"Worst teacher ever way too demanding, thinks she is nice, but in reality there is nothing you can do in any of her classes to honestly earn a good grade (and we are talking even a B). Take her only if you feel like doing more work than the classes that actually matter and get graded the harshest you have ever been.",0
"I had Mcleod for ECON 102 and he was good for that. Would give us practice exams that were very similar to the exams. ECON 302 not so much, HWs were not too bad and like in-class examples, but his exams were different than some in-class examples and challenging. He also expects you to understand everything the first time you learn it no exceptions.",1
"I've had Levine for a few classes. She's a bit of an intellectual elitist and reads who you are from the first week of class, BUT her advice is honest and much informative. Just do the work, show interest, and visit her office.",1
"He is by far the worst professor I have had at GVSU. He assigns these preview activities on material we haven't even learned and grades it based on accuracy. He gives a lot of busy work and then does not really help when people ask questions. He is also a really tough grader. If you made a tiny mistake, he would mark the whole question wrong.",0
"There is a difference between this man and everyone else. Everything he says comes from his practical knowledge of the subject. The guy not only teaches it, but he lives it. If you want knowledge which can translate into real world success, this is your man. He is not easy, but well worth your time. I would pay just to listen to him speak.",1
She really teaches you to design and pushed your natural creativity. It is a shame many students try and take advantage of her supportive and kind nature. She doesn't let them get away with it thought! A gem to MU.,1
"This class requires work to pass. The only grades are 3 exams and a final. No extra credit but your highest grade is counted twice. If you do not study, do not expect to do well. Attendance is not mandatory but she did take attendance once. All lectures and power points are online. Overall, interesting class but I am an animal science major.",1
"Lectures where hard to follow. Would rather tell stories then teach. Classroom environment was awkward from day one. Doesn't use webworks, tough grader on handouts. Good luck getting grade updates.  Tests are tough; grades on a curve. Gives out bonus points in class for participating (don't really affect final grade). Don't recommend for MTH 122.",0
"Feedback on papers was on punctuation mainly, not content. We were writing proof arguments and I never really got feedback on my arguments, if they were weak, strong, well worded, etc. Also, the video put out for each lesson just went over the links in the lesson and showing us those, no insights in how to approach the lesson.",0
"A little sporadic, but was always available for outside help... Even left his cell number on the syllabus so we could get in touch with him for questions.",1
"Professor Samons loves the material that he teaches, and you can really tell during lectures. He conveys so much information in an hour, yet he manages to make it feel like a stand-up comedy routine rather than a history lecture. Hand down the best lecturer at BU and definitely one of the smartest. If you need to fill a requirement, he's your guy.",1
"Yvonne is the absolute worst professor in the Art Department. She doesn't trust that you are honest or dedicated, even if you show up and work hard in every class. Her assignment instructions are not instructions at all and her feedback is completely nonsensical. She will try to make your work fit her style instead of clearly outlining expectations",0
I took him in his first year teaching arc students and I have to say the best first experience as an architecture student I have yet to have. He cares so much about you and give great feed back and ideas for your projects. Much better than Bob. If you're lucky take this young man he is the GOAT.,1
"Dr. Fink is a really funny and great teacher.  his class is tough, but accounting is tough no matter who teaches it.  he really tries to help his students out and make things easier.  he also puts his notes online, and that helps out alot also.",1
He cares about his students a lot and spends a lot of time helping them and making sure everyone understands in each class period. The class isn't too hard and the homework is online which I really enjoyed. ,1
good lectures and fair grader,1
"Well lets put it this way. I got an A in the class. I didnt buy the book. I listened to her lectures and took some notes and thats about it. Just do the projects and put some effort into it. I never studied for tests but dont be fooled by that, just take notes during her lectures and you should be fine. Easy B/A :) Good teacher. Chill class, I advi",1
Every week there is a writing assignment.  He grades very hard unless you have the knowledge of a medieval historian.  The lectures are interesting but it is overshadowed by the amount of writing.,0
"UH, well Thrasher is a all right teacher.  The problems that she has is she gets to class late and keeps you late.  She also tries to put TO MUCH on tests. For real, there is only so much a human being can retain if they study 2 days ahead of time. ALSO, buying the book is a waist of money. We DON'T USE IT!",1
"To PSY350 - 12/28/2018 - Yes, the textbook is mandatory and yes testing centers around it mostly. Yes, in this course, in this version, you were required to have a webcam/audio recording and that was outlined in the course outline. Yes, some questions are repeated in quizzes and tests and is actually a good way to learn. Melanie, Your professor!",1
"She goes through material very quickly, without giving many examples. She basically expects her students to already understand what she hasn't taught. She does not grade homework so your entire grade depends on how you do on the tests and quizzes. She grades extremely hard, if you don't write out every step she doesn't give you credit for it.",0
"Quite honestly, shes only getting a 2 star because theres extra credit and a checklist of what you need to do. But with that being said, the weekly checklists consist of youtube videos and poor quality videos she makes at home that make basically zero sense. Shes an okay lady, but her ability to teach online is very subpar. Dont risk your time.",0
"Super nice and gives interesting lectures. She is very particular about assignments since she's also an editor, so definitely make sure you are familiar with MLA before taking her lit classes. Her grades are generous provided you read the material and make a good argument.",1
"Ridiculous woman.  Entirely too fascinated by herself, a sentiment you are guaranteed not ot share.  She will demonstrate her knowledge of Latin and Italian at least 15 times in each lecture, something no one else cares about at all.",0
"Terrible, does not help nor care. She never actually asks if you understand too much homework terrible teacher.",0
The PR LAb is an amazing experience!  I have been in it for a few years now and Dr. Matera really prepares you for a career in the PR world.  The students I have worked with have won countless awards along with received jobs as soon as they got out of college.  I really suggest you try this class if you want to do Public Relations,1
I miss this professor. Really wish he still taught here. I would sign up for his next class. Kind of makes you wish more professors were more passionate about their classes.,1
"Professor Tefera is a brilliant mathematician and I am astounded by his knowledge. That being said, he was unable to ""take it down a level"" and explain concepts for someone who was not knowledgeable in the content area. While Professor Tefera is a kind, wonderful person, I didn't learn anything from this course because he didn't explain well.",0
"He'd be fine for someone who is into reading, analysis, and writing detailed papers but I was really just out here tryna get my 102 credit. He's a good guy but his grading is pretty tough, his directions are so confusing, and you have to read so much of the textbook. So if you can, don't take him but if you're stuck it's not the end of the world.",0
"Boring, horrible class. Cook's a nice guy, but if you're looking to take Anthropology at Baylor, find another professor ASAP. Staying with that class all semester was torture.",0
"Took Hamilton for Math 246 Spring 2020 semester. His lectures are very fast and he rarely stops to take questions. If you miss one step it is impossible to catch up. It did not help when we switched to online classes because of the virus. Not sure how other professors are, but would not recommend his 246 class.",0
Intimidating as hell. Go to his office hours if you have any questions because Lord knows he never answer any one of my 15 emails...,0
Do not take her. You print off 28 to 40 pages of notes each lecture and she reads them straight from the projector and doesn't explain any of the concepts. She doesn't know how to break things down to help students understand it.,0
"Dr. Carina Pasquesi is a total badass! She walks into her class room and automatically receives respect from her students. She takes her time to explain any assignment, but she doesn't take over the class with lectures. If you love to talk, this is the class for you; the majority of the class are discussions about the readings! Take her !!!!",1
"Askay is the man! always a fun guy to have a conversation with and talk about the transcendence of philosophy with. If you put in the effort for the finals and listen to his lectures, you will do just fine in his class.  he will give you the answers of the finals and midterm questions if you finesse them out of him.",1
"Still uses moodle when we as students pay for D2L. Talks about himself like he is the the ""best."" The lectures are all over the place. He starts talking about one topic bounces around to another topic. Be prepared to be confused with his teaching methods very unorthodox.",0
"He provides all the info you need to do well on tests, except a select few that weren't discussed at all in class. He explains things well. Lectures are super boring though, lots of info in that course. Spent lots of time on photosynthesis and cell. resp. and barely was tested. find him a little rude in emails. also stood me up on an office apt.",1
"He is sweet, and accessible outside of class up to late the night before an exam. The exams are very similar to the practice exams, and homework is confusing and often has to be redone multiple times. But getting a B or and A is easily attainable.",1
"Hye-Shin Kim's teaching is very scatter-brained. She will ask you the same question at least once a day. She kind of rambles. She has a textbook; I would not recommend buying it. You don't need it. You have three group projects in the class, as well as two essay exams. It wasn't that hard of a class, but it kind of felt like a waste of time.",0
winter2021. The class was unorganized and schedule was messy and hard to read. Barely taught while giving a bunch of hw everyday. heavy accent. not tech savvy. felt as if the class wasn't prepared in advanced. spent half the class trying to reschedule the test and quizzes.,0
"Leonard is a good prof but to do well you have to go over your notes and re do the examples. She goes over material fast and Posts notes online but if you skip class youll have no idea whats going on. Her tests are fair compared to other profs with class averages around 60-65, Trevors classes were always around 50%. Get wize course for midterms",1
"Dr. Borg was a great professor, but his weekly quizzes became a lot and really affect your grade in the end. Both the mid term and final are essay questions that you must prepare and memorize in advance, but if you really study this class is not too hard.",1
"This was a relatively easy class. Chris Johnson is a very chill prof, assigns little work and exams are easy if you prepare, although he does want to see very specific things in the exam essays. Great lectures, awesome guy. My only complaints are that he is a lazy grader and will give you a B++ before he gives you an A.",1
"I have taken two classes with Ambassador Hare during my studies at BU. He is by far my favorite professor at BU. Although he assigns a substantial amount of reading, they are relevant and interesting. Highly recommend any class with him.",1
"She makes me believe in a better world. Granted, I am an ENS major, but Dr Farris is my heart and soul. SHe will accomodate you and lets you have up to 5 unexcused abscenses. Easy A if you put in the work. AMazing woman.",1
Extremely helpful and professional.,1
Taking chem 263 with Clive made me realize what a gem Dr Vederas was. His lecture notes are clear and he actually TEACHES the class. Sure he may teach a little bit of Chem 263 material but his teaching makes up for it. Honestly I didn't even pass the final but ended up with an A-. Just do well on the midterm (DO ALL HIS PRACTICE TESTS) and the lab,1
Good lecturer. Lots of material. Very helpful if you ask for it.,1
"Honestly, this class is very Biased. For one, she comes right out and tells you she's a feminist... She also imposes her beliefs on you in the most annoying manner. She's OBSESSED with women's issues and the concept of Millenialism. It's ridiculously boring and I just hate attending. Her tests are ridiclous also. Pass this class up if you can.",0
"Took his class online, very confusing to say the least. Syllabus timeline is unclear, quiz directions are unclear. Midterm is timed, most of the students didn't get a chance to complete the MC part. I want to say that this class would be an easy A if his instructions were clear and if the midterm wasn't timed.",0
he is a fantastic teacher and a wonderful person. very helpful and open to students' ideas/thoughts.,1
"Kildea is one of the coolest dudes you will ever come across! He is absolutely hilarious, intelligent and driven. I really enjoyed his class and his feedback really makes you stronger. His hard work also paid off because he is now the chairman of the communication department and he is a great guy to know in terms of jobs. Stay in touch with him!",1
"ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. Do not take classes with this man. He will threaten your grade and actively try to fail you. He has no concern for how people do in the class. As he stated before last semester 50% of this class failed. He will not help you when you need it, and will belittle you when you ask for it! AVOID THIS MAN AT ALL COSTS!!!!!",0
Heidi Sarver was inspirational and great until SHE WROTE ME OUT OF THE SHOW MY SENIOR YEAR after I was a drill/marching instructor and leading member of the band for her for 3 years. I NEVER got the proper send off and must live with this for the rest of my life. Thanks for nothing Heidi.,0
"Dr. Banks has a passion for nursing and it shows through lecture. Sometimes she can be a little dry, but her caring attitude and pun jokes make up for that. She has an amazing heart and wants her students to succeed. Provides interesting guest lectures.",1
"Great guy who cares about students, but I dunno if he's really figured out how run a gaming course yet.  I'm sure once the class has been around a little while longer it'll make more sense.  I found it doubtful that he could beat up a bear, however, so that goes against him.",1
"Absolutely terrible. Rushes through lectures in a pathetically ineffective manner to minimize her workload, then gives you a 2+ hour in-class lab filled with questions that aren't covered anywhere, then you are tested on these unavailing labs with exams that are designed for you to fail. Rude, condescending, bitter. Sad state of affairs for W&M.",0
"Mrs. Lusk-Stern honestly made Psychology not all that exciting to me. It wasn't that she was a bad teacher and she is very nice and understanding, but her lectures feel useless and like they go on forever. Most of the lectures she gave only barely touched on the actual test, however she gives you very useful reviews so definitely USE them.",0
Terrible professor. tests do not make sense compared to lecture.,0
"Exams are tough if you aren't prepared. All you are expected is to write as much as you know about a piece of art that's shown in a slideshow in exams. Lectures are long. She's really savvy in what she teaches, but could be confusing sometimes. No home works so that's a good thing. Being in the class and trying to focus on lectures is important.",1
Great guy Pretty good professor. Lectures are pretty boring and hard to follow but nothing too demanding. Very boring subject to teach and he makes the best of it. No exams just a few papers topped off with a big one in the end. If youre looking  for a laid back class take lib with him.,1
Doc is WAY into music and it rubs off on his students.  Fun outside of class (KKY) and an awesome person all the way around.,1
Very nice lady and is passionate about writing! Easy to approach and very helpful. Best part about her class is that she allows revisions of drafts over and over till you're satisfy.,1
"useless, u learn nothing, knows nothing....,partial.....",0
"Tammy is tough but fair, even goes a little into front end development, which will help prepare me more for a corporate environment.",1
"LOVE HIM! Is passionate about the material, and the weekly quizzes were a great way to boost marks. His lectures are easy to understand and he is very accessible if you have questions and concerns. I would recommend this class to anyone even if you are just taking it to fulfil a core.",1
"He doesn't teach you anything. He gives you work to do and tells you to read the course material from the course website on your own time in order to get the concepts. Basically, you have to self-learn throughout the course and keep up to date with the material or you will get lost quick and won't pass this class.",0
"cogan is brillant. Professor and author he is current and funny. You will have to do the work, but he is always available for help and you will be rewarded. Fair grader.",1
I would have rated this higher but the instructor pushes political beleafes on you. That said he is an alright teacher but only has experince in civil engineering and not in Mechanical engineering so his examples are onesided.,0
"TAKE HIM. He's super funny and really makes you think about how we handle corrections in america. All quiz points are extra credit so read the chapter before class to get max points! Tests are open note, 1 group presentation, 2 papers about any topic in CJ you want. grades HARD on APA format so beware of that. He makes it hard to NOT pass his class",1
"Lecture is extremely hard to follow, you have to try very hard not to get lost. She rarely talks about pertinent things and says somewhat offensive things at times.  Sections are helpful to understanding of lecture. Candace is also very sweet, she just has no filter- could use an on-stage editor. ",0
"What a wonderful professor--the best at Cal! I am so glad I took his class. It's interesting, informative, and actually fun. The course reader is a must-have, and the textbook isn't as needed. If you take this class in the fall, make sure to go on Halloween! He dressed up as a black hole and gave out chocolate. One of my best memories in class!",1
Prof Regan is the definition of teaches by the book. Homework and classwork assignments are direct readings from the book. He speaks very clear which makes him easy to understand. He also calls on random people during review to get see who does and doesn't understand the work. Test are not overly difficult but require practice(HW and CW) to pass.,1
"You better do exactly what he wants on your assignments. Even if you get the right answer on a question, you had better write out every little detail on how you obtained your answer, no matter how unnecessary. If you don't, prepare to be criticized when he checks your homework. ",0
Makes lecture interesting and fun. Easy to get along with. Tests aren't super easy and you cant look up every question because of the time limit.,1
You will not receive  specific or constructive feedback on assignments. She will not provide feedback in the rough draft or the final draft.  She is one of the worst online teachers  I have ever had.,1
"Prof Wang just reads off his slides for the lectures and is extremely boring. His lectures are so mechanical that if he stops the lecture with a word, next class he'll resume literally from that word and keep going emotionless. His accent is very hard to understand and because of all above, just a few people, from a full auditory, go to class.",0
"one of the worst prof ever.  Especially his attitude towards students who need help, he just ignore the emails and don't reply phone calls.  Students who can't keep up, he looks down at them.  I totally hate him",0
"There is no hope, the tough grades will screw you over and the prof does not care about it at all",0
I took a class that was a boring subject but he somehow made it interesting. Super funny and laid back.,1
"Just read all the other reviews! She is an amazing teacher that make sure her students know what she is covering. She is always willing to help when you ask a question. If you are good at math and dont need a lot of extra practice, dont waste your money on the book. Full notebook page cheat sheet for every test. Can use all notes on Final Exam.",1
"Gina's english class was awesome. She chooses units that are really interesting and the readings are as well. Some get annoyed with her snarkiness, but I think it's funny. We only had two papers and a group presentation, which is not a lot for an english class.",1
"Easy class. She is super sweet and caring. Took her online & she was always accessible. Only 3 assignments & 2 tests all semester. DO THE ASSIGNMENTS. They are a bit intimidating af first, but once you start it's a piece of cake. I made A's on all assignments and failed both tests and still passed. She gives a couple of chances for e.c. as well.",1
"Dr. Lin is a terrible professor, to say the least. He makes his own quiz questions that are 100x harder than textbook questions, to be honest, there is no real point in getting textbook answers correct when the quiz and midterm questions are so hard that he probably couldn't answer them. His lectures are even worse, any other prof is better.",0
best teacher at clemson.  wears chucks on fridays and is a total badass,1
"He REALLY cares about his students and will go to great lengths to make sure everyone is succeeding. Super funny/comical and honest/genuine. Writing is horrible, and he didn't always explain what seemed obvious to him but was confusing to the class, so make sure to ask lots of qs. Key is to just do a lot of practice. Overall, great prof!",1
Decent professor. I do not like anthropology therefore the teacher needs to be very enthusiastic about the subject. She was enthusiastic but not as much as I would have hoped especially being a biology major. There is also a lot to read in class. Tests aren't too hard however.,1
"Very good teaching,I decide to take his MTH 208 too. Helpful and know how to teach MTH. You will study a lot if your attendence is ...",1
"Office hours are pretty much mandatory because the class is super disorganized. There are no powerpoints or anything so the lectures tend to go off on tangents. (He really just calls on students though so it isn't even really lecturing). Anyway, your notes will be a disorganized mess and you will get a practice exam with no answers to study from.",0
"If you're looking to learn something about Sociology,  do not take Tricarico. He gets off topic constantly, and doesn't teach a thing about the course. Good luck reading his handwriting, he may as well not write any comments on the papers. He basically rambles on for 3 hours about things that do not relate to the class. Very boring class!",0
Worst teacher ever. Doesnt teach well at all,0
Name is Irma BEVERLY now. Useless as a human being. No instructions for much of the work. The Powerpoints are from the textbook author and appear to be intended for discussion on the topics. She has explained nothing & when I asked her for more examples of statements I got a smart ass reply. Agree w/others-most answers cannot be found in the book,0
"Worst professor I have ever had by far, had to scale the final for the whole class 26 points. His lectures were more about his opinion about economics then him actually teaching about the topic. Going to class was pointless, and his tests were extremely difficult. I would not recommend taking this course or any course with him.",0
Attendance was not mandatory. Gives out a lot of extra credit opportunities. Quizzes and Exams were very easy if you were prepared.,1
"Professor who talks to students with respect. Dr. Brown is laid back and has a great attitude. Isn't afraid to crack jokes, but doesn't deviate from the material. I would recommend this Professor to anyone. It made me happy to come to class and engage. Doesn't go out of his way to make the material difficult, but makes it informing.",1
"avoid at all costs. char is a nice person but she is never available outside of class, NEVER emails you back(if she does its a one word response, 3 days later), and doesn't really know what she's doing it seems. when you ask for help she acts like youre dumb for even asking and she is not very clear on directions or homework criteria. AVOID AVOID!!",0
Professor Eager was one of the toughest instructors I have ever had. The final project was very confusing. The way he teaches was difficult to understand. He's a great person but not a very good instructor.,0
"great teacher, very hot!",1
if you actually want to learn and be challenged in your thinking you will never be disappointed.  Bonzo is by far one of the greatest profs i've ever had.  he is amazingly insightful and loves out what he teaches with his students.,1
"Dr. Silver is a great man. However, his classes aren't fantastic. He's not easy to get ahold of and grades based on a few things (pretty much all due at the end of the semester). He's prone to get way behind on the syllabus and make you buy books you won't even use. He wants his classes to be discussion-based but in reality they're lectures.",0
"Not the best, not the worst. Some of the assignments were interesting, but there was a huge amount of reading per week. Weekly written assignments and readings in addition to midterm and final projects. She randomly grades very harshly and then flips and is an easy grader. If you argue for your grade she dismisses you.",1
"Mr. Wisla is a very educated man and knows what he is talking about but he should stick to working and not teaching students. His classes are dreadful and awkward, he does not teach enough in the time span of the class, he just says one thing and calls on half of the class to provide their opinion. It is not a class anyone looks forward to.",0
I'm in her class now and I must say she is passionate and helpful. I absolutely love her. She's easy to talk... Except homework and a lot of writing but if you apply yourself and seek help she's totally there for you. I would recommend her in a heart beat.   Might I had she's beautiful! ,1
"Prof Pellerin Ã©tait une bonne enseignante pour l'intro aux relations internationales. Les sÃ©ances en classe Ã©taient intÃ©ressantes, les travaux Ã©taient pertinents aux sujets Ã©tudiÃ©s, et elle nous a poussÃ© Ã  comprendre la mÃ©thodologie des travaux universitaires, qui a bcp aidÃ©. En plus, les lectures ne sont pas obligatoires si tu es prÃ©sent en cours",1
Had Prof Younger for Child Development and it was my favourite class. He is so kind and really funny!,1
This is the worst class I have taken in my freshman year. He does not differentiate between useful and useless information.,0
"Dr. Gaitros is my favorite professor I've taken so far at FSU. I was really nervous about taking Computer Org 1, since I really struggled with COP3330 (Object Oriented Programming. This class was really easy, and actually very interesting. Definitly my favorite class I've taken. Plenty of examples in class to prepare for the exam. Don't skp class!!",1
Great math teacher!!!! Never understood it from any other teacher.. She is very clear.,1
"I don't understand how this instructor got good ratings on here. She is by far, the most least qualified and horrible professor I have ever had. I don't think she would even be qualified to work at a McDonalds. This professor not only did not know how to grade correctly, she would miss class all the time, and you never had an idea of whatwasgoingon",0
"Repeat what he says without thinking about it, and try not to fall asleep at your desk. The smile was quite creepy.",0
true beauty. ily body jones,1
"She is definitely worth taking. Very interested in her subject material and cares about her students. Grades fair with a few essays. Mainly, stay on top of the reading (they're interesting so it's not very hard just a lot to read).",1
"very supportive, clear explanations when requested, probing questions, good organization, pleasure to work with",1
"Dom was AWESOME!!!  He was very Helpful, Understanding, respectful and Fun. Easily my favorite Instructor/courses.",1
"Ms. Clausen was a really good teacher.  She knew the stuff very well, she's not intimidating and very approachable which is great for first year classes.  Class was good but got better when she started using power points, she really listens and cares.  Take her.",1
Don't take her class,0
"He goes over his notes very fast and most of the time you can't read what they say, but he explains every thing that is on the board and is a pretty good teacher.",1
"Easily the best professor at this university, you will want to come to lectures because he makes them interesting. Most importantly he wants all of his students to ace his class and is willing to take all the time needed to make sure everyone understands the concepts taught in class. Best of all is that he lets you know why what is taught matters.",1
I thought econ101 would be an easy GPA booster. I was very wrong in this case. I really would advise going with a different professor if at all possible. Lectures have nothing to due with quizzes or tests. :(,0
"Pretty bad professor in my opinion. Lectures are so boring, he just writes out problems on the board and DOESN'T EXPLAIN ANYTHING, he just uses the phrase ""so, didn't I just..."" all the time like we already know. He mumbles to himself all through class, always messes up calculations and we have to correct him. Tests are easy, homework every class.",0
"I took this class for non-major. Have to say it's not a hard class, missing so many lectures then I pass. The grade depends on 3 exam and online HW. Before exam she will provide review sheet which is helpful. Just keep in mind that do understand and memorize the review sheet, you will be fine on exam.",1
"Professor Deslauriers is absolutely one of the best professors at McGill. She is a fantastic lecturer, and I genuinely looked forward to going to class because her lectures were so fascinating and engaging. This is one of those classes that you will think about for the rest of your life- I cannot recommend it enough. Everyone should take this class",1
Fantastic Professor.,1
"Shes not a bad professor, however sometimes she does not really answer questions and is not clear at all.  The whole semester is sitting watching classmates present their lesson.  Two big papers to do that are tedious but otherwise it is easy just boring",0
Awesome Teacher,1
"Dr. Park is my favorite professor I've taken at TCU. His teaching style is very clear, and is always so helpful at his office hours! (Highly recommend going). If you do a lot of practice problems from the homework before the exams, you will do very well. He gives pop quizzes so study every day! (which will help come exam time!) Hilarious, too.",1
She goes out of her way to degrade those who don't perform up to her standards and acts like people want to do bad on assignments. The assignment/exams are not like what we did in class even when she claims they are. Hands down worst professor I have ever had.,0
"Lauries class is very easy. You should definitely show up as the online quizzes are very very easy if you have notes. Questions are taken directly from what she says in class. No homework, just 4 (easy) essays and 5 (25 Qs) quizzes thats are all online. And no final!",1
Went to his class 9 times had a B+.,1
"took his class was ruining a student. Tmr is exam , so I have no idea about my grade. but don't take his class. he is the worst . choose the second last even better than George.",0
Full of himself! Probably his own testimonials,0
Very Good teacher and you should take him.,1
"Just took an online course called ""Internal Controls.""  A few weeks into the course, he told us the wrong book was listed on the syllabus.  I have never had this happen in any class at any level of education.  This class is supposed to teach you how to lessen the chances of events like this from happening!  Not good, not good at all.",0
"He's a great source of entertainment and has done a lot for the orchestra.  However, his complacency with only the section leaders being able to play the music is extremely frustrating.  It's a huge waste of time when you just have to wait for everyone to catch up.  He won't get on people's cases for not practicing, which he needs to do.",0
"Are you familiar with Dolores Umbridge from Harry Potter? Ms. Duncan will go out of her way to embarrass her students and she DOES pick her favorites. I took this class with my little brother, week two we were already on our tip toes. She is a super tough grader, managed a B purely due to study groups. More than 3 minutes late? Stay home. Mean rude",0
"DRAGS DRAGS DRAGS the class! If you have people in your class that come to class to just listen or to sit there and be present, you'll get no where. She'll wait for them to participate and look away from those who constantly raise their hand. Sgro will wait on to the very last minute of class to dismiss. ",0
"Despite a potentially easier online class, Gateman was not engaged with students at all. His responses to emails were dry and never actually answered questions. An actual response was ""Great question ask your TA"". He also did not make it clear what we were going to be tested on and hid our midterm questions so that we could only see grades.",0
"She is a great teacher. She always emailed me back in a very timely manner. This class has really helped me with my public speaking. I loved that she allowed the class to give feedback on presentations because the feedback made me more consciousness of how other's view me. Therefore, I can correct my mistakes and improve.",1
"There are 5 discussion questions and 10 journals  at least 500 words, 10 quizzes throughout the semester and final project is powerpoint presentation with narrative . You have to keep up with moodle because something is due every week. Discussion questions are quite difficult. If you try hard and get your assignments done on time this is an easy A.",0
A relax class. Groups projects r fun. She is willing to email you back with answers until you understand. Reading assignmentshomework is to help you learn about women in global economy.  Essay paper due at the end of quarter is quite fun to write if you like your topic.  class was quite fun depending on the people. No textbook required.,1
Worst professor I have ever had at NOrthwest. Not helpful at all. I think she takes pleasure in seeing people fail. She is extremely rude. Don't take her ever.,0
Students teach each other and he facilitates. Very knowledgeable and involved. Does everything possible to involve students. Be prepared to talk / present in front of the class. I would recommend this class to others.,1
"she doesn't explain anything, she doesn't answer any questions, it almost seems like she's just there to put in some hours. I learn more through my classmates, than I do her. she is literally the worst teacher I have ever had! save yourselves the trouble and get a different teacher.",0
Very rude and sarcastic ... IF YOU HAVE DREAMS PLEASE DONT TAKE THIS PROF. She will make you feel stupid and that you are unintelligent. She is literally the worse and wont help anyone. She does not deserve to be a professor if she keeps acting like this. She is extremely careless and doesnt teach nothing ... do your self a favor and skip her nam,0
"Maojoudi is a really funny teacher, he has a sense of humor. His tests on the other hand, are SUPER EASY. His tests are basically the study guide so just review that, he also lets you have a cheat sheet. Homework and quizzes are a little heavy in this class. I depended on tutoring to help me pass this class. Basically a self teach class. GOOD LUCK.",1
He is disorganized in his approach to teaching and focuses heavy on racial aspects but not in an intellectual/safe way. He specifically talks about racism and white supremacy as it pertains to black people as a way to gain shock value but undermines the experiences/opinions of black students. If you're black don't take his course.,0
"Dr. Erickson is great! I took this class with a ton of people who disagree, but honestly, if you show up and do the work, youll do fine. His tests are difficult because they require you to fully think through the topic, but if you know your stuff, youll do fine. Hes also more than willing to help and easy to talk to.",1
"Trier only teaches through power points which are mainly just bulks of information not organized very well. All of his exams are based on examples that he doesn't always make you aware of. Overall I would say if you take him concentrate on the examples more than the actual content, but his exams are not straight forward at all.",0
"WONDERFUL PROFESSOR.  VERY CLEAR. MAKES YOU THINK AND WRITE LUCIDLY.  TAKE HIM.  IF YOU WORK WITH HIM, YOU CAN GET AN A",1
He is one of the best prof. I had. Taught the DSP course really well.,1
"Professor Raymer's class is the most unpleasant class I've taken at UNCC. He often manages to confuse himself during lectures (truly an astounding feat) and struggles to get back on track. If you have to take this class, you will need to work with other students or find a tutor. I will avoid Professor Raymer in the future.",0
"Nice guy, but not the greatest teacher. A third of his final exam was based on the last chapter of the book, which was only covered in a makeup class where only a few people went due to last minute scheduling and was never in any tutorials or assignment. He's better than other people teaching this course and better than some Concordia profs",0
"Perhaps the best CS teacher.  Lectures are relevant, he doesn't waste time and is not boring.  He's very helpful in office hours.  Grades fairly.  You have to do the work.",1
"Beth has been my favorite professor ever. I literally love her. She genuinely loves her job and will do anything to help you succeed in school. I took her as an 8am and didn't have any regrets in the morning time because I knew Beth was going to be the highlight of my day. If I have the opportunity to take her again, I 100% will.",1
Doesn't know much about film editing,0
"This teacher is one of a kind, one you'll never forget. She's funny, knows her stuff, and makes you feel comfortable throughout the whole semester. There's a group project by the end of the semester which is a bummer for those who hate presentation, however she's an easy grader on that so no worries there. She gives study guides online which helps.",1
"Comes off as stereotypical New Yorker, loud, arrogant, and full of himself. This class is pretty much full of applied psychology pseudoscience and the main objective is to make you into a snake oil salesman. The exams are useless as you can simply google the answers. The grading on other assignments is very subjective, simply bow down to score high",0
"Never gave a feedback, never clarify the assignment, never explain the assignment, reads way too much in class, the topic are outdated.",0
"Extremely disappointing. He often showed up to class without having looked at the assigned section in ""about a year"". Told us that we were going to ""write the end of his book"" for him. Gave no comments on anyone's 30pg essay that was 100% of the mark. Took 3 months to get any feedback. Absolutely disgraceful for a 4th-year seminar/any HUMS course.",0
"Rayor is nice for the most part, but can be kinda sharp and rude at times. the homework for this class is easy, just short summaries of the plays each time you read one. Exams are tough, she includes a lot of quotes that can be hard to differentiate between plays and characters. Easy class for the most part though, and very interesting.",1
"Don't be scared off. She is harsh in her marking but if you ask for her help, she will be more than willing. Her words might feel a little sharp but all she wants is for students to be ready for the harder parts of ASL. Even with online learning, she had clear and easy lectures to follow (not long). She listens to student feedback, don't be afraid.",1
"I have had worse professors, but I wouldn't say he's amazing. Lectures are really boring, which makes it hard to come to class. He has a very strong accent and can make the lectures harder to understand. Overall, he wants his students to do well and curves a lot and drops one quiz. He is also willing to help. TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE ONLINE QUIZZES!!",1
"I would not recommend anyone take this class online with this instructor, unless you are already fluent in Spanish. Does not teach,& does not provide feedback at all to students. DO NOT let the words ""Beginning Spanish 2"" fool you, as it is anything but beginning. All instructions are typed in Spanish. I am dropping before it ruins my 4.0 GPA.",0
AMAZING TEACHER!!!! As a transfer student Ive had a lot of exposure to many teaching styles and Prof Schore is by far the most incredible teacher Ive had thus far. Yes it is ochem so youre going to have to try! But he teaches so well and Thoroughly that the material will be enjoyable to you (he helped write the book AKA READ THE B O O K),1
"He never explains in detail, I have to borrow notes from other professors' course to study. Only allows 6 minutes for online calculation quiz, probably the worst professor in the faculty of ME.",0
"Great professor, easy if you show up for class. Highly recommended.",1
The exams are incredibly hard! Our first class exam average was a 34 and Markowski said that was good. He often skipped over my questions in class and never came back to answering them for me. It was frustrating to have to badger him for answers.,0
"She was a very caring and personal professor. She was a very easy test giver, and her assignments were to the point and precise. You need to go to class, as your attendance is taken every day, and it is 150 points! Very easy and a nice, relaxing class.",1
Wasn't expecting to love it but she's awesome.  Best prof ever.  She's funny and has great extension policy. She really wants you to do well. Easy multiple choice exams. Essays a little harder but good instructions.,1
He dont know how to teach !!! don't choose his class!!!,0
"I had AP credit for Calc 1 but decided to retake it. If you have not taken calculus before, I would not recommend doing it with Chester. Lectures are boring, and he makes a lot of mistakes on the board. Expect to learn everything in discussion. Luckily, the examples in the book and discussion worksheets are nearly identical to the tests.",0
He makes you feel very dumb no matter your question or concern. His test are about 15% of what he goes over in class. Talks about everything that isn't on the tests. He spends more time on the 'unimportant' things. He wants you to devote ur life to the class. With him its more of a self taught class and A&P is defiantly not the class for that.,0
"I've always gotten good grades throughout college, but Professor Baker destroyed my GPA with that class. Studied my butt off to have my highest test score be an 80%. All tests based off his notes, has HORRIBLE handwriting, and the whole class is based off exams.",0
"I really enjoyed the class. It is true that you have to read the book. Her lectures are helpful, but not always on topic. If you ever need help outside of the classroom with anything though, she is wonderful for that.  She is fair. You just have to go to class, participate, and do the homework.",1
"She is not very helpful over discussion forms where you should be encouraged to ask questions, but instead she gives rather rude responses. Also, our class went into the final exam blind, we didn't even know how many questions would be on the exam. Also, please read the textbook, it really helps!",0
"Many people give this teacher good reviews only because of her positive attitude and cool humor which i can agree on, but do not let her positive attitude fool you she is really tough when it comes to grading her tests are up to 50% and everything else is below 10. So trying to bring the grade up was extremely hard!!! Would not take again",0
I was afraid to take this class after reading her rates on here i considered dropping and finding a new prof. I ended up staying in her class and actually enjoyed it! I skimmed the readings before class or even during lectures and made sure to speak up EVERY DAY! Tests are not that hard as long as you remember what you talked about in discussion!,1
"He has a tendancy to get off the topic sometimes, but more often than not, his lectures were interesting.  Translation quizzes were easy and papers weren't too long.",1
"I love Dr. Federico! I took her for an upper level English class and I just wish I had met her sooner. She's so genuinely sweet. A tough grader, but I sincerely loved going to her class. Participate and let yourself enjoy it. She's great",1
"He brings out his material the way you want to give up his course. learning curve was not steep, it was out of dimension. I would definitely benefit more from his class if I was given more resources and practice questions with solutions that are appropriate. I like him as a person, but I don't believe he knows what students need.",0
Monica really cares about her students success. Course content was difficult but she has a way of making the class fun and lecture easier to understand. Take her if you get the chance,1
Sherry is horrible. She gives you zero information and wants her class to do bad. She gives a ridiculous amount of questions for an hour exam and then gets mad at the class for doing bad. She is very non understanding and seems to not care about how bad they are doing. I hope one day she realizes we are doing bad due to her unrealistic expectations,0
"I do NOT recommend her at all. I never enjoy or look forward to her classes, her tests are so long and difficult that most of my class never finishes (I don't think I've finished once and she gives us TWO classes to do them), and she's just plain rude. I learn more from the math labs she assigns than 50 minutes 3 times a week with her.",0
"Not as great as everyone below says , grading criteria is clear but if any assignment is missed or is not good according to her rubric she wont let you fix it or make it up . Makes you do all the work on blackboard but is never on blackboard herself . Writing intensive course so youll have to write 5-6 journals and two major papers .",0
She needs to care more about students.,0
"This class was awful. I dreaded it everyday. Oglivie is nice, however he is extremely boring. Only two papers and a final exam. Makes this intro class way harder. He thinks everyone was a history major.",0
Professor McDaniel does not make this class interesting nor teaches enough on the material needed for the test.,0
"really good teacher, challenging assignments, you learn a lot, and he's so knowledgeable.",1
"Hated this man, he ruined every MWF for me.",0
"This was Dori's first semester teaching 310, and we had lots of issues with our exams. Exams alone make up 60% of your grade. You really have to put in effort and time if you want to pass this class. She was confusing most of the time, and I felt I could've done better in this class with a different prof. She's nice, but this class is difficult.",0
VERY rude to her students. if a prof wants respect and quiet from students they have to respect students AND be at least somewhat interesting. Dr. O does neither. She would interupt her class to point out someone leaving... in a 400 person class there are Bound to be ppl who leave. deal with it,0
"John Cole is by far the best professor I've ever had. MKTG 4343 is a challenging class but if you are interested in Sales, TAKE IT. He has taught me so much and truly cares about each individual student. If you get the chance to participate in the Walton Sales Competition, DO IT. It was a great experience and a huge extra credit opportunity.",1
"I heard this was an easy class, but it's literally one of the hardest classes I've taken in college. Dr. Boss is really nice and knowledgeable, but he has really clear biases, his lectures are not organized, and his tests are so random and unpredictable. I make good grades, but I made a C. I would not take from him ever again.",0
"Dr. Beckman is a very knowledgeable and intelligent professor, his classes are very interesting and usually not too difficult if you pay attention in class. You will probably do a few projects in his class, but he doesn't give too much homework and is a very fair grader.",1
"Shapiro may be easy -- but this is because she develops such a strong personal bond with each student that you feel guilty if you don't truly apply yourself.  She is smart, makes students excited about class and aware of the issues, and assigns work that you actually learn from",1
Professor Bamford is British not Australian. The readings are complex but I enjoyed them. The course touches on topics such as race and gender and is relevant to us now. Based off of that and her willingness to help students I am glad I took this course.,1
"Came to every class, took notes, & studied, but the exams were horrible. To be honest choose any other professor. He cannot teach the subject well, his TA teaches better than him. Its not worth your time, worst professor at mason.",0
"extremely hard tests. Nice teacher, loves teaching math. grades hard on homework. Again, very hard tests.",1
"He's a really nice guy, but a terrible professor in every way possible. His lectures are extremely boring/not beneficial, he takes FOREVER to grade assignments, he is terrible at communicating with students outside of class, he is super disorganized and an unreasonably harsh grader. Trust me, if you're not a WFB major, DO NOT take his class.",0
"Absolute worst professor at the university. Do not take him unless you can teach an entire course to yourself, otherwise, you won't pass. Over half of my class dropped. Will literally call you dumb to your face if you ask for help. AVOID",0
I'd take an art class if I had it to do over,0
By far the best teacher I have ever had. You get two essays all semester then some easy response papers. It's not just easy but you actually learn in his class. Definitely taking again!,1
"Very helpful, want's you to succeed.  Not the easiest tests, but should be able to pull a B with minimal studying.",1
"Get ready for boot camp, because that's what you get. Non-stop work, she seems to flaunt how many students she has turned into the Deans for plagiarism. Very strict on everything, there is no room for anything but what she wants and when she wants it, and it is a lot.",0
"RICHARD <33 made me love earthquakes so much, such a good prof, take him please!!",1
"the way they grade eecs1012 is pretty dumb so i guess i can sympathize with a lot of the others who didn't like it. you have to complete these flowcharts within 10-20 mins of the programs they want, kind of like pseudo-code charts or logic charts. if you have any coding exp you should be able to do well, didnt know html or go to class and got an A+",1
"This class is a difficult class if you have a shaky math background regardless of the professor. That being said, Dr. Schommer does not make that issue any simpler to resolve. He speaks fast and his handwriting in nearly illegible. He is an extremely nice person, and he definitely knows what he is talking about.",1
He is so amazing. My favorite teacher by far at Belmont!!!! (It's hilarious when he starts rapping Eminem lyrics).,1
"This guy is the best professor; he is one heck of a perfomer in his lectures. He has the feeling of being ""laid back"", but the class is not. You have to keep up on your work and make sure you are prepared for the exams, they are all in essay form. This was one of my favorite classes and it was due to Mr. Wise's personality and teaching.",1
Best class on campus -everyone must take social psychology with Julka -life-altering.,1
He's really chill. All his classes are fun and everyone learns in his class.,1
Good class. Required for my major. He gives really clear lectures and is pretty funny and personable which is nice. Tests are easy but he makes up for that with papers and writing assignments even though these are also fairly easy. Still a really interesting class and he is a very laid back knowledgable teacher. Lots of connections to COJO world. ,1
"Devey doesn't seem to be able to apply the educational principals he is teaching. Though i was well prepared, i barely survived the first exam- got an A, but scrambled to understand the questions. When I tried to contact the prof he ignored my emails and discussion board posts, and doesn't hold office hours. This class was a major bummer.",0
Doesnt provide help and your whole grade is based upon your test and quiz scores which she doesnt provide much help with. IF YOU HAVE TO TAKE THIS CLASS CHOOSE ANOTHER TEACHER. One person in my class got an A 8 people had Bs and the rest failed. More than 60% of the class got D's or F's. Bad teaching. she ruined my college career,0
"Look by no means am I a bad student. Throughout my whole time here at GVSU this is the WORST professor I have ever had. She doesn't assist students, gives terrible outlines, has tests that are all too long and too hard. All around just awful! IF YOU CAN AVOID THIS PROFESSOR, DO IT WHEN YOU CAN AND SAVE YOURSELF! YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!",0
"Valuable course. Imparts much knowledge and wisdom about linux system administration. You would not come close to replicating the value of this course through online tutorials, so it's well worth tuition. Every class is a follow-along lecture; there is no structure to homework other than working on your own to make sure you understand things.",1
"Stott is kind and tries his best, but the class is super disorganized. Each week is 1 lecture/1 reading discussion. he grades easily and tells you exactly what will be on tests so you can very easily prepare. He has you read a lot but you can get away with skipping most readings if you're good at Bs-ing a comment or 2 during each discussion.",1
"BEST TEACHER EVER. Super frinedly, upbeat, and always has a smile on his face. always willing to help,great positive personality. TONS of extra credit, can't leave this class without an A or B.",1
All around great man,1
Zein is probably the worst grader I have heard of. She shoots down questions in class and often rushes through classes in order to finish her lecture. Avoid getting her at all cost.,0
"I've been taking English 102 with Professor Robertson and have found the course load in this class to be ridiculous. For being a general education requirement, the work is hard, tedious, and unnecessary. The deadlines change often, and not enough time is given to complete projects. I do not recommend taking any class from this professor.",0
I took every class he teaches except one...I love history and geography...if you don't try to love it you won't love the classes and you will probably just think that he is boring but he isn't..,1
jumps around alot with out explaning things,0
"For the people that say they don't like her, I honestly don't understand why. She's probably one of the most memorable profs I've had at Mac so far. Yes, she's a tough marker and the course is super content-heavy, but if you're prepared to put in the work, it's a breeze. I went to her office hours many times throughout the semester, and it helped!",1
"knew a lot about the information in lectures, but gave way too much busy work. read the book and go to all lectures since he takes attendance randomly. take advantage of extra credit and go to all study sessions to get an A. ",0
"A good professor that was clear in his lectures that were sometimes boring, sometimes interesting. Have to come to class, because lectures have clicker questions and are major part of your grade. No homework, except like 5 learning modules that can be done in 10 minutes. 3 Exams that are like the non-graded online quizzes he posts. ",1
We started this class Face to Face. Attendance was mandatory. There is a quiz at the beginning of every class. 4 exams and 1 Final. If you follow his lectures and do the work you will succeed. There were a lot of negative comments about him here but I really enjoyed his class. I respect his style of teaching. I highly recommend him!,1
"Professor Brad was a good teacher, he ensured you knew the material and made certain that you wouldn't move forward until you knew what you were doing.  He may come down a little hard when asking questions, but not in a bad way he questions you and makes you think.",1
He is the most fun prof i have had in college. He makes the class super easy and surprisingly fun. You could not fail his class if you tried. Super funny make sure you take his class.,1
Pretty good teacher. I butt heads with him based on my lack of attendance. Putting that aside hes a great laid back teacher! Highly recommend.,1
"Hellquist is an awesome guy. He is so enthusiastic and loves what he does which makes his lectures so interesting! His tests are really hard and he grades really hard. Take notes and pay attention in class, he will give you his powerpoints but they have barely any text in them so it is required that you pay attention to do decent on the exams.",1
"Maybe the most boring professor I've ever had. The sample exams aren't too similar to the real exams. If you can manage to pay attention, you will learn a lot about OS",1
I had him for bio 120. The tests were hard and his powerpoints are straight from the book. He skips over multiple slides and hes hard to follow along with. I got a B- and wanted a better grade for a 4 credit class so Im taking it this year and I have an A. Avoid him for bio,0
"He sometimes can be rude, shouting ""shut up"" in class. I know the class is somewhat noisy, but it's not a good way, OK? Even though he was shouting ao other people, not me, I feel very uncomfortable. He talks about things kind of fast and not in a clear way and you need to guess what he tries to say, especially close to the end of the course.",0
this is an exellent course.,1
one of the worst i had at marist- felt like i was in a capping course witht he way he graded- did not explain well at all and tests were impossible- def avoid if possible,0
Just don't take her class. VERY opinionated and shows sarcasm and disrespect towards students. Talks politics more than teaches.,0
very bad . dont take the course with him even if he was the only prof there.,0
this is an online class with homework every week and graded on WebAssign. Homework is worth 60% of the grade. one Midterm and final worth 40% of your grade. The homework gives you 6 tries to get it right. So do your homework you are almost guaranteed 60% of your grade. He answers questions quickly online.,1
"This is an ALEKS based class (so it's mostly online). He goes an objective each class. Flies through problems, doesn't teach, just expects you to understand. Gets mad when you don't talk to him. He doesn't put in grades but is nice because he lets you retake tests.",0
Perhaps the worst professor at Queen's.  She is boring in class and nasty in person.  She is not sympathetic whatsoever to students and their needs. Horrible.,0
"Do not take this class with this professor. He is arrogant, unhelpful, and spends the entire class talking about himself. I fell asleep every day that I went to class. Class attendance is not necessary, but tests were very hard. Only saving grace is that the textbook had outlines online. So don't bother reading the actual book.",0
"This is by far the most confusing and frustrating class I've taken in the past 20 years. Even if you actively listen and participate in her Collaborate sessions, you still won't understand what she wants. Don't bother emailing her. She is very rude to students via email. As a teacher, she makes learning frustrating and doesn't answer questions.",0
"Not to fault Prof Dynes, but this class was painful to get thru. Very long lectures covering boring material. Very hard to make it thru a full lecture while actually paying attention. GO TO THE TA EXAM Q&A SESSIONS. If you go to those and take good notes, you should pass no problem. Open notes, open internet tests which was also helpful.",0
"Terrible. Does not reply to emails, phone calls and is never in the office, if she is busy she should not over schedule herself at the expense of tuition paying student, who are also busy and working. Class is not educational, you will learn nothing.",0
"Do not take this class. There are only three tests, and then a final. You are allowed to use a note card on the final, but it won't help. He makes you feel like an idiot if you ask a question. I hate going to this class.",0
Julie is wonderful! very helpful!,1
"You'd be lying to yourself if you said you actually remembered majority of this stuff this guy taught you. Oh wait, we only see him through pre-recorded lectures. Prime example of a lazy online professor!",0
She's a *insert profanity here*. You'll have a speech on second day of class and you won't get told how it's supposed to go. Good luck,0
Never take her class. She is tough and not a great teacher. I mostly taught myself. The test is heavy.,0
"Class is not too difficult. There will be 5chapters per test and 11 questions so you have no clue what to focus on. She will NOT round like every teacher which is ridiculous,if you get an 89.9999% she refuses to give the A- even if you never missed a class. The projects take a lot of time $ count for little. One bad test and your grade is ruined.",0
"jUST when you think you have gotten a grip of the class structure She changes the syllabus and expects you to know whats coming next without informing you. WORST Prof EVER. She's not even a prof. She rushes through the material, assigns never ending readings & homework's, gives pop up quizzes, 3 presentations, in class debate, online hw, finals :((",0
Good teacher.  Makes the class fun.  Uses powerpoints.  Always helpful and understanding.  Gives extra credit for homework assignments and quizzes.  Tests are multiple choice.,1
"Really hard to understand during the first few lectures, but then you get used to his style of teaching. If you just follow his teaching, you can do well in Math 243. Do not take web assign for granted, and if there's any problem, ask him directly. If you skip a lecture, you will miss a lot of things.",1
"Doesn't use blackboard or anything technological at all. DO NOT buy the connect code because you won't use it. He is very funny and tries to relate Econ to things kids care about. Has terrible handwriting but you get used to it, you just have to pay attention. Knows his stuff and wants you to understand it too. Class is graded off of a few things.",1
"Dont take any course with her. the homeworks and quizzes are so easy, but the midterms and final exam is extremely hard. half of the seats were empty after the second midterm. she said there will be a curve because of the low average, but she never did that.",0
"The goat! Took him for gen psych and again for humanistic. 3 multiple choice exams, 2 papers, and 1 discussion group activity. Memorize lecture slides and do the readings and youll do well on the exams.",1
"Hes really funny and despite teaching about politics, he rarely expresses his personal political beliefs, with the exception of hating all politicians and Wall Street (as we all should). One time, he said The only thing politicians know how to read is checks. Anyways, he simply teaches you the philosophers claims and he makes it understandable.",1
"I don't know WHAT some of these people are talking about.  First of all, if you are not willing to talk and argue with ""femanist liberals,"" then what exactly makes you want to do English? I have found that all POV's are considered with good supportive evidence.  If she seems cold, try to show her how interested u r in the class, u may be surprised!",1
One of the best I have ever had.  The only one Grad. from MIT. knows her stuff.,1
The worst professor I've ever had. Doesn't seem to care about his students or anything in general. Idk why he has the attitude that he does. Terrible experience. His exams are all from the past papers tho. Do those and you would be good. My terrible grade is on me lol but he still SUCKS,0
"Long-winded kind of guy, doesn't use much visual aid. Lectures are exactly what the word means, and I would not recommend the class.",0
"One of my favourite classes! He is very detailed in his lectures which makes the class very interesting! Would highly recommend anyone to take his class. Once you put the work in, you can be successful.",1
Tests are tough. Reads through ppt type of teacher. Has jokes along the way. Not really an easy C as some may put it.,0
"Dr. Auer is the wackiest professor I have ever had, but he really knows his stuff, teaches it well, and is ALWAYS willing to help you.  There are 4 quizzes and he drops your 2 lowest grades, and he gives extra credit if you hand projects in early.  The class is super easy and you don't really have to pay attention in class.  Take this class!",1
"Hes a nice guy but his tests are IMPOSSIBLE! it is TRUE when they say ""Either you get philosophy or you don't!"" He always wants to smoke and drink coffee, all he ever talks about.... hes extremely hard but like I said he is a nice guy. Only take him if you enjoy philosophy...",0
There were interesting topics and it related to my major. Readings are long & confusing but she explains it though you have to pay attention when she talks. She is picky about grading papers but goes over drafts if you ask her. I started doing more readings to finish groupwork as the extra points for it helps your grade.,1
"Lectures are awful, incredibly boring and monotone. Lots of reading quizzes and group discussions (both online) that he does not tell you about. These things are a large chunk of your grade. Will count you off in the group discussion if you do what you are asked, but no one else replies. I did not enjoy him, look elsewhere if you can.",0
"Worst professor I've ever had at Hofstra. Lectures are very sporadic and unorganized, and little from lectures actually appears on the test. Useless when I asked him questions after class. Taught myself everything in that textbook to finally pull off a mediocre grade. Avoid him at all costs.",0
"Roger makes French as logical as it can be, and he does so with great charm and wit. Makes you wish you had him as a Father.",1
"Dr. Graham is one of the best teachers I've had. He explains things in a clear fashion, often explaining in a "" how I would do it"" fashion. Never shoots down students ideas or questions, but explores them. Lots of pop quizzes, but you are able to opt out of them if you want. He does not assign homework either. I highly recommend that you take him.",1
"Great professor, very helpful and gives very clear assignments, with due dates always posted at the beginning of the week, so you always know when something is due. Textbook is NEEDED! Only con is he takes forever to grade papers so it takes 2-3 weeks till you get your results.... However he replies really fast to emails, and very helpful!",1
"Her lectures are useless, she is always late and constantly making excuses. She blames technology for every problem she has but then wont excuse a mistake from a student that was not their fault. Avoid her at all costs",0
"Not a terrible teacher, but not an amazing one either. She seems to know a lot about what she's talking about, but she DOES NOT appear passionate in any way. She smiles and tries to relate to students, but at the end of the day, most students in the class do not respect her. Her class isn't extremely hard, but the prompts are a bit silly...",0
"This class was both very enjoyable and enlightening, despite it being my earliest class all semester! Professor Henigman is smart, encouraging, and accessible. She goes out of her way to make sure everyone's comments are heard and validated during the discussion. The required film viewings are lots of fun too!",1
if you don't have a strong math background or foundation run away. he will embarrass and make jokes at questions he feels should know. rushes through everything writes chicken scratch on board. ask him to write harder or clearer its a joke can barely understand him. don't waste your time and money.,0
"Dr. Keeling is a very demanding teacher and does not and will not give you extra help / accommodation when you need it. He expects everything his way or you'll get a 0, while preaching ""grades don't matter."" If you miss a class or show up a fraction of a second late, he'll passive aggressively call you out on it and make you feel terrible.",0
"Angelica is the most helpful, caring, and thorough math teacher I've ever had. If you get to know her, she is awesome! Math is based off of the basic skills learned in pre algebra, and yes, Angelica assumes that you know that... Unless you speak up!!! Lowest 3 quizzes are dropped and notes can be used on them. I am following her to future courses.",1
Would give 5/5 overall rating and 3/5 for difficulty.,1
I had him last summer and found him to be a great professor. He clearly explains a lot of the concepts and gives handouts. ,1
Terrible. Heavy accent. Unorganized. ,0
She is very disorganized and doesn't not explain assignments clearly. Assignments and readings take forever to complete and she has unrealistic expectations.,0
"Professor Moton is probably the hardest professors I've had yet. He requires so much work and probably forgets that people have other classes, children and jobs. Although he does give good feedback, his grading is very harsh. I do not suggest taking his classes!",0
This man clearly hates teaching.,0
"Bob is awesome. He has a ton of experience that he puts into his classes. Acting is about trust, energy, and willingness to try new things - if you meet this criteria then you are well on your way to becomeing an actor/actress. Bob makes it easy to achieve in his class, listen, be respectful, smart and be willing to try new things.",1
"Not friendly at all, very unaproachable. Can't use the required book for reference, because when you are in her class you are in ""SHAMANE LAND,"" therefore you do things her way. After 19 classes at LCC, she is definitely at the top of my worst list.",0
"Very helpful and fair prof, but seems like 100 level classes are too easy for him. He doesn't fully engage and forgets where he left lectures off all the time. Lectures can be a waste of time, but as long as you do the homework and pay attention to what he says will be on exams you'll do well in his class. ",1
"Lots of reading, dry content, and your mark is comprised of 3 midterms worth 30, 30 and 40%. This is the worst professor I've ever had by far. Lectures move at a snail's pace, you can self-study the content in 1/3 the time. About 50% of his lectures are ""background information"" and personal stories but if you skip them you miss tiny details.",0
"I sat in the third row of the lecture hall and still found it very hard to hear what he was saying, he would talk toward the ground and he would never speak directly to the class. This class is very test heavy beware! Although the lab does help your grade a little bit, it doesn't help as much as you think.",0
"He seems to be a good guy, but he needs to slow down when he's teaching. He goes too fast and often messes up when teaching. Beware of the probability section of this class! It's very difficult. If the class scores below average he'll give EC on the exams.",0
"Yea, what the guy below said. Stay away from professor nemat. he's ignorant, and he doesn't care about students learning. Everybody literally cheated, and he doesn't even know it. Dumb old dude.",0
"The HARDEST Professor I have ever taken at JMU. Unless you want to self teach yourself everything, and have to memorize the textbook SWITCH out immediately! If you ask a question he will laugh at you at tell you it was in the textbook. He is a nice, and respected person, but way too hard of a grader and professor. GET OUT",0
Best professor I've ever had!,1
"Dr. Bob is very very smart and his lectures are often hard to follow. But, if you read the textbook, do the homework, and follow along during lectures, the class is more manageable. He is very helpful outside of class and post all the test online so you can study. I would recommend him if you like math and are ready for a challenge.",1
"Very arbitrary. Teaches useless old models that no one uses. Old, outdated symbols. He may have been amazing in his time, but he is no longer a good teacher.",0
"HATE! HATED this class, everything you give him an answer he would say you were wrong then tell you that he didn't know the real answer but you were still wrong.  if you can take someone else. At times he would make it seem like every person is bad that there is no good people in this world. And being in his class I know why teachers messed up!",0
"Pretty entertaining, gave the class the finger once by accident while trying to explain something. Tests were fair as long as you put in the effort to learn the equations and how to use them. Tutorials were basically a road map for the assignments. And he's a nice guy.",1
"Toni knows his stuff, and has no trouble conveying it in an interesting and concise manner. He adds his personal stories and experiences to make the subject matter more relatable. He is hilarious, and throws a lot of little jokes in with the lecture. This was my 2nd class with Toni, and hopefully won't be my last.",1
"skews lecture to his political opinion (conservative leaning). MUST attend lecture, he makes no power points, literally talks the entire hour. papers are complex, but do-able, if you are a skilled writer. fair grade policy.",0
"This class is ALOT of work. You have a group presentation, 3 exams open notes but they are difficult, 13 paper discussions, 10-15pg final paper. Participation matters. You only get 1 unexcused absent. You have to work hard for your grade.",0
"This was the most ridiculously fun film class I've had at GVSU.  You experiment and then do two projects, one about a theme the other just trying to break the narrative form.  Plus you get to go to Chicago if you want with this class. Nothing is to strange or weird...go for it!",1
This professor is so easy! You have a few tests and a few quizzes on map locations. They are all really easy but the tests can be confusing at times. He is really funny and makes a lot of South Park jokes.,1
"Did not like his lectures, learned on my own. ",0
"This was a blended learning class so we only had to be in class once a month to take the actual test, but she gives you chapters to read and maps to complete. The maps are on the test and so is the content of whatever she makes you read. BUT she does a great review right before each test, so pay attention, expect homework and you'll do fine! ",1
"Honestly felt uncomfortable going to class because I never knew what he was talking about.  Moves fast and teaches in an unorthodox manner which only those with knowledge coming into the class seem to moderately understand, and even then, sometimes leave more confused.  Great guy but shouldn't be teaching.",0
AWESOME TEACHER. Took her first aide class on tuesday nights and she is really awesome. You would have to seriously be special to not do really well in her course. It's common sense stuff but she makes it as interesting as possible! TAKE THIS TEACHER!,1
"Prof Tefera is a nice guy but honestly the worse professor I have ever taken. If you get the answers right on test but your work isnt EXACTLY what he wants, he will still take off most of the points. The average for our take home test was a 61%. He is so hard to understand, and really doesnt care if you do good in the class or not. Dont take him",0
Awesome professor! Really knows how to explain to everyone from different backgrounds of knowledge.,1
"One of my favorite professors at Duke and definitely the best class I have taken so far (Business in the Francophone World). Deb puts a lot of work into her lesson plans and it shows, as we're constantly learning and doing different activities that aid in us learning more about the topics we're studying. I was actually sad to have the class end.",1
SO.  BORING.  HOLY.  GOD.,0
"Usually you should not have to ask for help and should understand what the project ask from you. However, this professor cannot be bothered to explain it clearly. Terrible professor. Do not waste your time and find yourself a better professor.",0
"English is obviously not his first language, very heavy accent. He writes EVERYTHING on the board & you really need to copy all of it down word for word. He gets very confusing, especially when you ask questions. If you skip class he will dock your grade.  Do the homework, he gives pop quiz next day using the homework. Gets mad if you don't read.",0
"She is my favorite professor so far at NJIT for sure. She will go the extra mile to help you understand something if you don't get it you just need to ask. You can tell that she thoroughly knows her stuff. She does have an accent but it's nothing that isn't hard to understand. She has a tendency to always say ""yes this is what!"" its adorable lol.",1
"Very easy to follow, perfect amount of work for a winter semester.",1
"You ask a simple question in class, you get a long winded, confusing answer. The lectures were extremely disorganized, didn't even follow her own handouts. If you politely approach her with concerns or need for clarification, get ready for some passive aggression. 200+ pages read per class mainly not discussed, but they're definitely on the test.",0
"For my class he had a tendency to go over the class time by a few minutes, so that was frustrating but overall he really cares about what he's teaching and has lots of good stories",1
Does not use brightspace which is annoying. Content is incredibly boring. don't recommend,0
I was in the online section so I don't know much about the professors teaching style but he was very understanding and emailed back quickly about any questions on any assignments. I did feel like the programming projects took much longer than the expected times given but that's probably my bad.,1
The class is pretty straight-forward. Homeworks are reallyyyy easy and she drops one exam! I would just go to lectures and take good notes (ESPECIALLY examples) and definitely use the study guides that she posts.,1
"Very nice teacher who was always smiling and making jokes.  His tests covered alot of material, and it was hard sometimes to know and spell all of the vocabulary words.  He always gave us a test layout before the tests, which was helpful.",1
she is very nice,1
Very interesting class.  He's funny when he breaks into his spanish accent.,1
Okay this teacher is great! He works with you! H is very passionate about what he teaches. I enjoyed going to every class! ,1
Terrible terrible teacher,0
I took him for BCA210 as a freshman my first semester. There are 2 big group projects (which were fine) but he doesn't give you any exams over the entire semester. THE FINAL EXAM IS WORTH 45% OF YOUR FINAL GRADE! Most A's in the class will change to C's or worse because of it. Choose a different professor if possible.,0
Pretty boring professor but the slides help a lot. He curves. Didn't use the text book that much. Take CLAS and you'll be fine.,0
"awsome guy, just be ready to reread everything you turn in.  little mistakes and you get major points off",1
"Professor speaks clearly and you can actually understand him. His course notes were amazing so you didn't need to take notes in his class. Exams are fairly hard. However, the prof will not accommodating at all and you will have to live with whatever he gives you.",1
"I'm not great at math and personally it was hard to follow Dr. Burnap in class. His handwriting can be hard to read at times. Not really a fan of his teaching style and often things worked on in class do not match up with webwork assignments, quizzes, and tests. If you're good at math this may not bother you, or be prepared to learn on your own.",0
"The WORST prof I've ever had. lectures are 3 very painfully boring hours. He goes through the slides extremely fast, however he doesn't post them online. there is almost nothing that we're graded on and his midterm and exam were NOTHING similar to what was taught in class. DO NOT RECOMMEND",0
He acts like a kid in a grown ups body...just like most of the profs in the GVSU music department.,0
Really good class to take.  She makes it easy to follow along and very fair in grading.  The only problem is when she turns the lights off its a little harder to pay attention (night class),1
I really liked Professor Marks. Homework and basically everything comes from the packet he assigns. He returns grades quickly and encourages you to come talk to him about any problems you have. Excellent teacher.,1
"Jeff Allen is the man. Keeps computer class entertaining which is hard to do. So laid back and relaxed. Great teacher, highly recommend him for CIS",1
"Angell cares more than anyone about his students. His classes are difficult, but if you put in the effort you will learn. He is a real gem, and unbelievably helpful in office hours.",1
"Lectures are clear- because she repeats herself constantly - sometimes through multiple lectures. The subject matter (am. abstract expressionists) is interesting, and she seems to know a lot about it, but she get stuck on certain terms, which is boring.",1
"Trevor is an amazing professor! I think majority of the bad reviews probably come from the student who never showed up to lecture or did the readings. That being said he is definitely cheeky, but his humour is rather entertaining in my opinion. Do the work and you'll love the class (and learn a lot about writing).",1
"Very tough grading. If your solution doesn't match the answer key but you feel like you should've gotten part marks, you're SOL.   Hu is a great guy but its tough to get a good mark.",1
"I absolutely loved professor Welham! He is hilarious and a rockstar of a teacher. I didn't go to class much, but I always went to his office when in need of help, and he was so willing to help. He really wants his students to learn and take away good fundamentals and easy tricks from this course. Would love to have him for all of my math classes!",1
"nice lady, willing to help....but very unfair at grading....u MUST BE VERY SPECIFIC when taking exams",1
"Very focused on himself and his own ideas, and not enough time given at all to the texts and alternate readings of them. Friendly and entertaining, but I hated going to class--felt like a waste of time.",1
"Ugh, he's very opinionated and wants you to stay what he wants you to say. Other outlooks aren't accepted.",0
"Horribly disorganized. I remember his tangents more than I remember anything important that he tried to point out. One day, when the class didn't read a poem for class, he prissily stormed out of the class. On top of that, he was very condescending. You haven't done college until you take a hack like him. Crass and Classless Classics prof!",0
"STAY AWAY!!! I have never in my five years of math had a professor this bad. I took this class as my last calc class to transfer. After all, everyone says business calc is the easiest to pass. And it is! except with this professor he makes it nearly impossible to get 100 on anything! he gave -3 on a test ques. because my work didn't show simplified",0
He is the best teacher in history,1
this man is evidence of the sad state of the philosophy department at UVic,0
"She is very strict with her grading on the homework assignments, so even minor errors can drop your score significantly. Her lectures were all PowerPoints and she didnt really explain how to actually code a program very well. Labs often took way longer than expected, and required work outside of class.",0
Conta was an amazing professor when I attended class with him back in 2011-2013. Great to see an actual police officer become a professor and have such vast work knowledge/experience but also incorporate it into a lecture format and be able to teach students. I took pretty much all the courses he offered and left LACC with an AA in Criminal Justice,1
"Dr. Legg wasnt too bad, but I felt he didnt explain concepts very well and his quizzes and tests were hard even after reading the textbook. He also has an attitude at times",1
Very helpful and knows a great deal about the material. Must take notes and do the readings if you want to get an A!,1
"Bernstock was the worst lecturer I've ever had the displeasure of having. She was erratic, confusing, confusing, unprofessional, and boring. She managed to sour one of my absolute favorite topics of learning with her in-class outbursts. The class itself was not very enlightening and I would certainly recommend avoiding it. ",0
"Dr. Hardy has the unique quality of caring about the larger image of education. His goal is to develop your mind, not only teaching history outstandingly. He's quite a character and one of the best professors I've had. If you're afraid of being bored, you'll get enough to read in his class. Study well, and the A is possible. Hardy's grading is fair",1
"He is honestly a terrible teacher. He does not deliver the material clearly at all. He over examines problems and was teaching our class how to round in Pre-Calc. Is unorganized and he is difficult to understand through his broken English. He has good intentions, but you have to teach yourself. You do not learn anything in class. ",0
"She is a respectable scholar, but not necessarily fit for the teaching profession. She pretends very hard to have a balanced way of thinking when it comes to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict but her bias shines RIGHT THROUGH. Not the most accommodating instructor either.",0
"Def need a hard copy of the book; electronics are prohibited in class. Each class he would call on students to translate parts of the story (if you don't have the translation, then he'll let you know it's ok and go on). Quizzes are given but he'll let you know the day before. The only awful thing about this class was that it was at 7:30AM.",1
read out overheads every class..always absent..no point for setting up lectures!,0
Mr. Finelli was a very mediocre professor who let peers instead of him determine the grade a student gets. Aside from this he carried a very rude and non-caring tone when he responded to emails sent with relevant questions. The class was okay but this professor definitely does not need to be teaching.,0
she's a hard grader but shes really nice.  she knows what she's talking about so if your into politics take one of her classes.  she does stutter tho which can be annoying but shes cool.,1
"No way I can understand this guy...very HEAVY RUSSIAN accent + no good presentation slides. If you take his class, you're on your own to teach yourself.",0
"Good Class, great professor.  Made writing fun for me.  Definitely recommended.",1
"Best professor ever! Funny, nice, pretty and fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love Dr Levine.",1
Very rude. Tests are hard and she goes off topic!,0
She gives terrible instructions. Often gets her class sections mixed up and tells us different due dates all the time. I had her for 302 and she liked me so I took her for 308. If you're willing to suck up she will like you. You can not skip her class or she will not like you and you will notice she grades you harder. for your sanity avoid her,0
"His lectures are really great: he is always funny, but even his jokes have a purpose for the class. The fact that he give a lot or real-life examples makes the content easier to be absorbed. He will expect a lot from you so, if you are looking for a easy grader, he might not be a good choice. The worksheets are a golden study material",1
Sometimes hard to understand,1
"Very easy online course. You're graded on quizzes, a roughly 5 question assignment, and that's it. No exams. The quizzes are 20 questions each. There is quite a bit of text to read but I passed with an A not reading it all. Very simple and easy class/prof. She provided lectures and extra reading but I never used either for the class.",1
"She's an extremely kind woman and very passionate and intelligent about the subject matter. She's a little disorganized, her lectures are often all over the place, but you can still get a lot out of the class. If you like reading and discussing literature, this is perfect. She's super helpful over email as well and if you participate you'll be good",1
"If over 70% of your class fails both the midterm and the exam You're doing something wrong as a professor - not ""the students need to try harder and put more time into the course"" If you can switch to a dif prof, SWITCH BEFORE YOU FAIL TLDR: Worst Prof ever, switch or fail.",0
"if you have this teacher, don't even try to pay attention, just read the book.  That is all he does in classto teach anyways.",0
"Professor Bale is very organized! Online classes are sometimes a challenge to navigate, but not hers! Make sure to take lots of notes during lecture videos. Plenty of extra credit opportunities. Read her rubrics-they are very detailed on what her expectations are. Communicates frequently throughout the week. Gives feedback with every assignment.",1
"He was absolutely horrible, hes rude an mean, he threatened to grade our final assignment harder if we attempted to do part B of the exam if we dont understand it.",0
"Raudenbush is a tough professor for sure. Psych 115 is sort of a right of passage into the program at Jesuit, and should not be taken lightly. If you are a natural at math and SPSS, you will breeze by. If you struggle, Dr. Raudenbush isn't the most approachable guy to talk to. You can not avoid the class if you are a Psych Major, so be ready.",0
"Awful likes to preach about keeping an open mind but if a students has a differing world view that students is wrong or is just trying to be disruptive. Highly illogical, closed minded and rude. Does not like students bring outside knowledge or theories from other discipline in the classroom.",0
Probably the worst experience i had in this college was with this professor. Proceed with extreme caution!,0
This professor makes it nearly impossible for students to feel welcome and does not encourage participation. Student questions and commentary are shot down with condescending responses and looks of disgust. He is not the type of person that deserves to be working with young adults. Avoid his classes!,0
"Hardest, worst professor. Do not take her class if you can avoid it ",0
"Ok, if you can handle reading 11 HARD books in one semester, go for it. You really should, because he's the man. But these are HARD books we're talking about, make sure you're ready.",1
Her class was alright until it went online. Gave us repetitive group project worked and graded it harshly. Gave us a lot of busy work for no reason knowing we have other classes to work on. Wouldn't recommend.,1
"He makes a tremendous amount of mistakes so studying your notes is often useless. His incredible amount of homework (2-3 hours a day, 5 days a week) often has no relevance to the material that is on the tests. By far the worst teacher I've ever had. AVOID AT ALL COST!!! He is a GPA wrecker.",0
"Hrinca is the worst. Literally have to teach the entire course to yourself. He only reviews homework in class, you literally have to read the textbook and teach yourself the math, he does almost zero lecture in class, just pop quizzes and answers questions.",0
Cell Bio. Not a bad prof. The best option you have for cell. just keep up with the material because it is easy to fall behind. Try to be i class because he takes random attendance and will curve your grade based on how often you were there.,1
"Her exams are difficult but she points out which part u need to study specifically so u dont have to study every page of the textbooks. Expect some M/C, short answers and 4 super long answer (one page for each question). Excellent quality teacher ive ever seen.",1
WORSTTTTTTTTTTTTT              DO NOT TAKE HIMMMMMMM,0
"You'll end up sighing so many times in this class, whether it be from the boring black and white movies or waiting for Feng to get his extremely jumbled thoughts together. While the class is pretty easy, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. No papers to write so that's a plus, and the two projects are easy Otherwise, prepare for very unclear lectures",0
Prof wickham-Crowley is awesome. Lots of reading but that's a given (it's an English class). Makes some pretty dry pre 18th c lit bearable.,1
"Good teacher, interesting lectures. However the tests are difficult and he asks you to relate theories to one another (the answers are not obvious, he's tricky). Doesn't take attendance, but he'll ask you questions on the exam about stuff he ONLY talks about in class (ie We'd watch TED Talks and the exam essay question was about it) So go to class!",0
"One of my favorite professors -- great class.  She expects a lot, but is not unreasonable.",1
"Ms. Battista is not a fair grader. The online quizzes constitute a large portion of your grade; however, they are on material that is not covered or provided. Essentially, you are walking into the dark with no preparation or access to information, while being graded. The only way to do well on these quizzes is through luck.",0
"She's always trying ""new things"" which isnt good for her current class. Shes extremely boring and its hard to hang on to her lecture. Online quizzes help your grade a lot but i didnt enjoy her class at all. She has a tendency to treat you like a 5 year old. At the end of class to make sure you attend theres a 5 point participation assignment...",0
"She had extremely high expectations that were often not articulated clearly.  She regularly checked over our essays in front of the entire class, handing them back and snapping at students that made minor grammatical or format errors.  While she is extremely knowledgable on the subject, I found that she expected us to know much more than we did.",0
Take ACTG1040 and 1050 online...they are both really easy.  She gives so much extra credit it is hard not to get an A.,1
"loved this professor, his lectures are truly inspiring if you really listen to what he says. he provided test questions during lecture so you know exactly what will show up on the test!! super easy, and really funny when he isn't even trying to be. kind of like a funny grandpa you'd love to have and actually cares about his students",1
"Unorganized, had a bit of a problem with fulfilling promises.  Lectures weren't always the best to understand.",0
Nice gentleman overall.  Knows the material well and tells you what you expect from him.  His work focuses primarily on memory.  The papers are difficult but the skill comes with time and good feedback.  Clear voice and is pretty engaging and funny.  6% of grade was attendance..  Make sure to be in class on lab results days to get the SPSS Output.,1
"He teaches at SF state now. He gave daily readings and quizes the next morning on them. Final was easy; an essay and some multiple choice. The material taught in class was confusing and didn't seem to fit together, it was also one sided. If I didn't have to take this class as a GE I wouldn't have taken it. However he is passionate about politics",0
"Prof. Albrecht is definitely the best prof I've ever had. Most people on here who give him a low score either don't like his yelling or don't agree with the content he presents. He makes it very easy for you to pass his class if you show up and take notes, which are VERY clearly given to you. He repeats himself a LOT which helps with memorization.",1
hard grader,1
My perception of the HSIM program starting to change once because of this class.  I believe it was Dr. Kulesher's first time teaching this course but it was absolutely horrible! I can't recall learning anything except from the two 60 min videos we watched.  He also assigned us a 20 pg research paper and this is not a WI class.,0
as long as you pay attention and go to office hours you'll do fine,1
"Have her for Psy 271. she is flipping the classroom this semester so we play games every time. not helpful at all. refuses to answer questions in class. tests are hard and very confusing. 50 question hw assignment every week, same thing every week.",0
"Attendence in class is mandatory. Although she may seem extremely intimidating at first, shes actually very nice and caring for her students. Shes also a very fair grader. 2 essays and 1 final in the class (Although, she said she wont be giving a final next year). I got an A- in the class and i didnt know much about African Culture going in.",1
"A lot of group work, homework every class but isn't checked. Exams are tough and majority of final grade. Final is cumulative. She moves way too fast on topics, never covering a topic enough to fully understand it & assigns the rest of it for hw so we teach ourselves. Hard to talk to her & she doesn't seem to understand students confusion.",0
"I was nervous to take this class because of previous reviews, but I enjoyed the class and didn't find it to be that challenging. Just go to class, learn the material, study and you'll be fine!!",1
I LOVE HIM!,1
"Useless teacher. Had him for materials science. He talked at you and went through his slides so fast, if you blinked you missed them. His tests are impossible too. Everyone in my class only passed on his curve. Avoid at all costs",0
"He's a thoughtful and understanding person, but one of the few professors who I really think shouldn't be teaching. During lectures he bounces around a lot of different concepts which makes it difficult to follow. It's as if he's just saying whatever pops into his mind at the time. He didn't use a textbook either. So all we had are scribbled notes",0
"The curve is based on highest person, would've gotten a theoretical A if someone didn't get 100 on the MT... Took it P/NP anyways since my MT grade wasn't too great. Study fair game sheet fast and space it out. LOTS to memorize. Wouldn't recommend as a GE. Don't cram or procrastinate. Took it my first quarter, and his tests were tricky.",1
"This quizzes this man gives are more about semantics than economics. They would be easy except he has to make the wording as complicated as possible for simple questions. His lectures are fine, nothing extraordinary.",0
"Just horrible. Solutions are filled with mistakes and does a terrible job explaining the already difficult concept of thermo.  Smart guy, but can't explain anything.  Exam averages around 50 to 65.  Just try to do well on one exam and you're set.  Prepare to memorize your butt off for exam 2.  Beware the final project.  Its long",0
Professor Grenquist is one of the best teachers around. He really knows his stuff and he knows as well how to pass it on to the students. I wish every professor were like him.,1
"People need to realize that Mentis probably can teach, he just knows that most people who attend his class are not Comp Sci majors.  So yes the class is a joke, its supposed to be.  I think he could make the class alot harder if he wanted to so people need to quit whining",1
"I had to take him for the new English 303 class. He was incredibly rude and counted off tremendously on my papers. I got a  1925 points because of four ""missed"" commas. Honestly, he picks favorites and if you are not a favorite student of his you wont pass. Also,read the last chapter of the reading assignment that is where the test questions are.",0
"Awful course layout - 4 exams spread over the semester with term paper; also overemphasis on ""community service learning"" where you basically do academically-based volunteer work for organizations (How can this be worth 40%?). Lots of reading in this course as well, but that's to be expected for courses like this one. Lectures are incredibly dull.",0
"Nice guy, wants to do examples but gets sidetracked and forgets to finish example. His test are dialed down from material covered.  Overall, class is bs and shouldn't be required to graduate!!",0
"Prof DeYoung is wonderful! Child Maltreatment is a sad subject, but she gave so much insight into the topic! She is EXTREMELY knowledgeable in this field. I loved every minute of this class. This class helped figure out what I wanted to do with my life! I read about 75% of what was assigned, lestened in class, and got an A. YOU SHOULD TAKE HER!!!!!",1
"Worst class I have ever taken. Dull lectures that are don't even pertain to the exam. The book is dense and so hard to find information on. Whether I went to class or not, it didn't matter, still almost failed the exams. The only bright side is that the class is curved so much that you can slightly stay afloat.",0
"Don't even bother, change the professor if possible.  John Tyler needs a system of checks and balances when evaluating staff for teaching.  He walks and talks erratically around the room, scribbles nonsensical information on the board.  Best part, he's the only teacher who teaches the subject in class, maybe one other guy.  Steer clear, he's bad.",0
"He took way too long to grade things & never followed the syllabus. His class didn't seem to have any structure or purpose. He often arrived late. He has a tendency to come off as arrogant, rude, &condescending. I asked him roughly how many sources should we use for our paper. He said, ""I shouldn't have to tell a college student that."" Um what??",0
"If you are truly passionate about psychology, this class will be beneficial and rewarding. Although the only graded components of the class are an essay format midterm exam and final exam, Sarver leads a thought-provoking class that covers lessons applicable to any field of work, as well as personal life. Would absolutely recommend.",1
"This profesor is not good, she cant teach at all! When ever she lectures we have to correct her on everything. You pretty much have to teach yourself. Also you cant even understand her hand writing! The worst thing is that the exams contain nothing that she teaches us! Dont recommend!",0
"IF YOU NEED GOOD GRADES AVOID HIS CLASS LIKE THE PLAGUE. He def has a reputation, but since he's an icon of the school faculty, you won't get any criticism when you ask about him before you come here. There's a story of a guy who had 2 options w/Brinkley: A in his class, F's every other class; or F in Brinkley and A's every other class.",0
"The worst professor by far from my 4 years at concordia! Completely disorganized, and never posts things online for students. Turnaround time for grading is atrocious, takes forever to correct anything. Uses her own grading scale way disproportionate to concordia's and is often rude and snarky, avoid all her classes at all costs!!!",0
"STAY AWAY. going to class is painful the way she talks to the class is so irritating and slow and repetitive. Should be an extremely easy class but the speaker quizzes are impossible, the tests are hard and she is a ridiculously tough grader on written assignments. Overall such a waste of time NOT WORTH IT",0
"If you're someone without a life, a job, and a family and you have nothing better to do than study this is the class for you!!! You can spend hours upon hours studying, thinking you know every thing there is to know about it and you'll still do horribly on her impossible exams. Don't miss a lab! 6% auto deducted. ONLY positive: great curver!",0
"Scott gives metric tonnes of busy work and the grading system is very well laid out although not followed well. After having missed 3 classes and 3 zoom calls (during corona after having verified that I have no device that functions with zoom) I received a 68% for attendance. Class is a waste of time. A lot of giving speeches, no actual learning.",0
"Most scatterbrained prof ever. Notes seem helpful but looking at practice questions at the end of each section you realize she's left out 3/4 of the textbook. her tests are fair IF you've studied solely out of the textbook and taken down her in class questions. Mis-spells, mispronounces everything, sometimes test answers are wrong!",0
This is a great class for people who have jobs or if you are busy. The work is very clear and you will learn quite a bit. This class was smooth and not stressful at all.,1
"15A is a really challenging class and not for everyone. Be ready to dedicate A LOT of time and energy to the class. To do well, you must do all the readings and whatever you can to understand them. Before this class I was a decent writer, but Sims pushes you to be even better and gives incredible feedback. Do the revisions (they'll help ur grade!)!",1
"100 level course, yet we were asked to write 3 page papers weekly.  Course load is heavy, but then the midterm and final are the only time the text book was actually used in the class.  Graded strictly on grammar, and marked down for things that were direct quotes from citations.  I'm now in a 200 level writing course that requires less.",0
"unorganized and very hard to follow. I have never taken any coding/programming before so its such a struggle. never teaches just lets you figure it out on your own. don't get me wrong, hes a good guy and very nice but as a prof stay clear",0
Ms. Hickman is very sweet and an amazing teacher. She is clear when she assigns work and let's you know long before there is a test or quiz. She is young and very helpful. The class isn't too hard but not a total bore. It's engaging and she cares about how we learn. Wonderful woman and teacher. ,1
"Dr. Guerriero is such a sweetheart! Although her class is a little dry at times, she definitely knows what she is talking about, and I learned a lot in her class! I would definitely recommend her if you WANT TO TEACH special ed! If you want to teach gen ed, she may be a little boring to you.",1
"This professor gave me an extremely hard time. I have a great GPA and am very serious when it comes to my school work; however, this professor discouraged me with his sly comments, anger issues, and condescending attitude. He literally told us ""you don't know anything until I teach you"". He gave me a D after all the work I've done in his class. ",0
"Do not take SOC 346. It says SOC 101 is not a pre-req, but it is with the way he grades. I spent WAY too much time reading texts and doing assignments only to get slapped in the face with ANOTHER C. He won't take HW not turned in in class. He expects you to know these soc terms, but he doesn't EVER define them for you and EXPECTS you to use them.",0
Excellent class and excellent Professor. I highly recommend them both.,1
"Super Cool and funny. He definately knows his stuff. You have to read and study, but you'll be better for it.",1
"Great prof! Very approachable.  Gives opportunity to bring up grade through aplia assignments, lab attendance etc Assignment were also pretty easy!",1
"Great teacher, keeps things interesting and in perspective. Always willing to help students. And contrary to other comments, he does not humiliate people, make sure you're listening to the lecture, he'll ask questions about it in class occasionally.",1
"This teacher doesn't teach and is difficult to understand. I learn more by reading the textbook during class than by whatever problems he's going over on the board. His homework solutions to his assignments are never right, either. I tried to drop the class immediately after the syllabus day, and couldn't. Highly recommend taking another teacher.",0
"Barberio is a great professor. The material can be somewhat boring and confusing at times, but he does his best to make it relatable to the students. He is a really nice guy and has a great teaching ability. I would recommend any class with him!",1
Hated this class. Worst class I ever took. Don't take it with Insall. Way more work than it should be. He expects you to spend more time on work in this class than the rest of your more important classes. This class killed my 4.0. If you take this class just make sure you don't get insall.,0
"Jim starts off like a good guy, pretty serious and all, but has mood swings like a woman.  Can be very unhelpful when you need him sometimes.  Gives students he likes, a lot more time with him, but always marks fairly!  Overall a 4 out of 5!",1
"This class could've  been really interesting, but the mixture of off topic monotone lectures and the ridiculous grading scale made it horrid.  60% of the class grade was papers, which he graded outrageously and unfairly.  Save time and tuition...take another class!",0
"Hi prof, constructive criticism time: you didn't adapt your course for remote delivery, just posted low-quality videos from last year. Also, grading 3/5 assignments but not telling us until after is ridiculous. Essentially, you're telling us that your time matters more than ours when you can't take 20 min to grade something we worked on for a week",0
"He is a nice guy, but should not be teaching. If you're looking to enroll in this retail course, take another professor. In comparison to others, this class is much more difficult. Usually I would be OK with this, but I don't feel like I'm learning much.",0
"A very good teacher, won't give away answers but points you in the right direction. I had him for programming and I had no problem with the course!",1
"I cannot stand this woman. The class is easy, but she is awful to her students. In her online course, if someone asks for help she wont answer them, only say things like ""this cannot be any clearer"" and leave it alone. SHe is persumptuous and egotistical, and an overall snobby and elitist person. i don;t know how she got her job. F-",0
One of the main things I remember from his class is that he would always stop after every concept and ask if he needed to rephrase something. He begged for people to ask questions but no one would. His lectures aren't confusing if you participate & ask questions. He made study guides for tests because someone asked if he would. He cares a lot.,1
"Mr. Bobby is a funny, caring, and supportive guy. He wants his students to do well. He is tough because it is a tough subject. You have to do your part and be prepared by doing the homework every night. He also requires you to memorize all the formulas which may be difficult for some. In all, hes very helpful and does his best. DONT. BE. LATE.",1
"Took his Saturday 8am class, the lectures are long but if you browse the material during the week it isn't that bad. The tests are pretty clear cut, you do have to study though. He is caring and willing to work with you to make sure you learn the material. The labs are short but entertaining. If you don't get an A it's all on you.",1
holy sh*t! never managed to get one question completely right on any test -- also never managed to get over a 35% on any of them.  still pulled a C- cuz he's afraid of failing people; damn ELEG majors have the advantage in this one,0
"H. Is absolutely the best professor I've ever had at Kenyon. I'm a bio major, so I didn't know what to expect from his class, but he makes it great. Incredibly enthusiastic, funny, and extremely helpful (even gives you his cell# so you can text him questions). He's remarkably well-versed, and can answer pretty much any question you can think of.",1
"He's been at this a long time, but he does know his stuff. He is little rough around the edges, but thats just Boyd. He does sometimes get the tests a little mixed up but he goes over it with you, and will correct anything problems you find and apologize. If he picks on you dont take it personally, by the end of the semester everyone gets picked on",1
Elle a complÃ¨tement dÃ©truit tout dÃ©sir que j'avais d'Ã©tudier la politique.,0
"Professor Good was by far my favorite professor during my first semester. All though the content can be rather dry at times, he still tries his best to make it interesting. The more you participate in the assigned material the more interesting class will be. He is a fair grader and gives good feedback. Listen in class and you will do well.",1
"Really interesting class, if you keep up you'll learn a lot. He cares about the students, but doesn't make it easy. KEEP UP WITH ALLLLLL THE READING!",1
"I took the hybrid class.  He kept everything up to date on D2L and sent e-mail reminders when an assignment was due.  The assignments are easy to get full credit on.  The tests are matching and multiple choice, but he grades on a curve.  Be sure to study the book and the notes for the tests.",1
"Hard teacher. Sister took this class, she did something to make him mad at her, when I took this class, he took it out on me!",0
"He is fast-paced. Gives you very little time to work on a subject in the text. You have to ask him questions or he won't explain it in detail. He is too focused on doing math the fast way instead of explaining why the answer is what it is and how he got there. He knows his math just doesn't teach it well, many dropped.",0
Dr. Sernoe is overall a great teacher. He doesn't tolerate tardiness or unexcused absences. The class is very easy if you do the work & go to class everyday.,1
She does not prepare you the at all for anything. As a result the class has a failing average!SWITCH OUT if you have the chance!,0
Handles online classes very well. Good at encouraging participation. Fast grader and very helpful in office hours. I took JAPN 1001 and it was a lot of work but taking it with Matsushima sensei made it easier and more enjoyable.,1
"Very hard to comprehend what he's saying. Attendance in manditory each class period. Final test along with two 1,500 word essays are 50% of grade. Calls on people in class and makes them look stupid. AVOID THIS CLASS.",0
Professor Hanna was awesome. I really enjoyed taking his class and listening to him speak. He has so much knowledge on the content he is talking about. You will have essays every week and discussions but if you do your work and make sure your work is cited correctly you cannot fail. He is very laid back and helpful. I would take his class again.,1
"Prof. Renner treats her students like children. Her class is not explicitly difficult and if you read and follow along, you'll do fine, but she simply is not a good instructor. Lectures littered with personal opinions and little backing. Mandatory attendance for a 300 level course. Won't let her students leave to get water during class. Ridiculous.",0
Course is very comprehensive but examples are clear and extremely helpful. Professor is very helpful and clarifies any questions.,1
"Really good at explaining abstract ideas and concepts. Reasonable understanding guy. Very engaging teacher. However he is tough (but again reasonable) grader and you will have to work hard in his courses, but you will learn lots. Highly Recommend.",1
"Hands down the BEST professor I have ever had. He's clear with his lectures and knows what he's talking about. Not to mention he keeps class fun in his own way, AND he explains his content VERY thoroughly and clearly to where it CAN be understood. He makes his own jokes and puts it into the material. And not the kind of jokes you would expect. diff",1
"Dr. Sundahl's online Great Books class on Job was lucid, reaffirming and inspirational.  Job repents in dust  ashes because he's stayed true to the Holy Spirit and sees through this material veil to Man's Redeemer  God's omnipotent Holiness  purpose.   One is grateful to truth guides. Thank you, Dr. Sundahl",1
Best math instructor I have EVER had. I began the class feeling like a dunce for not knowing math. He made it so easy I passed the class with a 3.5.,1
"Constance Pilkington was a horrible professor. She is the worst at William & Mary. She ignores emails, randomly cancels tests, has long boring lectures, bases the grade off of 3 tests, has terrible notes and is a very mean woman. Please don't take any course from her. My friends in the same class with a different professor aced it. Constance sucks.",0
If you need this online class  TAKE IT! He post all assignments at the start. You can work at your own pace. He writes his own book so evert thing you need to pass is right there.. Take this class,1
"Teacher only has you write 3 essays, but is a tough grader and if you skip peer review or don't have the exact number of pages she expects, you cant redo the essay. The first essay is about 4 pages the second 6 and the third 10, if you don't meet these requirements you will get a zero. Very strict on essay grading, you need to know how to cite work",1
"Extremely easy class but TONS of homework. You basically have an assignment every night that has three parts. Its a lot of work but if you have to take the course and are willing to work, take it.",1
"I took Confucianism with Prof. Keyworth on a friend's recommendation, and boy was I not disappointed! His lectures are engaging, he is incredibly knowledgeable and helpful, and got me interested in the content. It even changed my worldview. I highly recommend talking to him outside of class, he is very approachable!",1
"I loved Dr. Biester's class! The poems we read were super interesting and he really helped us develop better analytical skills. I rarely participate in class, but I this was the only class I've ever felt comfortable enough in to speak up. And he makes adorable dad jokes, which is another plus!! 10/10 would take again",1
I really didn't like this professor. The lectures are very detailed and the exams often have questions that weren't covered in class. The final project is pretty hard. I would not recommend taking this prof. He's probably the worst prof I've ever had. TAKE SOMEONE ELSE.,0
Holmes is actually a good teacher. He is pretty inaccessable outside of class and gives alot of homework but I have to admit that he explains the material pretty clearly and gives out worksheets ALOT to help reinforce the learning. If your a person who needs continual practice to fully understand topics he is your guy.,1
"A very kind professor who does her best to engage with her students. Be wary if you have attention problems, though: especially in her online lectures, she has a droning voice that can make it difficult to focus on what she's actually trying to tell you.",1
"Questions are all ""Which answer is the most correct"", so all the options are correct you just have to choose which one she thinks is the best.",0
"Absolutely horrible. Been at Housatonic 3 years and was the only professor I hated. He is combative and will humiliate you then explain why it makes him a good teacher. Talks about his opinions all class and theres absolutely nothing to keep you focused, just lectures on about his life. Im ashamed that this school keeps this guy as a professor",0
"He's a good English teacher, just assigns a lot work so be prepared",1
"Each student interprets things differently and even if you get the concept of the material right, it's like she grades you low if you don't word things EXACTLY how she sees fit. I'm a great writer, but even I struggled with nailing every assignment due to her tough grading. My other 400 level Psych classes were a breeze compared to her class.",0
"This is by far the worst professor I've had. I would never recommend him to ANYONE. He doesn't respond to emails right away & when he does he's completely ignorant. He has everyone in groups. How do you do group work online? I think he thinks his students sit at the computer & do nothing else with in life, except this class. He's a complete JOKE.",0
"No practice goes ungraded!!! tough class, and she beats the hell out of the inverted pyramid.  IDK... just didn't learn a lot, but she is a great person. she has a fun class, and her AP style quizzes are easy.  So that's good.",1
"Lectures are tedious and seem completely unnecessary, yet are the main focus of the class for some reason. The lab is fine, but instructions are often unclear and I found myself coming in outside of class far more often than any other I've had. It is hard to understand him at times and this makes communication a struggle.",0
"Dr. Strangelove is a great professor. The only people who don't take away something from this class are the ones who don't try to. You have to come in with an open mind, and if you do, you can learn a lot. The workload is a little heavy since there's a lot of writing but follow the instructions and you should be good.",1
"Expect to not get higher than a B. She has too many high expectations and will grade you off of her own vague rubric. I went to her several times and she did not give me any advice on how to succeed and make changes. No matter what, this class will make you anxious and make you feel insane.",0
"I've had 2 classes with Cairnie and found her great in both. She's kind of a hard marker, but always willing to meet with students and discuss assignments and help you understand better. One of the best UoG profs for actually learning the important theory, her classes helped me do better in my others.",1
"Best professor I ever had at Eastern so far. She keeps your attention and is so smart, her vocabulary is amazing. As long as you go to class and pay attention, you can definetly get A's on all her exams, and she's willing to sit with you to go over and issues you have...I reccomend her to anyone interested in art history!!",1
"He was a niceish person, but he refused to do anything online. I had him for a hybrid class and he wouldn't even put our test scores and grades on canvas, he would make US keep track of our grade. He was confusing and the most boring person to listen to in the world. Would not recommend ever.",0
"The course contents, discussions, and readings were well-prepared. The topic discussed in class were fun. Very good communicator and moderator. The guest lecturers gave practical information and completed the theories given in the class. The feedback given was useful.",1
"I had a three hour into business class with him and it was a pain to sit through. He likes to tell a lot of uninteresting and off-topic stories. He does offer a lot of extra credit clicker questions, but they seem to be just because our class struggles. Very unorganized, and it's unlikely to hear back from him within the week if you send an email.",0
"I found he kept the course material very interesting with the sources and lecture slides he posted. It is a very heavy reading course, but if you stay on top of things it's an easy A. You'll be able to learn about many things that you can apply to your daily life.",1
"Don Nichol, gives clear and constructive feedback. If you attend class regularly you will get more out of the course. What makes the classes even more interesting is that he talks about the social context surrounding a text. He is genuinely interested in students as contributors to class, not as an inactive dummies in a seat being talked at.",1
"I didn't like how he pressured participation. If you go to class and take the notes and follow the practice problems, things make sense. But you do two tax returns and he doesn't at all teach you how what you're learning applies, you just 'read the IRS instructions'. The practice problems also don't help fully with tests, unfamiliar wording/format.",0
"No assignments for 6 weeks, a couple of weeks with normal workload, and then suddenly slammed with oral exams and tests and compositions. Doesn't respect her students, seems to believe that any problems learning stem from them, not her teaching style. Says (in writing) that material won't be on a quiz and then it is. Worst prof I've ever had. AVOID",0
"Very absent-minded professor. Be prepared to do absolutely nothing all semester...until a 20-page paper and a 30-minute presentation. If that's your style, take it. If you want your work to be evenly spread throughout the semester (like me) then look elsewhere. Thankfully, the class was only once a week.",0
She is a tough grader.,0
He is challenging but understanding. Homework only requires you to read and make an effort for full credit. The quizzes on the readings are tough but he drops low grades. I felt stressed about my quiz grades and thought I was doing poorly but when I looked at my grade I was doing fine. Its the kind of class where if you try to pass.,1
"SO nice, but information spills out of his mouth like a waterfall. Difficult to follow, but his class is passable. Easy B.",1
PSY 101 was the toughest class I've ever taken. Quizzes are absolutely terrible and take forever to do online. Avoid this class if possible. She's super nice but bad professor.,0
"- Is not clear - Gives a research paper, early in class time - The big paper at the end of the class is really hard because we barely practiced doing long and detailed lexical analysis, we spent more time talking about material from the book (which is only relevant on the midterm and final) - Comments on papers aren't nice if paper isn't an A",0
Wonderful insight...helpful and challenging,1
"Luallen is by far the most difficult professor I've had at Tufts. Although he is a really nice guy who clearly enjoys teaching economics, he prides himself on being the most difficult teacher for the course and his tests are very challenging. I would definitely not recommend taking his section of microeconomics.",1
This professor is awesome! One of the most kind and compassionate ones who actually cared about YOU and your academics. He is very warm to students and classes are always something to look forward to. You learn a lot of material in such a short period and he is there helping you right along. Very stress free and laid back environment. ,1
"Good guy, but HE CAN'T TEACH. Makes you watch YouTube videos. His very unorganized. Course exams questions and project exams questions are so unclear. You never know what he wants you to do. He expects you to read 30-50 pages SQL code and master it by next class without clear explanations of concepts. Beware if you take him for 331",0
"Easiest class I have ever taken. All the tests are online and they are taken at home, open book, even the final. It is an easy A!",1
"Her exams are mostly true and false with very few multiple choice. She was super hard to understand, and I didn't understand anything. She made the class unnecessarily hard. She also tends to go off on a tangent most of the time, so students tend to take advantage of that. Make sure to read the book and take notes. Overall, very hard so good luck.",0
"Lectures are very dry, and she rambles through the material is an unorganized way without giving you any idea how to solve problems on exams/problem sets. Puts in zero effort to making the course somewhat interesting. You're better off reading the textbook than going to her lectures. 20% midterm 1, 30% mid 2, 40% final, 10% psets. Recommend against",0
Great Prof! Really inspired interest in the course material. Would definitely take one of his classes again. He really cares about student learning.,1
"Not a great course, but a great prof.",1
"If you have little to no other classes or work then it maybe it is easy to keep up with Dr wilsons classes,as I'm taking 2 of them concurrently but there is an unreasonable amount of work and information to absorb that makes passing his classes almost unrealistic,he is very knowledgable,but the way he teaches concepts seems unneseccarily difficult.",0
Do not expect to learn anything worthwhile from this professor...unless of course you worship Freud and believe sex is the answer to everything.  Its a whole lot of memorization for nothing.  However if you do not take life seriously and want to take a class simply so you can laugh at other peoples bizarre ideas then go for it....,0
He is awful. I took pre-calc in high school so I wasn't too worried about this class. He says attendance isn't mandatory but if you want to leave he interrogates you. I have to teach myself everything.. The SI is very useful and she is the only reason I did decent on the exams. Save yourself the frustration and don't take his class.,0
"Solid professor, he cares about his teaching and is passionate about biology. You might find his lectures funny, or you might find them dry, regardless he's good at synthesizing large amount of material into a more reasonable slide show sets. Goes at a good pace and encourages participation and getting to know his students, would gladly take again!",1
Mark is a great teacher and a really nice guy. He made me not hate math and actually made sure the class understood the material we needed to know before we moved on. Very fair on all tests and extremely helpful anytime you need it. Great teacher.,1
"Great Prof, had a lot of enthusiasm for the course. I'd love to have him as a Prof in the future.",1
"Tough class to do online. Reading is endless, he doesnt seem to care about most students. Talks about inappropriate topics, we had a survey about our sex life that was worth a portion of your grade so not really optional. Discussion assignments are worth 2-5% but are very time consuming. Avoid this class and the prof if possible.",0
"I am a history major and never received below a B on any paper or class but I constantly struggled in Benson's class. He is passionate but he leaves nasty comments on your papers or test, he even told me to stop coming to class becuase im clearly a lost cause. My GPA before his class was a 3.87 in my Junior year.",1
"A lot of people complained about this class, but I didnt mind it. On Wednesday we had large lecture with Ball, then on Friday we were in smaller classrooms with GAs. The smaller classrooms are where the 2 group presentations were done. Attendance is mandatory for the Friday session, but not really for lecture. You have weekly reading quizzes that",1
Professor Long spent the majority of the semester discussing politics. The two speech's that had to be done were left till the last two weeks of the semester. Avoid her at all cost.,0
"please avoid this prof, one of the worst professor i ever had",0
Love this teacher,1
Bon prof pour raconter sa vie et nous montrer comment il a de lexperience mais il croit que les etudiants devraient etre a son niveau ! Ses examens ne refletent pas la matiere et ils sont hyper longs ! Beaucoup de comptabilitÃ© ! En gros je vous conseil un autre prof sil en existe un mieux .....,0
"I was really expecting to love this class. Man was I wrong. You would expect the lectures to go with the test, but that is not the case. Unfortunately I learned the hard way by the end of the semester and now I am fighting my way to a C. He is a really nice guy and he knows what he talking about. He just needs to slow down a bit and go by the book.",0
"I usually wait until the end of the semester to review teachers but so far, Alice has been the BEST online class I HAVE EVER TAKEN. She is helpful, friendly, understanding, and even at 12AM, responds to emails lightning fast!! What is clear: she cares deeply about her students and genuinely wants them to succeed. Thank You Professor Stevens!!",1
worest professor ever,0
He is the most specific grader i've ever had. his lectures are good and you'll understand the concepts but his grading on tests is enough to drive you crazy. You have 4 tests and a final and one of the tests are dropped (if he didnt drop your lowest grade you wouldnt pass). try and take someone else,0
"Decent professor, loves to walk around the room and talk (read:yell) about what he's teaching. Taking both Microeconomics and Accounting with this class made it feel extremely repetitive and almost useless Touches upon a lot of business aspects but I wouldn't say this class will make you love or hate a certain concentration. All tests are open book",1
Delightful,1
"He is a very nice person, professional, friendly, encouraging, caring and always pays attention that students understand the concept, the core of the course. His explanation sometimes sounds unclear, especially when you are half asleep (most of his classes start at 8AM), but if you pay attention you'll realize how reasonable what he says.",1
"The textbook is easily found online in PDF form! It isn't too important, but helps grasp concepts better and it's a good read. Professor Bullock explains the concepts very well too. His class is very rarely boring. There are 2 essays and 2 tests, none of which are very hard. I definitely recommend any class with this professor!!",1
Amazing professor but I don't unders Her bad reviews. You will Lear a lot.,1
Actually the worst teacher I have ever had. Not organized at all and will send you updates about the homework before the night it is due. Lectures don't correlate to the homework or tests at all. The homework is just busy work that takes over 2 hours and you will learn nothing from it and will receive a 4/10. NOT UNDERSTANIDING TO ONLINE SWITCH.,0
"Mrs. Wang is the best math professor ever, no kidding/exaggeration. Her lectures are perfectly concise and she will do ANYTHING to help you master the material. She set up study halls on Saturdays for students who wanted to come in for more help (everyone benefiting from everyone else's questions). Correct ur mistakes on tests for half credit.",1
"Such a great prof. Extremely helpful with assignments and tests. No problems with availability and she actually responds to your emails the same month that you send them (other profs...). I would absolutely recommend her, probably the best prof I've had.",1
"I could kick myself for taking this class AFTER reading the poor ratings on ratemyproffessor.com thinking that maybe the reviews were reflective of poor students and the fact this is the only online class for 2071. NOPE, the reviews are dead on.  The syllubus even warns not to harrass the instructor.  Illuminating!",0
"While this class was difficult, you WILL be quite prepared to teach in an urban setting. Professor Manski is an excellent gauge on a student's readiness to go inside an actual classroom. Although there is room for growth and I have my entire teaching career ahead of me, I am much more confident in my ability to be successful in the classroom.",1
Horrible instruction. She rather talk about her personal life than explain what the class is doing wrong since apparently we make so many mistakes. She has handed out three pages so far and has not discussed any of the questions we answered for a grade. gives prompt for two passages to choose then pushes off the book never to talk about it again.,0
Leidig is a great prof with tons of experience and knowledge.  Get used to his method of discussions and answer the essay exams just like class and you'll do fine.  This was the best class in the IS program because of how he ties everything together.,1
"Conscientious, involved, helpful, and bright. I had him in 1993 and still remember him, which is a good sign.",1
Professor Martin is kind and funny! She is energetic and not boring at all. She is understanding and makes you feel comfortable. I took her in Fall 2019. She reminds me of a fun aunt. There's not a lot of work she assigns but a couple of quizzes. You will have to work in groups sometimes and present speeches in class.,1
Presents things in a clear and concise manner.  Is very friendly and seems to enjoy teaching the class.,1
"Ali is one of the best teachers York has.  I actually looked for his name when choosing my classes this year.  He is so helpful and approachable, he genuinely cares for the welfare of his students.  He makes the material interesting so you hardly notice that you are learning - but you learn so much in his classes.",1
"Honestly, she's a very sweet teacher and sarcastically funny but thats about it. If you see yourself as a person who wants to succeeded in life, take another professors course unless, your being forced to go to school and could simply care less about it than, this is the class for you. Please avoid if you enjoy being educated.",0
If there is another professor for this course take him (or her). He only explains subjects in ways that he can understand but leaves the rest of the class confused. He answers questions harshly and is not the friendliest guy. He weights his tests a lot so if you do poorly on one test it will really affect your grade. Tests are extremely difficult.,0
"Super dry sense of humor, but she's hilarious. Go to every class, participate at least once each time, and you'll get a B doing maybe 3 hours of work all semester. This lady is awesome.",1
"Great professor. Attendance is required, but she likes group discussion participation so each day one person takes notes for the whole class and puts them on blackboard after Spaeth grades them (very helpful). Tons of information to cover but very interesting and well put together class. Would love to take another class with her.",1
"I enjoyed Professor Casada and the way he ran his online Psychology class. There's an online book you'll need to purchase but no need for the hard copy unless you want it for reference material. Straightforward, lots of questions on hw & tests but you'll learn better for it. Interactive with class discussions to participate in & quick to reply.",1
"I've taken her twice and probably will again. She makes sitting in a dark room staring at pictures fun! Don't ever leave class early though, she will take you outside and rip you a new one. Same goes for ""sleeping in class"" The exams are intense but there is minimal reading. Take her!",1
"This man looooves to waste trees and give the most amount of worksheets. In my opinion, this class is a very easy A, but the material on homework, quizzes, and tests is very inconsistent. He is very scatter-brained and all over the place with his explanations. He's funny and all, but I learned nothing about how to teach kids math",0
"Straight-A student for a year and a half before this class. This class was so difficult for me and I'm usually good in history. His study guides were so inconsistent with the tests and lectures. He gets too distracted and doesn't focus on the materials asked on the tests. He was especially bad during the COVID-19 situation, no online experience.",0
"This prof deters people from linguistics. The classes were extremely boring. His slides are straight from the textbook and he lectures directly off the slides. No point in going, just read the slides and memorize the textbook. Tests obscure, irrelevant details on MC exams. Thinks way too highly of himself. ",0
Professor B shoves the cheating policy on every email so harshly that I wouldn't be surprised if some students ratted themselves out even though they were 100% honest on their work. Do the homework and use the software and you will do fine. Quizzes become way easier with the software. Other reviews say he was rude but I never experienced that.,0
"Clear this guy's not very into teaching, lazy, this guy shouldn't be teaching.",0
"He's really nice and will help if you ask, but I can't promise that it will actually benefit you. He reads right off the slides and gets lost in thought a lot. He posts the slides online along with review questions for tests. I wouldn't recommend. but if you DO take his class, teach yourself using the textbook -it's the only way I passed!",0
"Professor Rashid is really kind and caring. She really cares about her students and does a good job and presenting the material in both Spanish and English, for the most part. I think she's a fair grader, and so much fun! I very much enjoyed her class.",1
"The class corrects him everyday on his arithmetic. He makes the lesson wayyy harder than it needs to be, but the webwork is quite easy. I wouldn't recommend him because of his grouchiness and his dislike of elementary ed. majors. He loves to write on the board with dead markers.",1
"She was a great teacher. we watched a lot of movies which are not all that great, but she was a funny teacher. I recomend this class. she is not a crazy man hating woman and she makes many great points.",1
"Does nothing to make the class interesting, or more helpful. Once class starts its a lecture straight to the end. I've had this course with another professor who did a much better job, and actively tried to engage students and did his best to make sure they understood. Halfway trough the course most students stopped coming to class",0
Hasn't been relevant this century. He should have stayed retired and spared all of his students his unrealistic expectations and archaic thinking.,0
"He is a nice prof, encourage people to think, if you really want to learn something, choose him. but if you just want a easy course, don't go with him. The exam is quite hard, class avergae is pretty low. but he is a easy marker on essay, and the essay average is exremely high.",1
"I don't understand how he grades the tests, but it is so confusing every time I received my grade. Never told you the formate of term tests and exams. Although marks assigned on each question (multiple choice) are equally weighted, the level of difficulty has not matched the marks.",0
"Wants you to learn for sure. However, she vaguely explains things and then gets mad when we don't understand them. Especially when we don't get things right, she seems offended. Vague explanations, doesn't like if we think an article is not too good, definitely has preferred or favored students. Sure I failed the class already despite my efforts.",0
Great professor and he's very kind. Attendance and participation is important though. Very understanding!,1
"Easy class if you do the study guides. Test questions are given on the first day for the whole semester. Gives great examples and is willing to explain more if needed. Always goes over the readings very thoroughly. I would take his class again. Has a preference for the students who speak often--if he knows your name, you're in good shape.",1
"Hes not a bad professor, if you pay attention youll pass. If you participate youll get an A. My problem was with his lectures hes very encryptive. But when it came to the midterm and final he it was a lot less confusing, and its one of those finals that youll pass if you have been doing the readings.",1
I loved Dr. Godshalk!  It has been so many years...and I only remember a few professors and he is one of them.  He is a great prof and a great guy too.  Take him for a class if you have the opportunity.,1
Don't,0
challenging but fair. really works with students who have technology problems,1
"I have never had a more confusing professor. Before his class I got straight A's. He lectures next to none, expects you to read and teach yourself, and quizzes you on things he never went over. He spends a great deal of time expounding on his foreign language skills, his revered teaching methods, and little time actually teaching. Take anybody else",0
I only lasted the first two classes to get an impression that her class was not for me. She reads everything WORD FOR WORD from her power point. It would be easier if she posted all the notes online for students to print and just follow along. She seems to get easily flustered when asked simple questions. I would not recommend this teacher,0
"He's one of those teachers where you either like him or you don't honestly. He has a ton of notes, but he lays them out pretty nicely. Bit of a tough grader, but the class is more difficult to begin with. Study his notes (especially the pathology ones) and study hard. Lectures are really fun though",1
"He has good personality and is willing to help you. However, he did not prepare IFRS material and is VERY disorganized. Sometimes he teaches IFRS and yet sometimes it's GAAP..extremely confusing. Does not show effort in making complex material easier to understand. I did not learn much from his 321..might have to redo.. NOT RECOMMENDED for 321",0
"One of the best profs I have ever come across.  Truly cares about what he is teaching and the well-being of his students.  He goes the extra mile to make this work for his students, is always available to meet if you just send an email, and is always willing and wanting to teach you.  Best of all, he understands that mental health is a priority.",1
"He assigned us 3 projects. We could only get A's if we completed all three perfectly, and he gave no tests. He often refused to help with code we were stuck on, saying ""if I tell you what to do, you won't learn."" (I learned close to nothing). Repetitive lectures on random topics. Had us follow Microsoft tutorials instead of really teaching content.",0
"most classes, he came off as very rude in regards to how he communicates. talks over you and -- which can make the classroom setting unsettled. aside from that, do your work and show up to class, and your grade for that class should be fair.",0
She is one the best lecture professors at CSULA but she is brutal when it comes to her tests and assignments. Her tests are multiple choice and rest is scenario questions. She will combine every thing she lectured into one question multiple parts. She does curve but depends on the highest grade in the class. She is very helpful during her office.,0
Would not take her classes ever again. Her lectures are all over the place and her tests make no sense. She tells you what types of questions are going to be on the test and then they are completely different. Save yourself the stress and don't take this class if she's teaching it. The material is great and totally interesting but not with her.,0
"He is a great professor. It's hard to not pay attention in class because his material is very interesting and he always tries to apply it to real life. He also throws random jokes. Regarding the grade, you can get an easy A by just paying attention in class and going through the study guide. I got an A and never bought the book.",1
I am generally a very competent student; I have done well with my classes up till now. Ams just does a terrible job explaining things in class. He makes frequent mistakes in lectures. He is very unsympathetic to students who struggle and made me feel like an idiot at office hours. My classmates tell me that he is very unavailable for them.,0
The worst prof. I have ever had and that is saying something. He doesn't know what he is doing. Didn't even know how to do a quiz problem when asked in class. He reads out of the book and never did examples in class (probably bc he didn't know how to do them). Can't believe they hired him. DO NOT TAKE HIM!,0
PSY1102 is a self teaching class basically. Prof doesnt do much tbh but shes very kind and accomodating. I once had internet trouble and missed my quiz and she opened it again just for me which is very nice. Bad thing about the course is purchasing the textbook (which is a must) from tophat and its expensive. Lectures are short-uselessjustreadbook,1
"Majority of the grade comes from participation, so it's important to speak up in class. Tests are oral, which actually ended up being easier than written. I took four years of spanish in high school and took this class as a freshman and had no real difficulty, so if you're confident in your abilities I highly recommend this class- Melvy is awesome!",1
"I absolutely love Professoressa Miller. She's very open about students asking questions and really makes everyone interact/participate. It did feel somewhat intimidating to try speaking Italian with others or aloud, but she knows how to make you feel at ease. You do need to put in some effort but overall, very easy.",1
"The better professor's class was full so I had to take Felber. She is a very strict grader. I'm a senior and have never encountered such harsh grading. Sociolinguistics can be a challenging subject. Don't add to that difficulty a teacher who subtracts points for petty, nonsubstantial reasons. If you must take the class, choose someone else.",0
"Because of my compass test score I had to take this class (and 0950) as a refresher before I could take the required College Algebra class, though the 0### classes don't count for credit. Professor Yuen was kind and tried hard to make jokes and engage students. Her thick accent sometimes complicated the lessons, but overall she was great!",1
"Literally THE best professor Ive ever had.  Behind his gruff Southern republican exterior hides one of the most intelligent men Ive known.  A rapier wit and a dead shot with a water gun, he has taken shots at Shannon Faulkner and at sleeping cadets.  You will want to stay awake in this class.  Kill if you have to to take his class.",1
"She is an amazing teacher , you will like her class . she makes it easy to everybody , she helps you to pass the class and get good grade ,just do the homework she gives and attend the class and you will be good. Any thing you need in the class or with your homework she will absolutely help you . I recommend every body to take the class with her .",1
"Dont be fooled by his ratings. Hardest and most confusing prof. If your off by one little thing, he marks the question wrong. Mid term is 30% and Final is 30%. His handwriting is impossible to read. He doesnt use canvas so you wont know your grade. He doesnt have power points or gives notes of the information. GPA killer for sure",0
You teach yourself. I noticed similar test questions from the quizlet website. Read the book. The book Mr. Goode uses is actually interesting. Mr. Goode is funny sometimes but I do not do well with his lecture style. He's very smart but rambles on about things that aren't even on the test. ,0
"He wasn't great at explaining things, but he wasn't terrible by any means, either. If you pay close attention to what he's saying, you should be fine. He's also really funny.",1
He is literally the worst teacher i've ever had in my life. If you have your computer make sure you don't have anything up but a word document. I had something set up for class that i needed to screen shot in another browser and he kicked me out because of it. And told me I was stupid and he didn't want to hear my explanation as to why it was up.,0
"Dr. Yamazaki is so far the most knowledgeable, interesting, and informative professor I have met. In her class,YOU WILL LEARN. Do not underestimate her class though, you have to write everything she says down, doesn't matter what, just write it down, trust, it will save you later. Exams and finals free response. If you want an A, study everything.",1
"Very smart professor, he knows his stuff. HOWEVER, uses far too much jargon right out the door causing much confusion amongst students. Gets upset when you answer a questions incorrectly. Almost seems as though he expects his students to already know how to do everything before the semester starts. Overall: Far too difficult.",0
"The online textbook and practice quizzes ARE VERY HELPFUL. USE THESE RESOURCES!! Her lectures are quite interesting and helpful. Instead of a cumulative final, we had three quizzes spread out evenly throughout the term worth 30% each, all mc. Honestly, the easiest course I've had so far. Take the negative reviews with a grain of salt.",1
"Anne's lectures were very long and dense. There were a lot of papers to write that had a lot of weight on your grade. The study sessions with the TAs before the tests were really helpful- they literally give you all the answers in order, so go to those and just copy everything down then memorize it and you'll pass the test.",0
"Sara is one of the most amazing women that I've ever met! She is so passionate about what she is teaching and you can tell that she really cares about her students! If you have a little bit of background, you don't have to attend class to get a good grade but I found myself excited to go to class because her lectures so interesting.",1
"I loved this class.  Dr. Corsi is a great way to start the day.  He explains the books and helps you get through the story.  Just try to speak up in class, he loves it when people participate.",1
"Bruce is not a great lecturer. he can often go off on tangents, it was difficult to understand the class content. he went off of his experience, which didnt always to what you think the class is about. tests were on the most obscure details about the things we talked about, which made them difficult as it seemed nothing he talked about was relevant",0
"The textbook (that he wrote) is full of errors. He doesnt grade based on right answers. Miss a period or comma you get docked 50 points. Spell one word wrong, another -50 points. He doesnt care if you know the material he cares how well you can copy from the book and lectures verbatim. The actual math is the least important part of the class.",0
"interesting lectures, gives many examples  you have to study and go to class for TLEs",1
Awesome teacher and easy to learn with her. She knows how the students want to learn and gets us involved.,1
"Most sporadic, unorganized professor ever. Not clear, changes her mind. Your grade is dependent on whether or not she likes you, emphasizes group work then will give members of the group different grades. Plays favorites. Rudest person I've ever met ",0
Very helpful and knowledgable.,1
"Horrible. Do not take period. One quiz had an insane hard problem. No way to study for it. Smart book takes way too much time. Double work, online and his. Doesn't grad anything. No idea where you are in the class. Doesn't explain the lab. Lecture heavy, but you are still lost. Had to withdrawal. Will take with Tang, he was much better for Chem 2.",0
"Every lecture goes extremely fast. I went to every single class, he went through the slide too fas to follow. There are lots of terminologies and abbreviations, so it is very difficult for people with limited bond trading experience. The slides have so many mistakes in the sample calculation, and this made the review extremely time-consuming.",0
"Professor Morse isn't going to fail you because you missed class. With that said, he grades based on what you know and what you can show him. What I love about his teaching method is that it's all about the connections you can find. He always says ""there is no right answer I'm looking for."" He truly wants to be enlightened by your insights.",1
"If you are a good student, try hard, and come prepared you will get a good grade. He is a very caring professor who is willing to give students supplies and great advice. Has a weird sense of humor and wants to show you his way to interpret art. And that is a good thing, don't come in stubborn and wanting to do exactly what you want when you want.",1
"Very Good Prof. I did CSE 1020 with him. His marking is strict, but, he explains clearly everything in the class. Follows the text book  (Java by Abstraction) word by word. Try to read his lecture slides and summary of each chapter in book and ALWAYS do the eChecks, and you should be fine. Overall he is a very good prof.",1
She goes through the slides a million miles an hour. Class is so boring dreaded going to it every time. Taught myself all of the material before the exams. Nice lady and does offer some extra credit. Take home assignments help grade and understanding the material.,0
"WOW! I Never thought I'd be able to take this course from someone who actually WORKED on Wall Street,  especially at UNCP. Fricke made ALL the DIFFERENCE!",1
"Dry course. Naik can't teach! His teaching approach is to write out his notes that he has prepared ahead of time onto the transparent lecture slides. With his notes he is pretty lost, take away the notes and the guy would be stranded.",0
Good professor. Knows a lot about PR. Likes to joke around a lot and tells a lot of cheesy jokes. Great source of information though. Can learn a lot from this professor.,1
"Dr. Arnason is GOD! The God of Thunder to be exact! He actually makes plants really fun! He is hilarious, sometimes I would go to class just to hear his little jokes. He is really easy to understand, just study his notes, and his lecture material, and you'll do great! If u have a question during the exam, ask him, he actually helps you!",1
Terrible teacher don't take Geography just wait till she retires,0
"The best answer for all questions ""I don't know it from the top of my head."" For average student may look like he knows the subject, but he does not. Useless as a teacher, unless you know the subject or what to spend a lot of time self studying. He can use words like Idiots when talking to students, very rude. cannot teach.",0
"Nice lady, but wayyyyyyyyyyyyyy to much work expected. Difficult tests without any kind of curve. Punishing students with heinously low test scores is NOT going to allow them to miraculously slow down time, so as to have enough of it to devote to this class in order to get a good grade.",1
Her course was one of the last of my degree and I was VERY disappointed. Having done higher level courses I Can say her expectations and standards are unreasonable for a 2nd level course. Myself along with others in the course had very negative dealings with her. I was very disappointed with my experience and I would strongly suggest you avoid.,0
"Really good guy, he is kind of spacey. Ex-pot head, Tough grader but really helpful.",1
"Prof. Conley is straightforward & wants you to learn the basic principles of business. She treats you as a professional & wants you to treat the class as though you are already entering a business environment. Do the hw, attend lectures and take good notes-key to passing, youll do great. No excuses do the work, tests & final paper youll pass.",1
GREAT TEACHER ONCE I FIGURED OUT WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT! THE DEPTH OF HIS PHILSOPHY OVERWHELMED ME! GREAT ACTOR OYVEY,1
"I loved this prof!!  He took his time explaining every concept thoroughly. The questions on his midterm were very similar to the assignment questions there are no surprises on the quizzes, midterm or final. If you're good at math attendance is optional, if not his lectures will definitely help you.",1
"Clark is the man. Intellectual rigor does not mean that he's hard ... it just means you have to work hard to earn a good grade.  Plus you should try to read his books ... a compeletely new way of looking at history in general; deep, deep description of British society.",1
"taking the class now. good teacher. arrogant personality. i don't like how she demeans the students but this is why i don't verbally participate or ask questions. the 2 teacher assistance are a good help,respectful. more like a history class than lit. don't talk, no phones, read the books! if you read and take notes,the exams are easy. be on time",1
"Very sweet guy, but I almost died of boredom. On the first day, he told us he repeats himself at least 3 times so that students won't forget the material and he wasn't kidding. Super easy A if you don't mind wading through busy work every week.",0
"Ted is a really cool guy. Extremely opinionated, but if you are able to think for yourself you can appreciate that without letting it rule you. There was a lot of reading, but the majority of the topics were interesting. His classes are NOT for the easily offended or close-minded. Go in with an open mind and you'll enjoy him!",1
"There were discussion boards and chap. tests which were stupid! He'd take one tiny thing from the book and make it a test Q., instead of asking a question about a concept. I didn't like how he structured the tests, but if you have the book w/you, there's no need to read the chap. beforehand 'cuz you can just take the test w/out reading the chap.",0
"Prof Le is good. Really knows his stuff. Clearly a newer professor but overall really good. Took him for MTH123 online and 90% of the grade is based on 4 tests which are open book and not timed, just due at the end of the specified day. Definitely a work at your own pace kind of class. Would highly recommend!",1
he rules,1
"So funny, respects his students. Participation is huge and often very easy to get a good grade on it. One of my favorites.",1
"Personally I did not like Lori Case, she was good for cs 115 but she was not good for cs 116. She is too slow she needs to go at a more faster space. Her explanations weren't really good for cs 116",0
"If you don't understand accounting DO NOT TAKE HIM. You will FAIL. He thinks we should all be accounting majors and when you don't understand it he doesn't help. 4 Quizzes, lowest dropped, and a project. Quizzes  impossible.",0
"I loved him and the class! He is very knowledgable and teaches the subject well too. He tells you exactly what will be on quizes and makes sure you're ready for them. You really can't miss class though, its difficult to catch up and he does take attendance. ",1
Class was out of 1000 points. She gives a lot of extra credit points on exams and quiz's to help boost your grade. She is very nice and willing to help. Some basic physiology concept will get you through the class. Just study off lecture power points and you'll be fine. got an A and did minimal studying. Make sure you study the models though.,1
"He is a nice person. But he is old. His lecture is efficient but boring so you have to force yourself to focus. But if you follow up, you won't regret.",1
"Dr. B is the best professor at Eastern. He is super easy to talk to about classwork or just life in general. He truly cares about his students and wants to see everyone succeed. If you want an A, you'll have to work for it, but it is definitely a good class to take in general.",1
"He's really good, and I was able to follow the formulas really well. I really liked the class! He's an easy going teacher and would have a few laughs in them.",1
"Professor Daly is the best English professor at UB. Period. Going to class isn't a chore at all; instead, his classes feel like story time. He's an engaging professor, a very witty man, and extremely intelligent. If you're an English major and you haven't taken a class with him, you're missing out.",1
"Dr. Finelli is not the guy you want for this online summer class. Sadly, I submitted my review to the University to early. The class is interesting and worthwhile in terms of content but, his directions and Canvas map are all over the place. You must connect the dots in his class or your A will become a C-.",1
"Terrible class. Avoid at all costs.Very knowledgeable, but this class is WAY too much work and the tests are WAY too difficult for an introductory class. He doesn't give you a study guide, and his wife is at every class period. She is very rude and useless. Avoid this class",0
"I would avoid taking a class from Tim at all costs.  While he is a nice guy who really knows his stuff, he is also quite loony (he calls his wife ""mother"") and he treated our class like we were all in special ed.  Test questions come completely out of nowhere, and i learned far more from the book than from the class.  Way too much work for nothing.",0
"Joe is an awesome professor!! I loved the way he taught his class and learned so much!! If you get a chance to take interpersonal comm with him, do it!! You will love it!!!",1
"She assigns work daily to turn in the next class. She does not accept late work, nor does she grade on time. If you want to go the semester not knowing your grade by her or BB she's the one. This is a SELF LEARN COURSE!!!!! Only took the class because it was substitution for Stats II. Should have took my chances with Stats.",0
"Palkovitz is such an awesome professor! He incorporates a lot of stories about his life and adventures into his lectures and really wants his students to do well. The homework is online, doesn't take too long, and you do them about 2-3 times a week. Exams are tough but the only written assignment is an easy A. He tries to be funny, it's appreciated",1
"One of the funniest professors and best lecturers I have ever had.  He is definitely difficult, but he's easily approachable and willing to work with you, so don't be discouraged from taking his classes.",1
Scared of technology. Wages war against the environment. Wants to make sure the Earth will become uninhabitable for all future generations. Requires assignments to be typed but also requires them to be printed TWICE and turned in physically. Bragged about the massive size of a stack of papers a student had at the end of the semester for her class.,0
Mrs Kuntzman is a great teacher! I took her class as my 2nd attempt at math 043 becaus I had failed the semster before. I was having to retake the class and very discouraged but I have recieved an A on every assignment. She took me from hating Math to being an A+ student. She's amazing! I Highly recomend her!,1
"Good guy. Good lecturer. Just print his notes, add to them during the lecture and you're fine.",1
"This class requires A LOT of work. Everything bad you've read about him on this site is true. LOTS of homework on Mastering Physics. Does give ""study guides"" for tests, gives EC for attendance but overall WORST teacher at GRCC. Did not learn a single thing. Sad that my last credit at CC had to be so awful. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.",0
"Fr. Ranieri is a very intelligent man. His class was very intimidating at first for me, mainly because I am not an honors student and was unsure what to expect. Do the readings, attend class, and participate. Ended up with a B+.",1
"Loved this class! He is very very helpful with every paper you write and you can come to him with any question and he will be glad to answer it! I never got an A on a paper and I feel like his grading on papers might be a little strict, but overall he is great! Would recommend him to anybody.",1
"Professor Morosoff is a sweet teacher, but if you talk about things she does not like, she will give you a low grade for your assignments. So just make sure your essay or discussions are what she wants to hear to get a good grade. I feel it is very unprofessional that a teacher can grade things by what she likes or wants, so beware.",0
"He absolutely rocks. He's fun, affectionate and knowledgable. He keeps the subject interesting and gotta say he hates cheating!!!",1
"Online MGT 258 was extremely easy. Reading is required, but it is entertaining reading. 3 quizzes per week (easy, but time-consuming), 3 assignments per week, 1 Book reading and paper, and 2 exams. Very easy A with all the extra credit as well.",1
A high-school level course.,0
"She is really amazing, helpful, and approachable if u don't mess around!!!!( slacking off, or thinking you know alot and your class is too easy- then you are in trouble!)",1
"Tests are hard. Multiple choice answers are tricky. The essays questions will cover both lecture and reading. Tons of extra credit, do not expect it to raise your total grade. The professor was really nice at first. Towards the end, he would randomly pick on students during class. Warning he may offend some students with sterotypes.",0
This is the most difficult course i've taken at Seneca as a CPA student. You had to read complex concepts to pass the midterm. The content material is extremely difficult. The professor's delivery of difficult course concepts was poor. DBS301 was MUCH easier. I recommend to only take this course if your dream is to be a database administrator.,0
I have had Ann 4courses in prev. yrs & she was great. But this year it seems she has too much on her plate. SO UNORGANIZED. Grades before midterm released week of the final. Never sticks on schedule & has no time return student msgs unless you track her down in person-Then she is very helpful. I think she is just ready to retire.,0
She does not communicate well over email or canvas so you must try to speak with her in person. During hurricane Irma she would not answer emails and would only state please see the announcements. There is no compassion in the grading of missed assignments in her classes even if confronted with proof of being impacted by a natural disaster.,0
"I took this class for a humanities credit .Do not do that. I struggled to stay awake and found the material very boring. If you're into philosophy, maybe you'll feel differently, but I dreaded this class. Dr. Vielkind is a very nice man who definitely wants you to be interested in philosophy, but it's just not for everybody",0
"He's nice and funny, but he needs to have a better assignment submission system. I'm not the best test-taker and the only thing in the gradebook are our exams. I don't understand his lectures, he doesn't make much sense. We need more practice work :/ I'm interested in majoring in Computer Science but this class makes me feel like I shouldn't.",0
"She does not teach. She rambles on about irrelevant topics and really does not enjoy being there in class. She basically just wants to get through the material and receive her paycheck. If you want to learn accounting, take someone else. You are stuck fending for yourself in this class, and it is not enjoyable. Easy due to ex cred, but not helpful.",0
"This is a difficult class, but it is doable. You just need to read, pay attention, take notes, and study. Dr. Hollis loves his subject, and that makes it easier to learn. There are enough grades in the class to help your grade. He gives great feedback on tests, and you will have lecture and lab quizzes.",1
"Why is she apologizing for everything? Why are the assignments (which take a LOT of time) only worth 10% of your grade? Why do her lectures make me wanna fall asleep in seconds? These are all questions you may ask yourself when you go to her class. (Also don't mess with her cmd while she's teaching, she will NOT be happy LMAO)",0
"If you have the right mindset for real math (and most engineers seem not to), his classes are a breeze, and you will probably learn the material for personal interest anyway. He is super lenient about grades in upper-level classes. But in the required classes, tread carefully. Tests are truly straightforward but (many) people fail anyway.",1
"I really wish I had experienced the joy of being a student of Prof. Bailey before my final semester at Guelph. So willing to help, makes boring subject matter interesting, and is funny in lecture. Definitely one of, if not the best, professor in the philosophy department. Do yourself a favour and take a class of his!",1
Worst professor I have taken in 3 years at this university. His operating systems class uses an in development language called Rust with a buggy compiler and no real world application. His assignments deal with web servers and shells and emphasize learning this language rather than operating systems.,0
"This professor has a problem with mumbling in class. Sit towards the front. Though it is not mandatory, do NOT miss class. He shows a lot of irrelevant video clips, often taking ""hard evidence"" from comedy central's stand up comedians, and then uses them on the test. His lectures are dry, and points will only be from tests, no other homework.",0
"Microeconomics. Paid approximately $40 for his homework program. Generously curves the first 2 exams. NOT the final. Homework is very simple. Exams are essentially homework questions so truly understand the homework. Sign-in sheet is passed around but once you sign, you can go w/o any consequences. Book is NECESSARY. Cheap. approx $10",1
"Portocarrero is, simply put, the bomb. She creates an environment that is fun yet still informative, and is always willing to clarify and adjust to your needs. She does expect effort though, so don't slack off. ",1
"Professor Gross was a very good teacher. Although I received a C+, the class average was a B+ (probably because I didn't read the book and didn't always show up). She made the class interesting and there were a few opportunities for extra credit, which helped me a lot. Read the book and go to class and you'll have a good grade.",1
"Simply put, he's one of the best. His expectations very clear, and his test are fair. He is knowledgable and extremely down to earth!",1
"Worst professor I've ever had. Can't understand him and class isn't worth going to, except for the fact that you're graded on it. Avoid avoid avoid.",0
"Rodgers was rarely teaching us something we actually needed to know for our homework and test.  I haven't learned anything from him, I've pretty much had to teach myself.  He takes about 3 weeks to reply to an email, if you ask in person you will stand there listening for 10min and at the end you'd be more confused than before.",0
"Lectures are boring. I tried really hard not to fall asleep because Professor speaks in monotone. Powerpoint slides are repetitive. Lecture guides are not organized because sometimes the ones she put up on smartsite are different from the ones in class. For me, the concepts are difficult to understand. But the books are somewhat interesting. Overal",0
"Dr. Tops has taken over EGRE 206 and its an improvement from previous professors. Hes very interesting, you wont be bored. But time can be spent more so going over concepts than doing practice problems when in a class like this practice problems help the most. TAs can grade harsh and somewhat unfair, but will give points back. Good class overall",1
"Best prof ever! Failed PSY120 last semester so I decided to retake it with him. His lectures are amazing and does such a good job at explaining the material. The second exam is known to have a class avg of a F so beware. If you attend lectures and study the chapter quizzes in the book, the other exams should be easy. He has a great sense of humor!",1
"No point in attending his class. All the powerpoints are word from word from the book. He just rambles with no point to what he is saying.If you are interested in Psych, I don't suggest him, his teaching will kill your desire.",0
"Nice guy, marks very hard from a rulebrick (no part marks). Midterm was very difficult and requires assignment knowledge beforehand even though it was due a week after.",0
"Really weird guy. But pretty easy class, essay every two weeks, no need to read or even buy the books, you'll never use them. Extra credit quizes to help make up for bad papers, study for them .. they help. Up to 400 pts of EC!",1
"She's organized and gives a lot of work.  She's caring, but tough.",1
"It blows my mind he has a good rating on here. I honestly believe he is the worst professor ive ever had. I respect the ""learn on your own technique"" but he refuses to answer any questions and will tell you to look it up. why am i paying for the class if i have to google everything? Its like he's trying to make the class harder.",0
"he SUCK, nothing on the test that he is discusing in class.  he teach NOTHING in class, he only talk about JUNK, and boring.....",0
She is a very picky grader and does not care if English is not your first language. She does not emphasize what she wants on the assignments specifically and really cannot take criticism back when you tell her to explain things. Maybe she is bad online because she has such high ratings here. I suggest taking her in person rather than online.,0
"very awesome professor.  she is always willing to help and understands what things are like in college, unlike a lot of other professors.",1
"Within the field of International Relations, Professor Contantelos is hands down the most qualified professor at Grand Valley. He is extremely intellectual. Classes are mandatory, but he gives 2 free absences. The schedule is very structured, with three books and a relatively large research project. Take him, he will make you smarter.",1
"TrÃ¨s long et plate, en plus de Ã§a il n'est pas claire!",0
"Dr. Peck is so genuine. He truly cares about each and every one of his students success and well-being. Hes a geeky sort of funny and he keeps lectures interesting. The tests arent too difficult as long as you study, and the study guides are really helpful. He provides a lot of extra credit opportunities too. Love this guy.",1
Jeff is the legend in computer science theory and a very caring prof. He would always be open for questions during a lecture so you can interrupt him if you don't understand something and he would explain stuff clearly. Computer science math courses are very challenging but luckily he's very generous with grades and gives you lots of time to think.,1
"It was a challenging class, lots of material to remember. Practice midterm and final are not very helpful. The tests are harder, questions are tricky with 5 options to pick from and I think that was unnecessary. All answer choices are very similar to each other so that makes the tests even harder.",0
"I took this class my freshman year in order to complete a GUR. I showed up to class about 80% of the time. No textbook. Hud was kind/ flexible as long as you communicate. Without his lectures, you'll fail. If you go and take thorough notes, you'll do great. He gives you the test questions; if you can write word-for-word what he says in class: A!",1
"I didn't really enjoy the ""old school"" format of the class with lessons on the whiteboard and all. I would have probably liked opre 3360 more. However, this class is super easy and if you show up and take good notes you will definitely get a good grade. He's also super helpful in office hours so meet up with him whenever you have questions.",1
"When you do a writing assignment, she give very good feedback. She will always help you. If you show up and do her assignment you will pass the class",1
Quizzes every week so be sure to study for them. There is a written portion and a multiple choice portion for tests. I recommend writing your notes out in order to help with the written portion. Pay attention in class and write down what he says. He does give partial credit on exams/quizzes. If you get something wrong hell write out the answer,1
"I don't know how you can even call this guy a professor, he doesn't teach anything. His only contribution to the class was the syllabus/schedule, and exam questions. Graders grade assignments. Tests are based purely from textbook reading/memorization. He clearly states that if you have questions DO NOT contact him, contact the grader.",0
Avoid at all costs. He pretends to want to help you and then destroys all your ideas because he doesn't understand them. Lectures are extremely boring and participation is worth 15%,0
Professor Lang is a great  professor. He is funny and very entertaining but also knows his stuff. His stories and jokes make the class super interesting. Tests are easy and there is just no way you can fail this class. He gives opportunities for extra credit and is very flexible with assignments. Definitely recommend him!!!,1
Awful! If youre a visual learner this class will be extremely difficult. She uses launchpad & reef & theyre extremely expensive. If you dont buy them youll obviously wont pass! Her study guides are useless & she had no set office hours & its very hard to reach her. Do yourself a favor & dont take her,0
He is an nice man but not a very talented in the teaching department.I learned very quickly just to read out of the book and to show up for Friday quizzes.that's right he does a quiz every Friday and they don't help on the test. All in all you are stuck taking him for organic because oc only offers him.,0
"Dr. Roberts class was fairly easy, and she often gave extra credit. I enjoyed her lectures and learned a lot",1
"Monotone, soft spoken and writes very small on the board, so sit at the front. Expect to take a LOT of notes during each class session. Homework is assigned, isn't collected, but do it because potential exam questions resemble homework problems. No calculator allowed on midterms. 3 midterms, 1 final. Every exam is 25%. Take him if you are EE major!",1
"Marvyn is great, he really cares about his students success and will go above and beyond to help you. I thought I hated math until I took his course! He tries his best to relate concepts to everyday life which really helps.",1
"Fantastic professor. VERY hard class but you will learn a ton. He is a funny guy who loves the Lord, knows what he is talking about, and is extremely helpful if approached outside of class. One of the most intelligent people I have ever met.",1
"Take PSY 101 with this professor and you will have nap time twice a week. He is monotone and just shows videos. When it comes to the tests, the questions are formatted poorly and just leave you confused. The material is dry, and seems outdated. Many things could be improved on.",0
"Very liberal professor, which I guess is expected from a sociology professor but with him it is blatant. In lectures, all he does is rant about how terrible capitalism is and of he isnt doing that he is talking about himself. If you want to do well on exams then read the book because he isnt very good at teaching.",0
"Dr. Rogers is caring and helpful! Her lecture is amazing, try to attend every lecture you will get 5%. Try to take her course, and you wont regret your decision! Sometimes there will be some problems about grade calculations. Dont hesitate, come to her office hours and tell her your situation! Miracles will happen!",1
"She's funny, and a great person, but her lectures are pretty disorganized and it takes her a long time to get things back to you.",0
"Skerpan-Wheeler is by far the WORST professor I've had at TXST.  She always goes on tangents when she lectures and gives direction only in class when it comes to assignments. She says she'll put directions on TRACS but what she uploads is basically a word document saying ""follow instructions given in class."" I wish I was warned before I took her.",0
I took the English 100 online course for high school students in the winter semester. I highly recommend Melanie for any other students thinking about participating in the accelerated program. She's very clear; you will always know what is expected of you. She is one of the few professors that actually want to teach first years. Highly recommend!,1
"Stay away from this guy if you can. He is terrible teacher, he is sloppy all over the place. Take with someone else, don't wast your time. ",0
"DO NOT take this professor.  She sucks at teaching, she don't know how to communicate with her students.  She's constantly rude she surely do not help you at all.",0
"Not what I expected in a Children's Literature class. The work assigned was not hard just too much. It was hard to follow her syllabus as it was not updated to the textbook required for the class. This professor was the worst at grading, and forget about getting a response back if you had any questions. I do not recommend taking her class online.",0
"Very much loves his personality, and loves attention. Talks about him more than the actual class. Does not have much experience, and does not have many examples for the class. Give tests, but leaves the room. Intentional late. No care for the students unless they are female. Grabs women in front of all the class, and has not a good reputation......",0
"bruh, this lady is a nut case.  Hardest tests and quizzes I've ever taken and you have to go to 2 jazz performances.  aint no body got time for that.. Biggest curve at the end so you'll get a good grade.. do not take... trust me..",0
"Professor Seraphin is a nice guy, but not a great professor. The whole UD Math department is TRASH, and this class is no different. They do not take responsibility for anything. Our 2nd test most of the class failed, but somehow it was our fault that everyone did so poorly. There is stuff on the tests that aren't even covered in lecture. DONT TAKE!",0
Very genuine/caring and is very knowledgeable in the subject. However is very scatterbrained and mostly rambles on making class very boring. The TA's give you the answers to the tests beforehand. You pretty much learn the same topics covered in HWST 107. Extremely boring but really easy if you have basic knowledge of hawaiian history.,0
"Enrolled in this class with much optimism and interest. Ended up being quite disappointed in the quality of instruction. Peers in the class were immensely helpful; the prof, not at all. I got the impression that she was overworked and didn't have the time to carefully read and consider our writing.",0
"This prof is terrible. He is the most horrible prof I have never ever seen before in the school. All he can do in the class is to only read PPT. Everyone can be a prof if only reads PPT. Also, he hates to answer your question. I take his morning class everyday but leart nothing. Do not take his class unless you want to fail this course.",0
"Some of the assignments were a little ambiguous, but she provides great feedback to help you understand where you may have gone wrong. ",1
"Dr. McCabe is both feared and respected. He is by far the toughest instructor I have had; but I learn so much from him with each course. I failed my ""Revelation"" course with him but I still found the experience worth while and I hope to retake the course. I took his N.T. Theology course and yes it was challenging but did I learn anything? Oh YEAH!",1
"Absent minded, easy grader, no communication, confusing requests, not organized",0
"If you think this is a blow off class think again! He is a very smart professor, but He does ask far to much from his students, especially since their only experience thus far was an intro class. Pay attention or prepare to be constantly depressed.",0
"All throughout the semester the class I thought was going fine until halfway through the semester no grades were posted trying to get ahold of him was impossible. If you wanted to know your grade you had to ask wasn't readily available, just a total disaster.",0
"Took his class for 131 & barely passed. Idk why I decided to take him for college Algebra ,its useless because he teaches you his way and expects you to know all the formulas already. He makes fun of the students and rants in class instead of doing lectures. He gives very few test thats why I took his class but he doesnt curve grades. Hes awful!",0
Professor Stone seemed to almost check out from teaching halfway through the semester. She hands you worksheets on new concepts and will not give much information as to what to do. She is extremely vague when you ask for help. Good luck to anyone who gets stuck in this class.,0
"Hands down, the worst professor I've ever taken at JMU. ""Lectures"" are all over the place, and he just puts a bunch of random words in a word document and rambles on. Before the quizzes, you have to read all the scenarios in a book, and he asks 12 T or F questions that are impossible to remember in the reading because the reading is like 100 pages.",0
One of my favorite professors this year. He keeps lectures interesting and knows what he's talking about. If you are lost on any of the homework problems he's always willing to help.,1
She is the worst prof ever,0
"He is such an awesome professor. He really cares for all of his students. He not only teaches you spanish, he teaches you about life in general.  I learned so much in his class. He assigns a lot of homework but that is the only way to learn the language.",1
"This is my first review on this site. The professor was THAT awful. Take my word for it and DO NOT take this professor. If you are thinking of dropping his class DO IT NOW, I regret not doing it. He's awful at teaching to be frank. He does not explain the topics well. He will write out answers without showing steps or explaining the foundation.",0
"MTE 1 - 4 I'm slow with math &  hate it but she made it easy for me to learn. Not recommended if you already know your stuff. She will baby step & make sure everyone understands. Book not needed, MTE code is cheaper. hw is posted ahead of time. Gives extra credit. Weekly tests. Don't miss class or be late. Creates foundation needed for math",1
"High quality of instruction; really tough grading. Getting an A requires having unparalleled time commitment and dedication to the course, as well as raw ability and luck. Best recommendation is for students very interested in the subject to go ahead and take her. Those filling requirements should avoid. Strong effort alone does NOT guarantee an A.",1
This lady is NUTS! Avoid taking this course with her if you can! Take my advice please! You will be better off taking this course with somebody else!,0
"Dr. Dewald is an excellent professor. His readings and discussions are more thought-provoking than in any college course I have ever taken before. You will always leave class with your mind spinning, and educated convictions on the topics. I definitely recommend this course to anyone looking for a mentally stimulating and fun course.",1
Half the time you are there you won't know what he is talking about. Stick to the book. You have to go to class for the iclicker points though. Sometimes he is funny. The TA's are your best friends for this class. Get to know them check blackboard and your e-mail frequently. There are curves on almost everything. tb not used in class but at home.,0
"Excellent professor. The best I've had at the University of Ottawa. He teaches hard classes but, because he is very knowledgeable and because he has an easiness for transmitting the material, he is quite effective. Congratulations and keep it up!",1
Higurashi Sensei only cares about the students who are already good at Japanese and not the ones who are actually learning it from the start. Native Japanese speakers who learned from their parents or students who are good at it without studying a lot are loved and respected. Anyone else she doesn't care. That's not what being a teacher is about.,0
"I enjoyed the course content, however he was not a good professor. Things that would be somewhat interesting would put you to sleep after he was done talking about it. Aside from that, he can't hear a thing. Retire this man and put him in a nursing home before other students are forced to suffer thru this course with this man!!!!",0
"She started off very good and then after the first few weeks, it seemed like she did not care as much. Felt like she would pick certain people out and grade them a lot more tough than others.",0
great dude but more work than you expect. easy to get an A if you try a little,1
"Class meetings are pointless. Tests are based 100% on the text and online lectures he posts, yet we don't discuss the material in class at ALL. Doesn't make things very clear, goes from one subject to another very rapidly without transition. Dropped his class and got another professor!",0
"If you have to take him, then do so but know that it will be a long semester. Although he has no control over masteringchemistry, the dates are back to back to do homework and more often than not, he does not even realize what he is doing. If you do not like chemistry, do not take him. He doesn't seem enthaustic about teaching and is not a people.",0
"Shes a nice person but her lectures are very boring and kind of hard to follow along. Her examples she gives and whats on tests and quizzes dont match up. If you dont already have a good basic understanding of chem and the math thats used, then take someone else.",0
He is a funny character and has a different sense of humor. He does fly through his Power Points and it's HARD to take notes. Be prepared for sarcasm if you ask a question. It could've been a fun class had it been taught differently but it just wasn't.,0
"Avoid this professor at all cost. Hansen is very out of touch with the real world but still tries to provide life lessons. As an older student, I found him very disrespectful. The only class that has made me feel like I was in high school and being lectured at not taught.",0
"The professor is the worse professor I have ever met. There's pretty much zero practical explanation of the material in class, and exams are ridiculously difficult- it's as if your expected to memorize every little tax rule and condition, as writing everything down on a cheat sheet using the textbook takes far too long.",0
"To put it simply, broke my love for painting.",0
Funniest teacher I've ever had.,1
"Decent Prof.  Not the best I've had- like others have said, he is always very fantic and disorganized- but he did seem like a nice guy, and when he did start his leactures, they were pretty good.",1
He is a terrible professor. Extremely difficult to understand his lectures in addition to his assignments. On top of that he is rude and condescending with remarks he makes to questions. I dropped his class and am re-taking with another professor now who makes the class so much easier.,0
We don't know 1/2 of our grades and never hands back assignments!  Last exam covered calculations and material we didn't even get taught how to do! How am I supposed to fill in a chart of calculations when we were not taught how to do them in class?  He is a joke and so disorganized.  Do not take this prof--run away--it is a semester of nightmares,0
"Farming class is a joke. Save yourself and don't take his class, take someone else!",0
"WORST TEACHER EVER! Seriously. I could not understand a word he was saying. He told us to study one thing, then didn't put it on tests. He even put some stuff on the tests that he didn't go over! In fact, he told us not to study one thing, and then put it on the test! I do not recommend this teacher to ANYONE! Stay far away from this teacher.",0
I honestly have been to 1 zoom since we moved all online and I still have an A. Pretty easy and there's only a few quizzes and tests but you do have to a workout log and wellness passport but they're not bad. Easy A if you barely even try.,0
"Say good bye to your GPA when the exams roll around. Hardest marking I've ever seen in all my years. WAY TO MUCH MATERIAL IN THIS COURSE. He even admits this on the first day. It's a giant unorganized mess, and you'll be struggling to keep up with this guy.",0
"Do not take his class online, especialy if you don't do well in timed quizzes. Victor doesn't care about your circumstances! People celebrated because he gave us an extra five minutes on the final for a forty minute forty question test. The curriculum just screamed lazy and disappointment",0
"Loved this professor, very nice, helpful and grades fair. Would reccomend him.",1
"She is the worst professor at the university. In a class about why one ought not to make sweeping generalizations about groups of people, she found it very necessary to do so with regard to her class. She insulted the prior education and viewpoints of the class on a daily basis. She is a hypocrite and a know it all, who doesn't actually know jack.",0
"As much as this class can be difficult, it prepares you really well for A&P. Things move really fast so make sure you have the extra time in your schedule to study. Alison recommends at least 10 extras hours a week.",1
This professor taught us nothing. We were left hopeless and confused for the final exam. His quizzes and exams were completely unfair and so was his grading. He was rude and unhelpful. I wish I went and complained to someone about him because his class was really unfair.,0
"god this lady is the devil, simon cowel of the speech word. everything you do is wrong, even if its right. NEVER take this lady.",0
really good teacher. Easy to understand.,1
"WORST TEACHER AT NASHVILLE STATE! Doesn't enter grades at all, claims he only gives a final grade and you are suppose to keep up with your own grades to know if your're passing. Takes the fun out of art! Does the same thing every single class!!! He talks with terrible language and bad body language and uses profanity, which is so unnecessary!",0
She's hot!,1
Great Professor! Anyone taking ANT 204 this is the professor you want! He is really nice and keeps the lectures interesting. He is a fair grader so you do not have to worry about your GPA in this course. I learned a lot from him and it was just a fun course overall. Online midterm that you do at home and take-home final exam essays.,1
She's an ok prof but doesn't give great concrete examples at times. It's also extremely hard to pay attention in her class.,1
He is not only handsome and fit but also a fantastic person and a knowledgeable proffessor.  I've never been so comfortable with a teacher that knows so much about all the mucky mucks.,1
"Instructor was inaccessible all semester, checked in once a week in a 6 week course, which led to a lot of assignments with no submit links, or being posted the day before they were due. Assignments are convoluted busy work, that she grades harshly for something she isn't available for questions about. Students had to answer each others ? instead.",0
Great teacher!  Math is very hard for me but Mr. Rouse is an awesome teacher and helps his students! Take for a helpful teacher. He will stay or arrive early to help you out.,1
"WORST TEACHER BY FAR, HELLA CONTRIDICTIONS. picks on students unmercifully. grades on a ""what I say goes basis"" meaning if you have a similar ALSO CORRECT answer he will not count it . gives quizzes with no clarity on content  or chapter randomly. ""the quizzes can be on anything we've covered during the semester"" -Cage and he doesn't tell you what",0
"Very energetic, knowledgeable and funny professor. Sooo cultured, dresses wonderfully and looks like a model. Easy to talk to -definitely my favorite professor at UP!",1
Worst professor I have ever had!,0
"She really grew on me. the first time i had her i thought she was okay, but the second time i found her very informative. when she is talking about subject matter she really knows she is very clear, organized, and even funny. Its easy to follow along and the readings are usually good. the tests seem daunting but she is a pretty generous grader.",1
"The class was harder than expected, but his lectures were always interesting. He is funny.",1
"I took him during the online semester, reading his reviews for in person instruction seem much better than online! We were not allowed a cheat sheet on exams. His lectures were the worst I have ever attended. He goes over simple example during lectures and gave homework that is much harder. Avoid him at any cost.",0
"If the exams weren't take home then I wouldn't have passed. The questions are difficult and all short answer. Thank goodness for COVID. If you have to take this class in person and the exam isn't a take home. Do not take it, it isn't worth the trouble",0
I love this man with all my heart,1
"McDowell's exams are crazy difficult. I copy and answer the study guide questions for every exam and cannot make above a 70. His lectures can be interesting at times, but even when you listen and take notes you'll struggle. If you have to take this class, good luck.",0
I had Mr. Colley as a professor in Plymouth State University and he was amazing. He only stayed for...one year i think as the town was too small and not a lot going on arts wise as far as a place to LIVE went. We were sad to see him go. I fell in love with printmaking  in his Intaglio class!!!,1
Dr. Borg is hilarious ands lectures are interesting if you pay attention. Go to his office hours for help on the papers and tests. All around great guy and would definitely recommend him.,1
he singles people out and talks mainly to the females in the class. do not take him,0
"Mark Fernandes is a horrible teacher, wont help anyone during any Practical Tests or anything. Tells you a little clue and walks away when you have a problem and puts no effort into trying to help his students.",0
I feel sorry for anyone taking him in the winter semester because the fall semester is literaly half fantasy football league.  You won't learn anything and they clearly just need someone to teach this for a theme.  You can't get a bad grade but for some reason he wont let everyone get A's. A way for GV to take money from you and waste some time.,0
"She's an odd but actually very good teacher with good experience.  And BTW, she left her last job because she married Fred.  And Fred was in Maryville. Duh.  Someone below can't grasp the obvious.",1
I had a great class experience. Dr. Kelley is an excellent professor as well as super understanding and accommodating to students. I gained a lot more knowledge than I expected. I highly recommend Dr. Kelley's class.,1
Very good teacher. Knowledgeable and willing to help with any questions.,1
This class if full of daily lectures and constant homework assignments. Dr. Steadman is a cool guy but not super flexible on deadlines and outside circumstances. If you pay attention in class and do your work it is an easy A.,1
"If you like stretching, this is the class for you. We spent almost an hour every class stretching and warming up and about 20 minutes dancing. I was in a Jazz I/II split and Jazz II hardly had time to learn anything new. She?s a wonderful person and a lot of fun, but really nit-picky on just about everything. Be wary of taking her!",1
"She was probably the worst professor I've had to deal with. She is an extremely tough grader, when she gets around to grading. Her instructions are extremely unclear and she doesn't tell you due dates. You can't keep to the syllabus since it changed the first day. She was unwilling to answer questions and her questions are extremely open ended.",0
Wonderful class. I always looked forward to his lectures. Everything was pretty straight-forward and I loved the stories he would tell during lecture. Definitely would recommend.,1
"Associate Professor, Senior Associate Chair Ha Ha Learn to get your self out of a paper bag Ha Ha",0
"The material on the exams are not based on understanding, but on stupid memorization.  He also injects his political and religious views into a chemistry class--no small feat.  He is extremely arrogant.",0
Hardest proffesor that I have ever encountered. Gives a lot of pop quizzes that are mainly on the seperate readings he assigns. If you mess up a little bit he marks it wrong. Would not reccomend taking his class.,0
"Professor Nuchereno gives great lectures that are heavily attended by her students even though she didn't make attendance mandatory this past semester. She gives 4 exams including the final, and you can drop your lowest score. Taking good notes on her lectures and doing the online quizzes and homework will lead you to do very well in her class.",1
"He's definitely an awesome Professor! He's always ready to help, both in and outside class. His class is super organized and the grading criteria is very clear. Go to class because his lectures are useful. Use homework solutions he printed out to review for exams.",1
"over 75% of the class failed the midterm, so our final grades were based on our final exam.",0
An easy A if you have coding experience but dont expect to learn a lot from her. Class covers little. Old school teaching methods that are far from efficient. She tests you on picky details instead of how well you can code in R. Take with someone else if you can. Shes really nice and caring but I wont take a class with her again.,0
"this guy RULES, so all you negative ppl can kiss AZZ!",1
"So far this semester he has been an amazing teacher; He is a bit hard to catch during his office hours, but if you can catch him at the right time he can answer all your questions you may have. He is a very smart individual hands down.",1
"Dr. Draper's Environmental Policy, Law, and Society class is great. She is well versed in her profession; she delivers clear and concise lectures, and she uses real-world examples. Even with all her credentials (Ph.D., J.D.) she is very much in touch with her students. She genuinely wants her students to succeed in and out of the classroom.",1
"really great...fun class...she seems ez but ther's alot of work..if u do it, she's good about the grades tho...make sure you show up, talk and do allthe writing...very good",1
Mark's a good guy but can be a little monotone. If you have a good class his sense of humor will show. The guy loves stats and definately knows what he's talking about. There was 2 tests a few homeworks and a final paper.,1
"I thought he was awful, he didnt explain anything well and if you didnt understand it he wasn't willing to help.",0
The crazy thing is that it really is not a hard class yet Victor makes it that way due to the way he set this class up. 10 MIN time limit on quizzes? How can a class have lecture hours from 1230-145 yet you only have 10 min to take a quiz thats based off of 3+ hours of lectures. I dont even think Victor knows what he is doing himself. Dont take,0
Horrible woman. Miserable and has no respect for her students in the slightest bit. She is genuinely belittling and has no problem embarrassing you in front of classmates. She grades very harshly and offers absolutely no help to improve your grade (which she does not tell you unless you badger her for it).,0
"Tries hard but is very confusing. He has the weirdest sayings âwhen doing calculus you must stick your head out like a giraffe reaching for foodâ! ""now let's ask ourselves"" is said at least 10 times a class and can drive you insane. Overall,no point in waking up at 7 to go to his lectures.",0
Very clear presentation and excellent one on one skills.,1
He's Chinese and has a heavy accent. He is very hard to understand and is bad at explaining things. He words everything weird. He should not be allowed to teach an advanced class like biochem. Do not listen to the positive reviews. The only good thing about him is you can get points from hw and he gives 5% worth of extra credit.,0
"She is SOO nice and really cares abt her students and wants them to do well. But she is pretty disorganized, and vocab quizzes are just rough, no matter how much you study. I imagine she'd have been easier to follow if it hadn't been 8am.",1
"Had her many years ago. Sounds like not a lot has changed with her. She is sarcastic, snooty, & borderline disrespectful to students. Any question is a dumb question. Always expect to be there 5-10 late. In my humble opinion the worst professor in the psychology department. She lost my midterm assignment and tried to tell me I never turned it in.",0
"Very nice man, but explains poorly, and makes errors in his examples.",1
Chef is really good keeps everybody on the same page so we can prepare for the industry thanks for keeping us in line chef,1
Really hard to understand him and expect you to learn everything on your own. Do not recommend this professor.,0
"His lectures are confusing- he is really nice and passionate about the subject, but he is terrible at specifying what is important and what you need to take away with each point. he rushes over examples that would be helpful and his slides are so unorganized, you leave lecture confused not knowing what the take away was supposed to be.",0
Dr. Maril is my favorite prof I've ever had. He gives you the facts to base your own opinions on social problems without giving his own beliefs. The readings are on the test so if you slack off on reading your grade will drop. He does not use powerpoints or BB so you have to go to class to take notes on lectures to study for the exams.,1
"When I first took cell bio with her, it was tough. After finishing A&P, I think she's one of the best teachers. She teaches what you need to know, and really makes you work to understand it, which is essential! She's also always there to clarifyanswer anything you need!",1
"Cheryl is outstanding. I hate that she uses tests in her journalism classes, but her editing skills and experience is invaluable. After taking her Feature Writing and Advanced News and Reporting classes, my journalism skills have improved ten-fold. Highly recommend, but be ready to work. Her classroom is ran as tight of a ship as a newsroom.",1
"Pretty straight forward class, Prof. Edwards is knowledgeable and tries to make sure everyone understands the material. There's online homework almost every week that can be tough. There's an exam every 3-4 chapters and it's 6-7 problems; they're just like the stuff you do in class so if you pay attention, you should be able to do it no problem.",1
Hes was a great teacher!! He helps everyone with wutever they need! Hes also a cool person to talk to!!,1
"Watch for mechanical errors on your case study.  He is my favorite professor.  I leanred a lot in his class and his tests were easy, so long as you keep up with notes and the text.  The case study was easy too, just make sure you do not procrastinate.",1
"As others have said, this woman is stuck in the past. Very dry lectures straight out of the textbook, limited class discussion, no discussion of current events and does not use Brightspace or any visual aid. It really seems like she stopped caring.",0
"Don't take her. Anatomy is a hard class already. You don't need to be burdened by a teacher who doesn't know anything about what she is teaching. If you ask her questions about the material, she will tell you to ""Google it"" (Even if it is on material she just went over). Also watch your grades as she won't give you all of yours.",0
Watkins is a genuine professor who cares highly about his students. He has traveled the world and has the most amazing stories. I would take another class with him in a heartbeat. He likes to engage in discussions which makes learning more interesting.,1
One of the best professors ever! Brent is probably the most hilarious professor ever. He makes mineralogy do-able and fun. Strongly recommended.,1
"I think she's the worst teacher at the J School for first-year students. I know she has good reviews for her upper-level courses, but it didn't go well when I had her for a 100-level class. She expects you to know things you haven't been taught yet. Her tests are also pretty difficult because she focuses on very obscure sections of the textbook.",0
"We spent 13 weeks reading about Cystic Fibrosis and the papers that went into it, barely learned about genetics itself.Her tests are very unclear, are not representative of what was done in class, and the homework can't be done with just lecture knowledge. Feedback on tests were simple ""no"",""good"", or ""ok"". I learned more from LA's. Don't take her.",0
"Dr. Nguyen was my favorite professor I've ever had! He's really the only professor in philosophy who made me read the texts, which is pretty rare in the philosophy department. He will make you work hard, but in the end, you'll know so much more than when you first walked into his class. If you truly want to learn philosophy, he's the one for you.",1
"Ayland was a great Strength training teacher! The in class days are mostly group discussion about hot topics in the health world, with a few days of boring lecture. Overall a very fun class that I learned a lot it! Quiz once a week that everyone should pass. Honestly the book for this class is not needed though.",1
Annoying and hard to listen to. For the love of god say the word verBs. Its not verVs. Her class was a mistake to take. Expects you to have gotten 100% in Spanish 12 when you're not even allowed to take it with span 12. Makes stupid jokes that aren't funny. Mainly talks about how much she loves random celebrities and how old she is,0
Hard but willing to talk.  Does appear to need validation from others regarding her own views.,1
"SCOM123 was one of the hardest classes I've had this semester, and it's clear that most scom classes aren't hard at all. Dr. Barnes is a very tough grader and her teaching style is very confusing. If you're considering taking her online- DON'T. I'm not sure how she is in person, but being in her online class sucked. SCOM should not be this hard.",0
I tried very hard in this class all semester and was still receiving poor grades. The rubrics are hard to find on blackboard and she expects her students to write to her standard without much instruction. Very tough grader as she treats her intro level history 100 class as one of her graduate student classes. Do not take unless you love history.,0
"Dr. McDermott cares a great deal for her students and want everyone sucseed. Sometimes she doesn't explain things in enough detail, but if asked she will go more in depth until you understand. She has good office hours and will make herself more avalible when midterms and finals approach.",1
"He is loud, arrogant , and very into his head. you don't really learn much since you google all of his exams. he is  super narcissistic, tries many mental games on students, and not worth taking his class. I just took his class because I had to. ",0
She is a nice teacher and well prepared but she does not go over the homework in class. ALOT of notes that weren't very helpful. I failed the class.,1
"Good Prof, great course",1
Seriously this class is hard if you have not taken stats ever. You will need to go to his office hours or the learning center to get help for homework. The quizzes are mostly 10 questions unless the class finishes early he adds more questions to the next quiz. easy if you pay attention & keep up with assignments. Book doesn't help! Show up & pass.,0
"Professor Cooper is absolutely amazing and I'm really happy I took this class with her! I'm not an art major so none of my projects were good, but Im still doing well in the class! One thing I don't like very much is that she picks favorites and doesn't pay much attention to anyone else. As someone who struggles she just walked by me a lot.",1
He is very accessible and his letters are always interesting and helpful. Every part of each assignment is reiterated over and over again so it's very hard to be confused in this class. All of the class content is organized and available on the course website.,1
Super easy class. Watched movies every now and then.  No tests at all. Lets you out super early. Not always straight forward but a super easy grader and lenient on late work.  Looking for an easy A? TAKE THIS CLASS ,1
"He's boring, but he knows what he's talking about and his class is easy. Two exams in JRN 102, both are easy if you review his study guide and read.",1
"This is the most boring course ever. I don't know if I should blame on the prof or the material itself. This is the course/prof that you don't need to go to b/c it'll put you straight to sleep.The material for the final is MASSIVE and nonsense!btw,the prof finished an entire chapter in TWO lectures!",0
"No final exam as long as you do at least 9/10 term tests. He was understandable and answers questions well. Tests are during tutorial, I would suggest to choose a tutorial after your first class of the week, sometimes questions would show up on a test I took at 8:30am and we'd do a practice question similar later that day during the lecture.",1
"Awesome professor, a god in his field.",1
Saponjic is a really good professor class is straight forward and not hard to pass. 3 test NONE get dropped. Study for the test and go to lab and you will be fine.,1
"Horrible, nervous and unsure.",0
Comes off as scary at first but hes really caring and understanding. Can be slightly harsh at marking but its not too hard to get an a/a+ once you understand the assignment. Gonna miss his class a lot,1
"She's just so classy and cool! She also tackled pretty difficult concepts and novels on top of handling a 200-person classroom with such professionalism. I give her major props. I can't decide yet if I want to take every class with her or if I just want to be her, but she's great.",1
"Very nice guy and you will learn a lot, but he didn't give out a single A in my class, one A- and that was it.  So kinda tough to get a good grade, but it's worth trying.",1
"Gipson is so caring. She is a very honest person. However she is a weird mix; she is very fumbling in her speech. Some lectures all I could do was sit through and laugh with how bad her clarity is. Still, she has teaching awards, and in her office is very helpful. Very fair grader and decent tests compared to other professors.",1
"I loved this class. While my initial interest in this class was because it was a feminist course, I honestly would take anything if Bettina was teaching it. I no longer felt like I was taking a course, instead I felt like she was explaining an amazing story. Readings and essays are intense, but very doable. I got a B+ and I'm a freshman.",1
"Scarey, hard, and sometimes mean. Gives extra assignments in clinicals as if there is not enough work. Tough, be on top of everything. Picky when it comes to assignments.",1
"Pretty sure I caught him smoking a bowl in his office once, he claimed it was an American historical artifact and he was just seeing if it worked....weird day",0
"Professor Hertz rambles a lot, but a lot of what he says is valuable information that you are able to add on to your essay(approximately 1 every two weeks).",1
"This professor thinks it is more than appropriate to post assignment solutions as early as 40 minutes before start of the final exam. Besides, she argued that this is absolutely reasonable and acceptable. Moreover, this professor rarely answers questions on the course forum. So, make good use of online open courses and teach yourself.",0
"Glaser is witty and interesting, I really enjoyed going to class. There are way too many readings and most of them are pretty boring, but you can get away with only doing a few of them. Going to lectures was helpful, but I have mixed feelings about the recitations and TAs. Fortunately, almost all of the classes are lectures.",1
love Dr. Pretzt-Merchant! Great woman! Always encouraging!,1
"She grades papers low at the beginning of the class and then high at the end, literally as a rule, just so she can say that she taught you how to write better.",0
was a great teach class was fun,1
"This was the most backwards, delusional, flat out awful class I have ever taken at GVSU. Mel might be the most confusing man I have ever met in my entire life. I would not recommend taking this class unless you enjoy having no clear direction with the task at hand and you like to sit through a 3 hour lab that could be finished in 5 minutes.",0
"he expects so much each week (peerwise, weekly quizzes, homework, lectures). on top of that, on his weekly quizzes, he mainly tests on theoretical concepts he never even covered in class. statistics isn't supposed to be taught with numbers floating around on a slide. one of the worst profs in the faculty of health science.",0
REALLY NICE GUY BUT IF YOU WANT A GOOD GRADE DONT TAKE HIM FOR A GEN ED!!! SAVE YOURSELF AND CHOOSE A DIFFERENT PROF FOR PSY 101!!!!,0
"This professor is one of the worst Ive had. Professor Smith has hardly done any of the work herself and leaves it up to her Sophomore TAs without a set grading scale to grade a majority of your assignments. While its and easy A, its if she actually grades your paper in a timely manner. Im still waiting on a huge grade and its been two months.",0
Absolutely love Dr. Capodilupo! He really cares if you succeed and is always available. His exams are really straight-forward if you study the note pack. I didn't even purchase the textbook. He includes all the info you need in the note pack and lectures. I would definitely take him again if I could.,1
"Mark knows the course content very well, and explains everything in detail. Lots of Homework, but they do help you understand and memorize materials. Exams are fair, and sometimes easy. If you do the homework on your own, then you should have no problem with those exams. In general, a very nice professor!",1
"Extremely pretentious and uninspiring. If you don't worship the French culture and think art is the only reason to live, she will probably inadvertently insult you, and you will feel miserable in the class.",0
He teaches you what you need to know. Advanced class was for people who didn't need practice writing code and just learn new context. Good guy.,1
If you're not already good in math don't take him.,0
Don't take her.,0
"i did well in her class, didnt buy the book. you dont really need it. some online quiz questions might be from the book but i looked some online and got 100s. Just have to memorize the powerpoints for tests. good teacher. id take her again",1
She needs to retire. Worst professor ever. Period.,0
"Laroche is highly confusing, lacks clarity and doesn't try to help, even in office hours. Her online classes will have you chasing your tail and pulling your hair out. Avoid at all costs.",0
"Balbert is inspiring. He is a tough grader, and name drops A LOT, but I can deal with that because my writing improved greatly in his course. He wants to get to know his students and makes a point to do so. His wit and passion made his class extremely exciting to attend.",1
"SO SO boring literally I would sit in class and play cup pong with the person next to me - he wants you to be super specific and if you don't agree you're done - need to show up every Wednesday or you're screwed, I do not recommend",0
"Joe is a great professor! I had him for BIO 121 lab and he was very helpful when we were filling out our lab reports/analyses. He truly cares that his students succeed! As long as you show up to the lab and follow his lead you will do great! P.S. I took this class in a hybrid format. Every other week we were in class, the weeks between were online.",1
"Somewhat intimidating at first, but she's a great professor - Very cute and very helpful!!",1
"Professor Qi is somewhat hard to understand, but she explains things as clearly as she can for an orgo lab. I ended up with a 98% which boosted my lecture grade. She doesn't grade that difficultly, except for the abstract. On multiple occasions I asked her a question from the assigned manual Q's and she just gave me the answer. Would take again.",1
"""Formal education is a weapon, whose effect depends on who holds it in his hands and at whom it is aimed.""  Joseph Stalin   The more you learn, the less you are certain of.   if you are not confused you are not thinking  the only person you have full control over is yourself.",1
She is HORRIBLE. She has a bundle grading system that make no sense at all. Throughout the whole class I did not learn anything. I could have received the same grade if there was no professor in classroom because she did not do anything. When doing projects she is incompetent in giving feedback. I would avoid her at all costs. STAY AWAY!,0
not a helpful teacher... really needs to get back to her students.,0
This she has a thick accent that is very hard to understand. The way the book teaches the material is how she teaches it. The equation / algebraic expressions are literally on one slide. So there is barely room to understand what is going on. The fact that she only grades quizzes and test will make it harder to pass this class. Do not recommend.,0
"Dr. Bob is a very smart guy, but class is so impossible you might want to stop while you can because if you don't, may the grace of God be with you.",0
"Not a bad prof! He is very devoted and knowledgeable, and shows tonnes of videos. Mid-term is heavily textbook-based, so study hard. Our section did very poorly on it overall. His lectures can go off-topic, but the content isn't hard to understand. 8:30-11:30am was pretty brutal though. Very thankful for the take-home final!",1
"Absolutely awesome! The only reason why the people think of his course as hard is because there's a lot of new, interesting stuff most people haven't seen before. He wants the best for his students and that's shown when he is not sympathetic about people's marks but wants them to earn their marks.",1
Dr. Hill is wacky and funny but the material is hard to understand if you don't like economics. Im pretty sure the lectures haven't been changed since 2002 and the quizes/exams are hard even after studying. He was entertaining during lecture but it's up to the students to make sure they know the material. Don't take him if you struggle with Econ.,1
"Ehrhardt is small and petty, a truly miserable human being with absolutely no concept of academic decorum. She will allow her personal views of you to completely eclipse any semblance of objectivity. If she personally dislikes you, then you will not pass, and she won't even tell you what's *wrong* with your work. Gossips about students, colleagues.",0
He's pretty terrible. Not much more to say than that.,0
"I loved Sienerth. He was very difficult and gave long exams that were hard to complete in time. -_- But I enjoyed his lectures and he was the most helpful professor I've ever had. Answers emails within ten minutes most of the time, even late at night. Always willing to meet outside of class. Really zany and intelligent guy who I would take again.",1
One of my favorite teachers on campus and a great advisor. He is very helpful and pushes you to do your best work so you can be a qualifies graduate for the working world. He is always coming up with ways to help his students be on top of their game.,1
He is very fair and will help you if you fall behind. He cares about students who care about their work. He is very knowledgeable with software as he worked with a firm that helped create Adbe Photoshop when it came out in the 1990's. Its important to explain your Graphic design work in his classes.,1
Ram does a great job at making his class as interactive as he can considering the current pandemic. He is always willing to help out any student as he wants us all so succeed. He gave a handful of quizzes and assignments but nothing too crazy. Exams and quizzes are easy if you study and go to class.,1
I did not like this teacher he is very boring and will not go on until someone answers a question in class. His tests are easy and gives you what to study. He never takes role but goes over alot in class and sometime has assignments due at the end. He gave a lot of extra credit opps. but he is a nice professor. He can be an easy A!,0
firm beliefs didnt' like being forced to think what she thought..ohwell,1
Karen Dendy is by far one of the best English teachers I have ever had! She is very organized and teaches the students well. She is very understandable to international students who don't have the English experience American students have. She will help you and check over your grades with you throughout the semester. PLEASE TAKE DENDY! I loved her.,1
So apparently I'm the only person who doesn't like Tomberlin..he's just rude and doesn't teach anything relevant to the class. I wouldn't recommend him; go with Walton for any JUS class if possible..,1
"Worst professor ever. Unfair marker, rude, and lectures are not helpful avoid at all cost.",0
Posted 1st test grade then waited until AFTER the 4th test was taken to post grades. When asked what my current average was she told me that she would tell me next week. I tried my absolute deans list best to teach myself everything and still had to drop with 4 other students (not counting the ones that dropped way earlier in the course).DONT TAKE!,0
"Worst class I've ever taken. EVER. If you can avoid him, do that. Sitting through lecture is like being tortured. And he's just such an awkward person to be around. He might know what he's talking about, but he certainly isn't very good at explaining himself.",0
"She's obsessed with Ireland.  That's all she talks about in the spring semester, before her annual trip.  If you have a problem in the class, go outside and grab a stick. You'll get more assistance from it.",0
"His classes are lecture based. There are quizzes every Monday on the chapter readings and they very specific and he expects you to take them in under 2 minutes. IDK about most but that is not enough time for me. He is super intelligent and is a funny and nice guy, but is a very hard grader. If you have no previous knowledge in the subject avoid.",0
Not recommended,0
Ross is rude and condescending and he was no help at all. I will say that he picked some interesting pieces for us to read but all in all he has been my least favourite prof,0
"I think a lot of people misread her because they don't put forth the effort to really pay attention and talk to her. She can be confusing and unclear (more so in the Research class) but seriously she has been one of the kindest, most inspirational and helpful teachers I've had here. And trust me, she's a good teacher to have on your side!!",1
She was awesome and understanding,1
"He's all but deaf, won't answer his own questions but waits for someone to finally SHOUT it.  Go to lecture, pay attention, study the material, and you'll do fine. Lab is long, don't rush or you won't learn anything. Lab exam is not NEARLY as brutal as I was told it would be, but you have to have learned something from the lab.",0
As long as you watch the videos he posts you can pass the class with an A without ever using the book.,1
I never knew what she wanted from me. Sometimes she would grade my speeches super high and sometimes it was terrible and I never knew what was what. When I asked questions I didn't receive much helpful feedback so it felt unnecessarily difficult.,0
"She's a very nice woman, but she just isn't a good math teacher. I got A's in math until I had her for a teacher. I barely passed her class, even with the help of a tutor. But she will help you outside of class.  She just wasn't the math teacher for me.",1
"Gross scared me. He is big and intimating. He calls on you randomly. If you don't understand, good luck. He is a scary dude. I do not recommend him at all. If you see that you get him, run for the hills. He won't help you if you need help. At one point I had a D in his class and I worked so hard. He was an annoying dude.",0
"I like what he did with that class. Very Socratic and if you like philosophy, you'll like it.",1
"Don't get me wrong, the class is an easy A or B. You follow his class examples, do it on the homework then repeat it on the exams with slight changes. But the professor himself is awful. He ignores emails and question. Berates you if you ask questions in class. In short, he doesn't care. You don't learn anything from him. You just memorize hw steps",0
One of the best in the department; very interested in passing on knowledge to students,1
"Il parle surtout d'histoires personnelles et de lui durant les cours, n'explique pas trÃ¨s bien et ne fait jamais d'expemples au tableau il fait simplement montrer le corrigÃ© des exercices et commenter rapidement. Bref, je ne recommande pas ce prof!",0
"Scott is great. He's really approachable and and easy grader. He incorporates fun things like watching TV shows into his class, and his assignments are never overwhelming. His class was a great experience as a first year.",1
"3 sections on the tests: lectures, textbook additional readings. the readings are hyper specific and super hard to get any info from. the lectures are totally irrelevant from the textbook and on a totally different topic of his choosing (i.e. this year he focuses on consumerism). the textbook, if u take notes, and study, you'll get good grades",0
Very approachable and knows the material very well. 2h 30min lecture can be a bit long but she tries to keep things interesting.,1
"She is all about participation you have no choice. She doesn't like to talk for a long time. She likes everyone else to talk and discuss. But, she is really funny and interesting. All texts are online and free. You will seriously love her class unless you are shy. Plus no midterm or finals! She will make you do a short presentation instead.",1
"She is the most horrible instructor I have ever had in my life!  She does't respond to emails, doesn't update d2l, doesn't grade assignments promptly, grading system is a joke, she grades and gives grades on however she wants, and she's not punctual herself but expects that from us.  Literally she makes you read the whole book. hardly lectures",0
An awesome professor to consider a course.,1
"Easily the worst professor I have had in my educational experience. The classes were unhelpful and boring, she's very disorganized and quite disrespectful. She didn't provide us with any answers to her extra questions assigned, therefore we had no idea how to come to an answer. There was no structure in this class and I would avoid at all costs.",0
"I would not recommend buying the textbook for this class. He does not really follow the syllabus because he goes on tangents and gets very far behind. If you attend class, the answers to the test are all in his lectures. There are 3 tests and he gives you a very helpful study guide.",1
There is no point in going to class. All of his lectures are posted on UD Capture. The textbook can explain concepts better than he can. He teaches very slowly and is very boring. The exams are very straight forward and not too difficult. He will curve or offer extra credit on every exam. He also curves your grade at the end of the course.,0
"Entire mark is composed of 4 Tests (lowest is dropped though) and an exam. But he makes the tests very doable and the content is never harder than the practice. His lectures are a bit messy and will take some getting used to, but they are pretty effective and if you pay attention and do the work, an A is easy. Also,very nice prof and he's funny too",1
"I took 411 with him and honestly would rather crawl into a dark hole for 2 months than sit through another class with him. It's been terrible, the amount of reading he assigns is ridiculous, and the readings are like 700 level it seems. Never once have I understood any of the 5 readings assigned each week. Tests are easy though.",0
He is by far the worst professor I have had here. He just lectures the entire class and does not care about whether or not you actually retain any of the information. his study guides are extremely large and broad and about 2/3 of the material on there is not even on his tests. avoid taking him if possible.,0
"Prof Lockerd is a nice guy, he cares about how you are doing, and is accessible outside of class. He can be pretty funny too. To succeed you do need to go, he gives random quizzes on the readings, so make sure that you read too. He does understand the amount of work you get in college, so at times he'll remove some things off the schedule.",1
"I passed this class with an A, and didn't buy the books or attend class, which proves that this teacher only cared about self-promotion and not on the subject matter,which was supposed to be about ""white racism"" and not about how wonderful Mr.Ca",0
"Lets start off with him being a jerk, he's a jerk. The day before the exam he takes off to plant trees for an experiment, ok fine. We email him about questions regarding course material and he says he'll meet us at 4 the day of the exam. So we (we being a collection of 4p, or so students) meet outside his office at 4pm. He's a no show -->continued",0
"He's pretty tough but he's understanding about things. People say he plays favorites but if you're prepared and voluenteer you will be a favorite, it's not out of your control!",1
"Alright, first off, Wendy is very smart and seems to care about her students, however this doesn't really seem to show when it comes to execution of the class. She takes attendance in a class of 180, her assignments are incredibly long, hard, and often very counter intuitive, and she seems to be very ""all or nothing"" when grading you homework/tests",0
"Such an amazing professor. Really cares about his students and their learning. Assignments aren't hard, but they are very eye opening. No tests!",1
Took her for a summer session of Biology 1.  No lecture only lab. Deffinetly put in the effort of reading each chapter and making notecards to learn materials. She briefly went over power points in class.  Let you know whats on test.  You can make an A. Takes effort!,1
"Fairly knowledgeable. Doesn't like stupid questions, so make sure you do the homework and read the textbook if you are not clear on the pre-lecture material. Exam was entirely multiple choice (very easy) to make up for poor grading on tests (by TAs, mind you).",1
Im sorry shes very nice to her students but her exams are just too hard for a 100 level class. The group projects will save you from failing. Dont take her unless you are good at geology or want to take a hit on your GPa.,0
"If you are about the class, she cares about you. You'll write two short stories and have them peer reviewed. You'll also have to give one presentation during the semester, but everything is a piece of cake. Even if you don't like writing, she makes the class creative & fun. Make friends and you'll feel comfortable. Highly recommend her as a teach!",1
"Nice guy. Hard to hear him, but helpful if you ask.",1
"I took Hip-Hop 1 and it was fun and clear, she choreographs some really great dances. She's always there to help, although on the finals she definitely grades harsh on technique and performance. But other than that great teacher!",1
English is not his first language which wouldn't be a problem if he spoke loud and clear which he doesn't. You literally have to sit in front to hear him and you'd be lucky to understand. Very Disorganized. He forgets to teach the tricks in his trick questions. Would never take him again. Avoid like the plague.,0
"Not very good, not objective in dealing with students; opionated. Avoid!",0
"His expectations are not clear. Comments on papers suggest he didn't bother to read them, when he gives feedback. His spelling and grammar is horrible, yet he expects perfection from his students. Disappointing. I learned a lot, but not thanks to him- I did the work and did extra research, which ended up being rewarding anyway.",0
"Very helpful instructor! Definitely recommend him because he goes step by step. He will also teach you some very helpful short cuts. He also cares very much for his students, and I think that is super awesome! Definitely take him!",1
Don't take him at all. I took his 8 week online history class. It is horrible. He will take off points ig you turn in dissuasions day before its due. He will grade them fast before you can even comment on two other students. I will never take his class ever again. He shouldn't even be teaching at all.,0
Lots of reading and lots of papers. Some reading may really be hard to understand but he is pretty lenient with grades.,1
If you enjoy philosophy you may enjoy him. Notes are very scattered and hard to keep track. Gets on tangents. You can tell he genuinely loves his job though.,0
Dr. Blankenship is such a great ENG 111 professor. She is very caring and her grading is very easy. All you have to do is show up to class and do the work she assigns and you will pass. If I ever have to take ENG 112 I will pick her for it.,1
"Professor Ni was nearly useless when I felt lost in his lecture. There was no guidance offered by him during office hours and he was a horrid teacher. All you do is write papers, but he is picky in content unnecessarily. If you have the option, avoid.",0
"Lectures include the ""value of a liberal arts education"" and Burton's personal past in politics, but nothing on the actual subject of the course. Course objectives were only met because of the textbook. Take a different professor.",0
"She talked to her class like we were in pre-K. She was completely unhelpful, the program glitched (almost everytime), and the tests were so hard. She's definitely one of the worst teachers I've ever had. DO NOT TAKE HER.",0
Bryan was very communicative! He made sure you knew what you needed to do. He often gave us needed breaks if we were turning in solid work. Great professor!,1
"The worst professor I have ever had throughout college. She is very passive-aggressive and gives off a condescending tone all the time. Whenever you email her, she will respond rudely and make you feel dumb. Her quizzes are literally out there to get you. She asks the most irrelevant questions which are fill in the blanks and vague. Avoid her!!",0
DO NOT take this professor!  He is mean to his students and makes class a chore.  Plays favoritism but you can probably pass his tests.,0
"This was one of the hardest classes I've had, but I got an A because I went to get help all the time.",1
"Excellent Prof for Kin150, very help full as long as you seek her help.  Written exams (short answers) are straight forward, NO trick questions, if you study, you will do good.  She marks practicals according to one's ability, and how challenging the sequence was to YOU.   Her marking is very fair, and consistent.  Keith Russells's prodigy.",1
"She is a great person and is passionate about the topic, class is really easy if you can memorize a lot of material at once and dedicate a lot of time to this class. Tons of extra credit and final can be waived if you have a good test avg. I had over 100%. Go to study sessions the night before tests-extremely helpful and gives answers to the test!",1
"I had no interest in Finance before this class, but Professor Rugemer taught it perfectly.  He speaks at a steady pace, and explains questions without jargon or confusion.  A real pleasure.",1
"dr head is awesome x 100,000.",1
She is my fave teacher here.  She is very interesting and already has something intelligent to say about any subject matter.  Very knowledgable.,1
"At the beginning of the term he posted pre recorded lecture videos, around 2-3 hours each, on Canvas and every weak made one available to view. And that's the class! So boring, really ruined what could be an interesting course. No homework, just one group project with vague instructions the whole class did poorly on.",0
"Don't take this class, ESPECIALLY if you're bad at math. He'll answer your questions, but be prepared for tough tests. He gives study guides but the tests are way harder. He gives a lot of homework, but it is all online, & the due dates are about 5 days in advance, which is a plus. He doesn't offer extra credit,or make-up tests. It's sink or swim.",0
Great teacher explains things very well. I failed math a few times before having her now I am getting 100's.,1
The most pretentious woman I have ever met in my life. Horrible.,1
"She's the worst prof I've had. Sweet but cannot teach. My friend and I compared assignments and we'd have the same answers but one of us would be wrong and the other right. Expectations were unclear, lectures boring, extremely unorganized and if you ask for clarification, she just repeats herself. You have to teach yourself. I don't recommend her.",0
"I took Organic Physiological Chem from Dr. Koeppe and would do it again. I genuinely enjoyed his class and can not imagine succeeding with any other professor. He is clear what you need to do to make grades on exams and his curriculum is setup for you to excel. Notice I said I enjoyed O-chem. That shocked me too. Suffice to say, He's good.",1
"There is a pre-lab and a lab every week. If you are not a chem major or have never done chem before, get ready to be very confused. Get on the discord group for help from other students asap if you can. This class is a lot of work and was the reason I changed my major to have less chem. All depends on how your TA grades.",0
Wow! Where do I start? I had 5 other classes and never did one class stress me so much. She gives so much work and no matter how good you think you did. You are going to miss points. Her methods of teaching are very exhausting and students end up doing the work for completion and not understanding.,1
"I had her for lab. She is overly difficult. Her grading is INSANE. She is sometimes a bit rude to students; she is definitely not a professor who would say ""There's no such thing as a stupid question."" She at least has a good sense of humor. I would avoid taking her if possible.",0
Good prof. was boring and used maple alot. The tests are easy. if you have a basic understanding of calc from high school take him.,1
she was one of my first professors at CC and I loved her teaching style. Very clear on material and how she grades. Super picky on grading. knows a lot about chemistry and passionate about it. Lots of practice problems and studying required to understand material for exams/quizzes since it is a more difficult class but manageable.,1
"Very nice, very easy. Mrs. Drake wants her students to succeed. She gives multiple opportunities to do well. If a test was too hard she gives points to make up for it. Re-do's allowed on essays/some tests. Not a lot of homework; a few essays; overall recommended class. Occasionally she gets off topic but I didn't mind.",1
"Difficult to work with. Started off the class with a test that he said he knew we'd fail, just so that we'd ""have to work to get out of the hole"". Grades hard but doesn't explain anything. Also, he seems to favor girls...",0
"Great professor! However, we watch a lot of pointless videos. If you fall asleep in class that's no problem. Just memorized her 16 page study guides and youll do fine. 3 exam, 3 current events articles and 1 group project. You'll survive. Just show up to class. There is no book needed.",1
"This class was a lot of work and was quite disorganized, so it was hard to know what was going on at any given point in time. Nothing was graded too harshly, but I never felt like I got helpful feedback. If you work hard, you will pass the class, but I don't feel like I actually learned as much as I was hoping to.",0
"Lauren is very rude and whenever you ask a question and will make you sound like an idiot. On the exams, she says everything is testable material but never goes over the textbook certain chapters in class and bases the exams largely off of those chapters. Moreover, refuses to answer questions directly and refers you to the syllabus or textbook",0
"Goofy as hell, but hes an awesome teacher.",1
"Hands down the best professor I've had at Auburn. She makes difficult material easy to understand and if you go to class, the reviews, and fill out the review sheet before tests, then you'll get an A. This is a class where if you put in the work you will learn the material AND get the grade which is rare.",1
Toughest grader. Isn't clear with what he wants. Would strongly NOT recommend this teacher!,0
"Didn't feel like I got enough out of the teacher. The class was great and I learned a lot, but I wish the teacher would have helped more. Constantly had to ask for additional instructions. I was extremely ill and he gave me a redo on an assignment, but only for a couple more hours. I wrote him when I was super sick.",0
"Coolidge is a great professor, she is the best prof out of the 3 for this sequence. This class is very extensive and will require a lot of work if you want a good grade. 2 essays which she allows rewrites on and she provides good feedback so you know exactly what you need to change. 1st semester is definitely harder than 2nd. Doesnt put in grades.",1
changed my life,1
"Dr. Hill is not a very good professor. She gives you a test and then tells you that it's the ""scantron people's"" fault that the tests don't get put into BB until a week and a half after. Do get the book because the practice problems at the end of the chapter are on the tests, as well as the questions from the quizzes. YOU HAVE TO STUDY.",0
"Dr. Simkins is very unclear in his directions, although the daily assignments and discussions are easy. Quizzes are mostly true false and are made to trick you. The essays, once again, are not clear on instructions and he does not give out very many A's. I do not recommend him, he has too high of expectations for the amount of time we have.",0
"shuts down students, can be very dismissive. rude.",0
"DO NOT LISTEN TO ANYONE THAT SAYS SHE IS A GOOD PROFESSOR. I warn you not to take courses with her. She is extremely confusing during her lectures, and is terrible at explaining concepts. If you have any questions, I suggest you keep them to yourself as you will end up more confused than you already were. If you have a class with her, good luck.",0
"Honestly, she's not that bad. Earlier in the year I left a worse review, but since then she has been putting in more effort into her slides and I think her midterms for the most part are really fair and easy to well on if you study. I switched my class so i would have here next semester.",1
I had Laura Green for one of the English gateways and 337 and I have to say I enjoyed her so much more in 337. She made the material interesting and led discussions really well and overall I think she just liked the material more. I still think about the discussion of The Handmaid''s Tale all the time.,1
"Nice guy but horrible teaching method. I had to drop the class because I fell way behind. Hes alwars confused, and its hard to follow along because he is really boring. He does try to lighten up the class by going off topic here and there.",0
"For a Child and Youth Care course, your marks will be more focused on proper use of the APA format than your actual material.  Even 3rd year English writing courses have not been this stingy regarding things such as having a bold font, and removing marks for having/not having it.  Does not recognize information from other areas of study. ",1
"Thank god hes retiring now because ive never had a more boring, monotone professor. Test are way to short so one question can screw you over and there is only two midterms. He uses wileyplus which ill never understand why. Seems like a nice guy maybe he was just done with teaching.",0
"I found Professor Mattox annoying, both as a person and as a professor. He didnt communicate well at all and when asking for help, he would provide vague answers that had almost nothing to due with the original question. Didnt seem like he cared if you did well or not. Had an attitude of I dont know, not my problem.",0
"Very helpful Professor, he gives good feedback and is accessible outside class. He responded to my emails in 24 hrs or faster and he even went out of his way to skype me to resolve my question. He gives very clear explanations with very clear grading criteria. Excellent network administration class and excellent Professor. I highly recommend them",1
"This class was frustrating. I'm a 4.0 history student, and I feel like I'm playing mind games with Gimber and can't win! He doesn't grade with a rubric or give prompts for his papers, he just says ""write me something"" and slapped a B on everything I did. When I talked to him about it and asked how to improve, he told me not to complain so much.",0
"Tests are way too hard for a course that should be straight forward. Ive taken exams in the past that were worth 300 points, but thats the entire class grade. 3 exams, 100 points each, thats it. Mainly based on Essay Questions and 25 multiple choice. Avoid if you can. If you have to take this class just make sure you dont take it lightly.",0
Professor Shannon will tell you one thing is acceptable but will take it back the next class and totally forget she said anything about it. I sat down with her for an APA formatted paper to make sure I had everything correct because it was my first AP paper. she told me everything looked great then proceeded to mark me down on my formatting.,0
"Wish I could have submitted this rating earlier, but I've been waiting since September for Mathematica to download to my computer.",0
"I can't say I really learned much in this class, but the assignments were a breeze and attendance wasn't mandatory.",1
Avoid his VLSI course. Take it at Carleton !,0
"Tinnirello is an awesome professor. He really breaks chemistry down so that everyone can understand it. He'll answer any question, and will answer it multiple times happily if people ask the same one over and over. There's a quiz every class, but its very easy and there's always lots of extra credit. You can use a cheat sheet on every test/quiz",1
Professor Bacaner is extremely motivational. The way he speaks to my soul is just so profound and touching. I took him for ENC1101 and liked his class enough to take ENC1102 with him. Would recommend.,1
"Nice guy, vague at times, memes a lot",0
"If rate my professor would allow me to give this woman a 0, I would. Horribly rude and disrespectful. She is one of the most unreasonable people I have ever dealt with in my entire life. The final was nothing we ever learned in class so good luck.",0
"Class itself is great! Senat provides great content for you to learn and makes you actually want to learn it but, then he grades extremely hard and never tells you exactly what he wants on things. Quiz everyday and you can use notes but even with notes you somehow don't know what he wants. Most frustrating class I've taken.",0
"This is her response after she put up a misleading question in a quiz ""Not all facts you are given on a test (and life!) need to be asked in such a way that NO person will ever make a mistake. The onus is on the student to read the question well and think!"" (while in fact, almost everyone misunderstood the question and got wrong answer) What a joke",0
"You have to study well even to get B! But he tries his best to help students. Overall I liked his class, not outstanding, but excellent. His test questions and practice questions are much more difficult than the way he covers things in class. Make sure you read the power point slides and book to prepare yourself well.",1
"He singlehandedly RUINED my senior year. I have developed severe back problems from hunching/stressing while studying for his obscenely long and difficult exams. Exams are 75 multiple choice and final is 100!!!!!!! Literally if you can take with anyone else, I STRONGLY advise. This is an introductory course and he does not treat it like one.",0
"The lectures are pretty interesting if you're engaged. The tests are super easy if you properly prepare and study. HIGHLY recommend going to the test review session before an exam, they'll help you so much.",1
"Please stop catering to the underacheivers. The rest of the school says its ok to reward mediocrity, but you don't have to. Lead the department in a NEW direction - one that is rigorous. Turn over control to the profs who are young & know what they are doing.  you can take care of admin for them, but start listening to those with fresh ideas.",0
You won't be graded on your knowledge of economics in this class. You're harshly graded on your ability to make pretty data visualization and your ability to summarize book chapters/articles that incorporate little to no economics. I would not recommend this class to anyone. Dr. Wooten made an interesting topic (crime economics) pretty boring.,0
"Prof Galan is a great professor.  He really knows what he is talking about, loves questions, very willing to help. Takes attendance, if you show up for class but are still struggling, this will play a big factor on your grade. Reviews for Exams are helpful, and you write 4 papers in the semester (2 on films watched in class and 2 on books)",1
He writes on the board and its really hard for us to understand what it says. ,0
"Ms. Rebecca Slate is an excellent teacher.  She is easy going and does take her time to connect with the students; does take her time to remember students names.  Lectures might be long, but at the end of the semester one would have learned much more.   She does go over the basics which is a good thing if one has forgotten.   Recommend to take her",1
one of the hardest classes ive ever taken in my life. he is no help at all and will rip you apart if you make a mistake. he may be a very smart man but just dont take him,0
I dropped the class on the first day because he doesn't let you wear a hat.,0
"I dont know why this professor has so many good ratings. He assigns over 100 pages of readings per week. Attendance and participation is required and if you dont participate your grade will spike dramatically. Additionally, he grades essays extremely harshly and is hard to understand in class. I do not recommend.",0
Avoid,0
Looks at the board the whole time while giving the lecture and doesn't explain anything well. One of the most monotone people I've met in my entire life too.,0
"He is lost when he teaches. All you need to do is go to class, listen or sleep, whatever you want. For papers, just write something down",0
"he's super helpful and cares about the wellbeing of his students. he helps students with the work, goes through the questions and explains it so they understand. I find his class engaging. Hopefully I have him in the future. 3 tests and final exam.",1
"I had him his 1st semester too, it was awful. big waste of time to be honest, I hope he has gotten better, for everyones sake",0
"The definition of 'One of the best teachers you will ever have'. She really teaches you what you need to know, and actually makes learning grammar and the overall subject bearable. I can't reccommend this teacher highly enough.",1
She is amazing. She is very helpful. She goes over what is going to be on the exams to the T. I would definitely take her again if i had to.,1
"Great guy.  Very funny, keeps class interesting with jokes.  Pretty easy tests, textbook was not required.  Likes to give lots of pop quizzes, but they are generally easy with usually one silly or very easy question.  Moves through notes kind of fast so hard to keep up at times.  Don't be a Yankees fan lol.",1
"This is my all-time favorite class. Not because it's ""easy"", but because Peter is such a good, funny professor who doesn't act like he hates his job. I think it's easy because it's in my comfort zone as an art major, but it's a great class and you learn a lot about software. The writings are easy if you keep up with them every week.",1
"Prof. C. is the most stylish and fabulous professor I have had so far. He acts tough because he really wants his students to improve and do well, but I'm pretty sure he gave our whole class A's because we had worked so hard all semester. He is very helpful and gives good feedback to improve your presenting skills. Bad at answering emails though.",1
"He is honestly the most annoying person I have ever encountered. At least half the class is spent on clicker questions or him talking about the clickers. He loves to comment on how many people respond to each question. Unfortunately you have to go to class to get clicker points, but the material is fairly easy so as long as you read you'll be fine.",1
"Vague vague vague. Many times the whole class would be confused just for a simple homework assignment. She is a nice lady, but I have avoided future Spanish classes with her. It was a boring 90 minutes with little learning. If you think you are ready for 200 level Spanish, you are. Do not take 106 if you have Spanish 4 equivalent in high school.",0
"By far the worst professor I have ever had the displeasure of taking. 100% biased and disrespectful as well as unprofessional. does not care about your grade and does an inadequate job of teaching the material. He basically turned the class into a debate hall and sat back instead of teaching. His averages on every test were horrible, DOESNT TEACH.",0
"Worst prof I've ever had. If it's your last semester and you have to take him for a math class, just take an extra semester and avoid him. Contradicts himself, auto-fails students with <60% on homework (hw is worth 6% of the final grade), and writes confusing tests. He's inconsiderate of your other classes, work schedule, and health. Terrible!",0
The absolute worst professor I've ever had at Ferris State. His grading is awful he does not help but he does bash every paper you turn in and will give you a 0 if it is not up to his satisfaction. I will NEVER recommend this professor to anyone.,0
He's so awesome.,1
Dr. Blanchard is one of the hardest professors Ive ever had. If youre a science major at kutztown steer clear of organic chemistry with Blanchard. He is more concerned with getting the notes done than making sure the students understand. He gets very annoyed with questions and turns to rude comments when too many questions are asked.,0
I can't believe he is still teaching. I can barely understand him in english let alone french....The class is a complete joke!,0
"Doctor Wood is the most communicative professor for an online class. Although there is a lot of assignments, she is willing to help however. There was an extra credit opportunity, and a fair late submissions policy. If you show that you are trying and communicate with her, you will do fine in this class. A lot of interesting discussion posts.",1
"Grossman is the Man! Always tells great stories that will help you understand the topic he's going over in class. around for extra help either through email or office hours. Quizzes everyday so make sure to read, and if he ever says We might get out early today... DON'T BELIEVE HIM",1
Professor Gabe's nutrition class was fun! I learned a lot. He responds quickly to emails and his class teaches you what you need for this class. If you study the quizzes as he said you will pass with no problems and will get a good grade.,1
"This course was definitely not a bird course. If you dont read the textbook, you wont survive. For the first part of the year I didnt even know what she looked like. The only time I received emails from her were threats about cheating/email etiquette or when she posted test grades. You dont need to watch the lectures, just read the textbook.",0
THIS PROF. WAS NOT IN CLASS ALMOST THE ENTIRE SEMESTER.  HIS EXAM IS NOT HARD; YOU DO NOT LEARN ANYTHING WITH THIS PROF.  THIS PROF. KNOWS ALOT ABOUT POLICE SCIENCE BUT IT IS HARD TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HE IS TALKING ABOUT.,0
"Awesome and fun professor. A bit on the corny side, and definitely nerdy, but really kind and gives awesome feedback on papers. Surprisingly relatable as well, though sometimes kinda tough to reach out to. Would strongly recommend taking if you can!",1
really sweet guy! great class!,1
Lectures are full of theoretical proofs. Homework is impossible. Tests are fair. The text book is very unhelpful and attending class doesn't really help because he never explains anything in plain english--only talks in math variables (not even real numbers).,0
Teacher makes you take quizzes online. You can practically google the answers for about 80% of the tests. Easy A just use google for the answers lol,1
"Dr. Tang is the lead teacher of this course, however, it is taught by many professors in the department. This makes it a little difficult for the students due to all of the different teaching styles. The content is interesting though... In class writings were easy, but graded hard. And the tests were not too bad. YOU HAVE TO STUDY AND GO TO CLASS.",1
"Nice guy but treats Intro 101 class more as a master's class. Too much material covered & ""study guides"" are just lists of what's possibly on tests; did not include what he's specifically looking for, which is relevant bc there's so much side material that you lose site of what he's considering the main points. Low class test scores so not just me",0
The best teacher.,1
Excellent man. I learned a lot and watched some interesting films. although many bored me to tears! If you don't come to class prepared don't worry he wont call on you unless you want him too and the final exam was surprisingly tricky.,1
"great guy, i sshoulda got a better grade just didn't apply myself, gives lots of partial credit",1
"Horrible teacher, went off on tangent everyday , got lost all the time. SLA is what made me pass the class. To bad he teaches the first two classes of this program.",0
"Has good knowledge, but lacks in presentation. sometimes hard to catch him. surprise tests count for grading. don't miss class :(",0
I really never read the assigned reading and still made a B in the class just from listening to his lectures and soaking everything in! So fortunate to have sailed on the SS Silverman during my time at Winthrop!! I'd take more of his upperlevels if I had more time.,1
nice,1
"She's real tricky. The midterm was so easy, like ""I'll trick you into thinking this class is an easy A then destroy you at the final"". The midterm was the same thing as the practice test she gave out so you can just memorize the steps and ace the test. But the final was yikes, maybe it was the strike, idk. but read her textbook you should be fine ",1
"She's knowledgeable in the material, she's not fair. I was told that she told other students there would be a curve and there was not. I was very close to a B and after reviewing and arguing some assignment grades, she actually took points away from my overall grade. Personally, I don't believe she should be teaching this class without a doctorate.",0
"Not just for this class, this is an overall review for Dr. Kamau. In my opinion, one of the better professormentor a student can have. Dr. Kamau truly cares about the success of his students and will help as long as you show a willingness to learn and be active in your own success. ",1
The worst teacher I've ever had. Tests are impossible and you can easily tell if he doesn't like you. Holds vendettas against kids for no reason. Class is brutally boring and I don't think there was a class where at least 3 kids were asleep. Math labs are useless and god help you if you ask for help. Can't explain the material. The worst.,0
"Holbein is one of the best teachers you can find at UK. He really treats you like an adult and doesn't make you come to class. The tests are really easy, I didn't go to class for half a semester and i got A's on every test.",1
Amazing instructor who really knows her discipline and also really cares about her students. I have pages of notes from her on topics our textbook spends a paragraph on--that is to say this professor expands on and explains the material. She does not simply 'read the book' to the class. Very good prof--take her if you can.,1
"So far the best teacher at Uni, the great champion teacher the number one teacher no body can't beat him!! he teach in first level in his hold life... he sit around and teach!!! ... he teach to himself and he teach and teach!!! HE IS THE CHAMPION THE MICHAEL JORDAN OF TEACHING IS RUSSELL ...Numbre 1 in this area!!!",1
"Well considering she has a doctorate in rhetoric, there's a LOT to learn from her. She gives excellent feedback. If she points out something, fix it and do it. She is a tougher teacher but the learning experience is worth it. This class doesn't teach you to just write papers either; it teaches you to think.",1
"Honestly, the class itself had very light and easy material but this prof made it her priority to give us a hard time. She assigned SOOO many textbook/random pdf readings which were so unnecessary. Her quizzes had questions that were not even covered in the lectures the quiz were on. Material was easy and interesting but she has to chill!",0
"Mr Mustari is genuinely concern About covering all material so you can be ready for your next course, he gives you more than enough time to finish homework and quizzes. The one downside really depends on your leaning style mr Mustari is lecture heavy/lots of proof,  no class participation. Overall a great pick in my opinion.",1
"I think Doug is a great lecturer and learned a lot from ART 208. But, he had his TAs doing all the prep work, grading, etc. I had him for another smaller class. It wasn't good. His syllabus was unclear and the course unfocused. We had no real idea what he wanted us to do, nor did he.",0
"106 - US&CA seems to be a unique class for him. No ""homework"", but only 3 tests all semester. The ""book"" is a HUGE stack of printouts, which are REQUIRED for success on the tests. If you're organized and can get all of the readings done, and can take good notes, then take him. He's quite funny, and tries hard to make lectures interesting (succeeds)",1
Unsure as to why she still continues to teach in the same manner described as previous comments or at all. She is monotoned and does not explain the materials clearly. There isn't a flow to her lectures and she will jump from one topic to another. There were times where she'd spend half an hour explaining a concept then say we don't need to know it,0
"Taking calc one in the virtual classroom in Dow is the most god awful thing ever. The layout of course material is awful. Have to complete labs about stuff we haven't learned, never know when you will be quizzed. There is no way to keep up with him because he goes way to fast. He is a very nice guy, but that won't help you pass his class.",0
"Most useless, rude, and unreasonable professor I've ever had. This is not a difficult course yet he seems to think it deserves to be treated like a weed out class, bragging about his abysmal average test scores. He intentionally aims to fail students by being completely unhelpful and unavailable. DO NOT TAKE ONE OF HIS CLASSEs.",0
"Basically any review thats terrible fits the discription of this course. Amazing woman, very sweet and caring. BUT EXTREMELY HARD CLASS",0
"Rambles on and on and on. And be prepared to be really offended. Seriously, really pompous and rude.  He knows a lot, but doesn't know how to teach it to an intro to history crowd. Assigns too much reading from too many sources, and you end up not getting much out of any of them.",0
Isabelle was super funny and very into the class. attendance is mandatory because she has clicker questions which count for many points a day. if you take heavy notes on the lectures than you'll be fine for the tests. the tests are pretty hard though but only based off the lectures and nothing else. the class is super interesting,1
"Gives a TON of extra credit (about 7%). The final was graded very leniently with plenty of opportunities for partial credit, probably to make up for its difficulty. Don't expect the exams to be similar to the practice exams. He presents situations you've never seen before, so you really have to drill the concepts rather than memorizing procedures.",1
Don't take this professor. TERRIBLE. If you're not strong in math you will fail. Expects you to know how to do everything and moves way too fast when doing example problems. If you have a question on how to do something she will tell you that you should already know it from previous classes or to read the text book or watch the videos (unhelpful),0
She is unable to talk and write at the same time and will often do the problem wrong completely. When she does speak she usually has her hand by her mouth or mumbles. Most of the time when you ask her a question she will stare at you with a blank face and then say something unrelated. The study guides don't relate to the tests whatsoever.,0
DO NOT TAKE HIM FOR BIODIVERSITY. I had him for bio 2 and he was fair so I thought this class would be a good one to get my ecology credit. NOPE biggest regret. He tries to teach us everything he knows which is very overwhelming and we end up not learning anything. About to graduate as a bio major and this is the hardest class Ive taken.,0
"This is the worst teacher I have ever had. He does not provide handouts, he is full of himself and if you ask questions he tells you to read the book. He is lazy in his teaching and does not care about his students, only about his new house in EDH. Needs to teach to be a teacher not a money collecting job holder.",0
"Best Professor Ever, Very interesting class and He definitely knows his materials",1
"The entire class was lectures. Attendance is mandatory. You only get two grades, the midterm (one in class essay) and the final (two essays). Offers some small extra credit. He knows his history, but made some statements that are simply false or just his opinions on other subjects. He also injects his politics where it isn't remotely related.",0
A 50% final with reference to specific studies and facts. Supplemental readings are a waste of time. It's really ironic how a psychology professor doesn't seem to understand the absolute basics of writing a test - misleading questions and bad grammar. Avoid this course at all costs!,0
"This class is very hard. Neurath automatically assumes you're just as knowledgeable as he is at accounting. Our SI quit and he didn't get a new one, just saying come to his office hours if you have problems. The problem is if you ask him for help, he doesn't actually answer your question or give you anything to work with. Horrible professor.",0
"He is by no means a bad prof, but I will never take him again if possible. He gives you all the exam questions before hand so as long as you study those you will be fine. Most of class is spent on tangents, and had to rush through most material because of it. Since attendance was mandatory this made coming to class difficult.",0
Classes are not mandatory but completing his homework assignment and reading textbook inside out is important to get a good grade.,1
I'm not sure why there is so much hate for Donna. She's awesome.,1
"I like Woodruff. I took her for Abnormal and Attitudes Toward Death & Dying. She's entertaining, but doesn't use visual aides, so if you don't take notes, you need to read extra carefully. What that bothered me was the suicide portion of ATDD. She almost jokes about it, and seems a little insensitive. Definitely beware of that before  signing up.",1
Get ready to fail this class. No matter what you do. No matter if you study 24 hours a day. At the end you will not pass the class. Really tough grader and very confusing. tons of homework and quizzes. you will get crazy of studying. Please Please Please do not take a class with him because you wont get good grades nor understand mathematics.,0
Class could of been more about what I was expecting to take other than something I was not even expecting to take,0
"Honestly, it went from DOWN to UGLY. It started weak and could have ended pretty bad. I didn't think college teachers would go on every single class talking about their family, their weekends, their nephews and how they're queen of a subject when they can't even help you right and can't answer their own quizzes. Just read the BOOK and take NOTES!",0
"Dr. Hart. Her review slides are longer than the lectures themselves.. babbles on about her personal life more than the protists she adores and fingi she thinks are cool. Save yourself and avoid her at all costs. Or just go off the textbook and skip class, lectures are not worth it.",0
"Tracy is great as a person. As a teacher, she isn't the worst. She's very caring and she does give fairly specific requirements for you to meet for each assignment. However, she's pretty confusing and unclear sometimes, and if you aren't willing to put in effort and communicate with her about assignments, things won't go well for you.",1
This professor ran through lectures taking little time to make sure students were following along. I went to office hours a number of times to only be shamed for not knowing the material well enough. Tests are not unbearably hard but don't expect to have any leeway with grading. One of the most discouraging math professors I have ever had.,0
Dr. Fulgham is a wonderful teacher. The work load is not a lot and he lets you redo your written papers so it's an easy A. He loves music and teaching it too. He is truly excited about this class. The in-class worksheets take 5 minutes and are worth a lot of easy points if you show up. This class was an easy A!,1
Kind of a spaz.,0
"Masterson is do-able.. but I recommend that you have some background of calc before taking him. He can be unclear and confusing. I took calc before and I got a B+ after taking him. Don't freak out, just do the practice problems from the book he gives you, they are similar to  the ones on the test",0
"He is such a good professor, very detailed lectures and tells you exactly what you need to study for. The tests are not difficult if you show up to class and pay attention to the lecture. He is very descriptive with the topics given, and if you have any questions, he is willing to answer them in office hours. Highly recommended to take his class.",1
If you take the online section beware of hours of homework. The book is terrible with little actual learning material.,0
Pretty easy course. He doesn't grade harshly and is enthusiastic about course content. Allows 3 absences a semester for M/W class. Lots of reading and short essays. I enjoyed the class and 8/10 would recommend it,1
I took his online course and this is a hard class. you have an exam and a quiz every week along with a paper or project that is due. for the quizzes and exams he gives you not enough time to complete the tests. for example you have a 30 question quiz he gives you 20 min and if you go over he deducts a lot of points. the timing is unfair. ,0
"Mary is a great woman yet has some dry material in her lectures. She's a tough and slow marker, but she is fair with her grading. Practice problems and read the chapters and you should do well. Very approachable outside of class.",1
HORRIBLE teacher. rants about how much he hates the administration too much. i mean i would too if i took leave came back and almost all my music classes were cut.  makes student's feel lesser of him. 1st music teacher that made me not want to go to class.,0
"Great prof. Go to help sessions. If you don't have him as a prof, brace yourself for the worst exams of your life. INSANE course.",1
"Bill Dean is a great professor, made an uninteresting topic, interesting enough for me to want to show up to class. Show up, skim notes and powerpoints before a test and you'll be great.",1
"Chung is the only prof who teaches this class, so if you need it, too bad for you.  The entire class is constant lecturing from slide shows she made.  and I don't know where she gets the questions for her tests, cause they're not in the slide shows.  Plus, she even lectures on test days for 40 minutes before giving the test.",0
"The lectures are boring, but you should go because you can get key information about upcoming tests and lab quizzes. I didn't learn too much in lecture, but my teaching assistant helped me out during the lab. GO TO YOUR LAB it helps. The exams are not too bad, I would recommend going through each section before the test, and going over past exams.",0
"I truly had a lot of fun taking this course! This professor in particular is super helpful, and asks questions on tests/assignments with the perfect level of difficulty. I hope to have him again!",1
"Murphy is one of those professors that you need to meet with to do well, because he is understanding and will work with you on his papers. He is not a tough grader, though. He told me straight up that if I summarized a book instead of analyzing it like I'm supposed to, Id get a solid B. He does lecture all class period though, which was hard for me",1
Best professor I've ever had. Made class fun and intresting. Wouldn't suggest him if you don't have any music background. Funny and really helps you on homework if you take the time to ask him/attend office hours.,1
"Avoid Sandy Hanson at all costs. Im not joking when I say she makes her students MISERABLE. Shes a horrible teacher I have no idea how she has a job to be honest. Shes completely inconsiderate, doesnt give a crap about her students. Not even a little bit. She basically talks to herself during class because nobody can stand to listen to her crap",0
"Awesome professor, keeps the class interesting and fun and is always there to answer questions.  He shows up early to class so if you need further help he is there.  Very cool.",1
"Tough teacher, but cares about the subject and students. On one hand, he doesn't give A's often, lectures for long periods of time, and sometimes wings class meetings. On the other hand, he will work will anyone struggling and make sure they understand what is expected of them. You will actually leave his classes with new knowledge and skills.",1
Don't take her class unless you really really don't have any other option! She is super nice and will help you but it doesn't do any good because her lectures don't have barely any synthesis and her tests are really difficult. The test seemed to be unnecessarily difficult and the multiple choice questions were horribly detailed.,0
"It was a hostile learning environment. I was treated like an idiot whenever I participated. It led me to start skipping. I liked the world politics content, but it didnt have to be torture learning it.",0
"burt himself is a very smart man, he has so much knowledge stored in his head and he teaches fairly well. the course itself is pretty easy as well, he gives textbook questions that are the ""study guides"" and a lot of the test questions are directly from these questions. lecture quizzes don't count at all still got an a and never went to class.",1
This was his first time teaching cal 1 for bio majors and he was absolutely horrible. His exam questions were completely different from the examples he used in lecture. He gave out a couple of quizzes and sometimes they were on the exams and those where the only ones i would get correct. DO NOT recommend.,0
"Great guy. He's actually the one who told me about this site. Wanted me to give him a poor rating because he hadn't gotten my paper back to me. Speaking of..where is my paper, Joe? :) J/K I've enjoyed the classes I've taken with you. I look forward to",1
"Readings required for this course were very difficult to understand - did not tell us what material Quiz 1 and 2 covered - when asked no response was given. Extremely tough course; did all readings, and extensive research and additional readings but i just found this course to be very dry and poorly executed. certain surprises on the final exam.",0
Do the homework and it's an easy A. Quizzes are straight from the homework. He drops the lowest two quizzes. Have to study for the midterm and final - his old exams on eReserves are helpful and make the exams easy. Have a group Maple project due at the end of the term but he is very helpful and even came in on weekends to help.,1
"J564 was an interesting class and Prof Mcleod gives great lectures, but there is quite a bit of reading and the tests were pretty tough. There were 5 exams, several papers and also a group project. Also beware if you take this class online that the lectures are very long. Good class overall, but be prepared to but in a decent amount of effort.",1
"He is nice enough and discussions can be lively. However, this class shouldn't be required for anyone 25 or older.  Assignments and due dates are not clearly defined (they don't match the syllabus). ""Do a writing on metacognition"". Ok, what about it? Specifics would be nice. Too many papers to write overall, got tiresome. Also, don't buy Outliers.",0
"Professor Nelson is one of the most thoughtful and caring professors out there. For our class, he decided to not give any tests and place the deadline for all assignments in December. He also cut 42 points from our final grade. This may not happen to future students, but it was a rare opportunity, and it helped my GPA a ton. Professor Nelson is a G",1
"My favorite Prof ever.Incredibly nice.You can really tell he cares about the subject and all of his students.I felt most comfortable in the environment he set up and it was fun every time I went to his class.He gave us several homework and made us to be involved with the subjects.By test questions, he built up our self confident about the course.",1
"Amazing teacher ! Very kind and very on top of emails. Each week of class is pretty much the same a quiz that you can retake as many times as you want, a discussion board, and almost every two weeks a writing assignment that is very simple, and tests every week. He definitely prepares his students for each test. Offers extra credit.",1
"Dude if you are reading these and see everyone saying the tests are real hard, do not worry about the credibility of this website. I will assure you it is very tough to do well on these tests.",0
DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS! I thought calc in high school was really easy and math is my major but now i might be switching because of this class. I dont even know if i will pass.,0
Awful professor to have if your an athlete at the school. I had her and she expects you to learn new material before the class and do the homework that you have not been lectured on. When i had a game i had to miss the class and she would not accept the hw because i was not there to turn it in when i was already gone. Would not take ever again.,0
"Ay, Ayay, Ayay...  Im not sure how exactly I got in this class but well it was not good at all. I have no idea how I got this grade but im guessing it was because I always guessed on the Tests. He did not give understandable lectures but if you keep up with the book you will do ok (I hope). GOOD LUCK!!!",0
"Professor Richards is one of the best professors I've had at Dixie. Accounting doesn't come easy for me and he really helps to make sure you not only pass the class but understand what he is teaching. There is quite a lot of homework, but he gives you full credit if you put in 100% of your effort into it. Also a really cool guy.",1
"Not my type of professor. Screams a lot. Very passionate but very serious in the way he presents. Says ""a B in his department is worth an A in any other"" so expect a tough marker. Goes off in tangents about history that are sometimes hard to follow. That being said; he's a good person with a large base of knowledge and others seem to like him.",0
This class is so hard. I know its online but you really have to teach yourself EVERYTHING. The weekly homeworks have nothing to do with weekly tests and either have anything to do with the midterms. She curves the midterms. She uses an app called Piazza for extra credit where you can ask your classmates questions,0
"even though she was a really nice and sweet lady, she has a strong accent and stumbles on her words and gets confused and mixes information in her slides. refer back to the book because even though her tests and quizzes are based off of mostly lecture and what she says, she does not put the correct info on the slides .",0
Easy class and a good one to take for those who need  extra CITE hours.  Supposed to have tons of labs but only had one.  He will help you and is involved with material. No real background info needed.,1
"Clearly used to teaching undergrads and does not treat grad student with respect when they need to miss a class due to other requirements of their major or internship, etc. Made students create class blog but she does not really understand tech. Held a class in a noisy restaurant and then lost points on discussion because she couldn't hear me.",0
"One the worse teacher I have met. At the beggining she was nice, always relating some of her personal life stories with the class, but after the assigments and group work came, she turned into a helpless teacher that you will never find out what she wants in the course, everything seems wrong to her, and very rude and disrespectful with the class.",0
Mr. Parker is an awesome teacher! While some people might view is sarcasm as quirky or mean  it seemed to me that he was trying to keep the mood light and fun.  You MUST do all the homework if you want to pass this class. The tests are hard but as long as you complete the homework assignments you should pass. I would take him again!,1
She is humorous. I like going to her class to do different fun activities for language development methods. She is very organized and clear. Personable and approachable. Kind about any questions. Take her.,1
"AMAZING teacher. Fantastic sense of humor, easy class if you pay attention, extremely helpful with everything, it's a great class. Lindsey is AWESOME. =]",1
"Dr. Bottomley made the somewhat boring class that is E101 interesting and worthwhile. She is hilarious and wants her students to do well. Definitely go to her for any problems and questions you have with FEDD because she is very helpful. She is a great lady to know, and I would take a class with her again.",1
"As someone who has experience coding and enjoys it, I did not mind the 6 projects, but they will be confusing for most people new to coding. Before and after the coding part of the semester, he lectures on boring IT info. The midterm and final, both essay exams, test on a fair amount of material. In-class quizzes every Wed. Pointless class imo.",0
"Great lectures and labs are enjoyable. The individual programming assignments are huge in comparison to the labs, but you have two weeks to do them. Not a very helpful professor when you ask him a question, and he's not very understanding or lenient. ",0
"Hanks is inspiring. He really wants all his students to do well, and believes in us - although most in my class neglected the readings. Mandatory attendance, and recommended as well because lectures are essentially the only test material. His field study was VERY hands-on, as in he was trained as a Maya shaman. Highly recommend taking his class!",1
"If you get easily distracted don't take him, the class is extensive and it can be stressful, gives a test after completing 4 chapters. Makes things harder than what it seems. No participation is required at all. You just have to go to class and listen to him talk.",0
"Professor Epstein is a wonderful teacher. He is kind, compassionate, and extremely intelligent. He is like a walking encyclopedia and his lectures are filled to capacity with information. If you are interested in learning and love history, take his class.",1
"Dr. Gwara is incredibly knowledgeable about the subjects he teaches, especially Old English literature. However, he's also very enthusiastic when someone brings up an idea or makes a point he hadn't thought of before. He's not shy about praising students and is just generally a very nice guy.",1
Too much sass. Very disrespectful. she made one of her students cry. Shows no remorse. Speaks in 3rd person. worst accounting teacher  ever. look somewhere else or you will get the worst time of your life.,0
"Amazing! One of the most engaging lecturers I've ever had. Very clear, concise, and actually rather entertaining. The class is pretty intense - lots of reading and attention needs to be paid - but with a bit of effort the course is really worth it. I would recommend it to anyone.",1
Professor Stolba is strange and rude. Do not take this class unless you have no choice. The information is useless unless you have some burning passion for anthropology. She is a sub-par professor at best and it was very difficult to sit through her intellectually-absent lectures. The tests and lectures are often unrelated. Avoid this prof.,0
This professor was very nice.,1
"I LOVE THIS MAN.  I am a Social Welfare major, and  took this class on a whim (and because he got really good ratings!)  I learned more in this class than in any other.  BY FAR the BEST professor I have ever had.  Didn't miss a single class, and left wishing that there had been more!  Interesting, funny, ridiculously intelligent, a really nice guy.",1
"1- She doesn't prefer to impart or react legitimately. This is an online class, and she should react to any scrutinize that befuddles an understudy. 2- Not very evident. She allows a 4 hour test like clockwork without giving the fundamental inquiries previously we tap on the (take test). 4 hours test is extremely troublesome for English 124 under",0
"She knows just about everything there is to know in regard to art techniques and useful skills/tricks. She knows nothing about being friendly. Unnecessarily yells at people and is rude. Gives excellent critiques and advice. Take the class to learn a lot, just don't take her sharp remarks personally.",1
Teaches ok but exams are very irrelevant to the coursework from Smartbook and Connect. Her brother apparently works at the IMU bookstore in which she will half force you to buy course packets from there. Wondering if there's anything fishy between her brother and her collaboration.,0
"Has a quirky sense of humor that is great in the middle of a lecture. Just an all-around awesome guy!! Class is simple, and still really cool. Simple math skills for the exams, otherwise, not much effort required and his slides are the reason to go to lecture, if you don't find astronomy interesting, that is. (Im a CSE major)",1
"Ugh! This guy was terrible. Never take his class, I fell asleep every morning.",0
"This class is very interesting but dont sign up unless you are ready to go to every single class. You get 10 points off your attendance grade every time you miss a class, which counts as a test grade. and 10 points off if youre caught on your phone. the lectures are very interesting though and always have guest speakers. tests you can find online",1
I wouldn't recommend this teacher. she is smart but she only talks to students that are music majors in the class and she doesn't post grades at all during the semester. If you ask why you received a grade on a assignment she will tell you that she doesn't know why because she doesn't have a rubric.,0
He is nice and encouraging.  I'm just not good at economics.  He is hard to understand sometimes and goes off on tangents.,1
"TrÃ¨s, trÃ¨s bon cours!! Je le recommande fortement!! Les intras et l'examen final ne vous surprendrons pas et sont juste. Excellent prof!! ",1
"Very confusing about the projects, looks for specific she never mentionned.",0
"We gave this professor multiple chances to lecture properly. Half way into the semester and he continues to read off the slides. He tells us we have to learn the material on our own. When my classmates would ask him for an explanation on how to balance equations or to give us examples on how to do the material from the homework, he cannot explain.",0
"Mrs. Parker is the absolute best teacher I've ever had. She cares about all of her students and really makes the experience overall fantastic by good one-on-one time, as well as overall lectures in class. She is very patient and will work out any problems you have with you so long as you are willing to work hard!",1
She is the most unprofessional prof. She rushes through lectures without even teaching us anything. She gives lots of labs and group work. She does not try to helps students. She is very harsh and rude if you dont do something that she likes. Id skip her at all costs. All she cares about is a low average of the class.,0
"Alright I was just warned by my advisor not to take this lady because there has been tons of complaints about her lack of teaching, everyone fails and complained to the committee to be able to get out and drop the class,overall she doesnt teach she just tells you what to do and you learn on your own. Take it with someone else.",0
Very good sense of humor making information and class time fun!,1
"Tracy was a good teacher, and if you needed help she was there for you, but man her class was terrible. Year long english was not the way to go. Not much guidance, you really interpret her assignments your own  way. No motivation for the class.",0
"Gives hw where you actually do math, however, midterms were not like that. You mostly answer why and how something is the way it is. Did not expect this on the first midterm which dug me into a deep hole.",1
"Be prepared to use the textbook and to read. The quizzes arent hard but the wording can be tricky. Make sure to take your time and to read. His classes is based on a weighted system, so make sure you stay on top of your grade.",0
he teaches what he has to but he reads straight off his slides like the whole class is retarded and cant read for themselves.very unhelpful and arrogant. he picks on even the best students if he thinks u might have spaced out for a sec and makes an idiot out of u. he is never wrong! i had him from 835-1045pm and he'll never let out a secbefore 1045,0
"Nice guy,  awful in lecture. He did not even look over the exam before giving exam reviews (he specifically said that one reaction was not important when the second exam question was a paragraph about that reaction). He did not look at lecture slides before giving lectures. Orgo is a hard class anyway, taking him will put you at a disadvantage.",0
"Dr. Sethna is knowledgeable in her field, but her rude comments in class make it not worth it. Makes sarcastic comments and comes off a bit elitist. Very lecture heavy, no laptops allowed. The notes are not posted online so make sure to attend class. Overall the class material is interesting, but could be taught better.",0
I enjoyed the way he laid out the lecture material on the board and walked through it before doing practice questions. I would give him a 5 but it was difficult to hear him at times during the lecture.,1
Critiques lesson plans way to hard!,0
"I can't quite understand why people are saying she is a good professor and then comment on how they never had to go to class. A good professor will teach unbiased, important, relevant material that will inspire a student to  come to class and want to go above and beyond the curriculum. - Terribly boring, irrelevant class laden with her opinion.",0
"Dr. Noggle has been one of my favorites. The class isnt difficult if you go every day and take good notes either. He's always available in office hours and gives really good help then with anything you need. The readings are hard, but his lectures are easy to follow and he explains everything well. Definitely one of my favorite professors",1
Classic arrogant professor; intelligent but hard to approach.,0
Agreed She sucks ...avoid taking eac with her save ur self the headache,0
"She's great!! I had no idea what polisci was about before the class and she really got me involved. I like argueing and she would argue with me in class about stuff, really fun! She won't really call on people if they don't wanna talk really. You don't have to go to class. all the test stuff is in the blue book and vanbell & mash",1
Awesome teacher.  Cares about his students.  Really fun Class.,1
"Absolute worst experience I've ever had in 5 years of undergrad. Prof was extremely unprofessional. Late with grading, selective with which forum posts to reply to, so many mistakes in tests and assignments. Gave us assignments on material we had not learned. Stay away from any class taught by Rosu.",0
"Her class is wicked hard and the lectures outlines are all online. However, you do need to attend class as she takes attendance often.  Her voice is very soft at times and it will lose you. You will have three tests one paper and a final. The tests and finals are easy to fake, the paper is tougher to fake. Spelling counts on everything that you do!",0
"she's extremely condescending and rude in her grading, not constructive at all",0
"This egghead may well be a genius.  One warning...come to class late in the day, hyped up on caffeine, because his voice will put you to sleep.",1
"What isn't taught in class, and was planned for the day, is taught in office hours and never again. He has ""secret words"" that he says one time and never says them again that end up being important on tests. Makes students feel stupid for asking questions and finds it funny when students get bad grades. However, he is very qualified to teach.",0
Tough grader,0
"Material in the course isn't all that hard, but the way she presents it makes it more confusing than it should be. I learned more from the discussion section than lectures.",0
"Didn't know what was going on in this class. But if you go to class, take good notes, and study, you should do fine. He fills in the notes during lecture, so missing class should never be an option.",0
she is the wort. she is an old and ugly teacher who needs to go home. the worst class I ever had in my life,0
"Prof. Pabel's class was certainly challenging and required a lot of time and effort, but unlike many other history classes I have taken, I actually feel I truly learned a lot about the course content. He has a lot of knowledge on the topic of European history and his lectures were always thoroughly prepared.",1
Great professor! Taught me marketing in such an effective way. Trevecca is blessed to have such a knowledgeable and effective professor,1
"Super funny guy. There are random in class assignments so its your best interest to show up. 2 test, 3 quizzes, 5 assignments. 10/10 would take again.",1
"The material can be difficult conceptually if you're not a math person. Just make sure you actually do the homework and know how to do the equations (no Chegg). As for professor Riggs, he rambles and gets off topic so often it's hard to follow. If you have problems staying focused, this is not a good lecture for you.",0
"I took this class online for Spanish 101, and I highly recommend it.  The course is clearly laid out right from the start and the weekly assignments were very reasonable.  I actually enjoyed the online work.  She drops several homework and quiz grades, so it's pretty flexible.  I took another instructor for 102, and it wasn't nearly as organized.",1
Margarita is the best!!!,1
"Holmes is the BEST! He is super funny and has the best lectures ever!! He made a super smooth transition from in class to online due to COVID-19. His class is simple, and the lectures are what is on the exam. As long as you take good notes and study, you will be fine! There are 4 exams total, and one short paper! He offers extra credit, too!",1
"The worest professor that I have met in my first semester. You don't want to take his class again. He is a tough grader. You need to speak very loud and slow to him. In class, he doesn't teach any useful things. Final grade runied my life. I am not deserved to that. God knows. But who care. Fortunately, it is 2 credit course. It doesn't affect alo",0
"Doesnt teach the material, then expects you to understand difficult problems that she doesnt even know how to explain or do. Avoid this professor she doesnt know what shes talking about or how to teach.",0
"Prof Blacker is honestly one of the best profs I've ever had. He genuinely shows that he cares for his students and his class is pretty low-stress. You don't really need to show up, but if you don't be prepared to memorize a lot of cases. 3 exams (50 multiple choice questions) and a small 1-minute presentation",1
The work we do in class does not make any sense with our homework. We do work online which makes no sense since this is a math coarse. When we ask for help she is very unhelpful and does not explain anything.,0
"She's awful!!!!! I had an online class with her. Slow response, & because she wouldn't response quickly to my email. I would do homework incorrectly & endedup getting a bad grade.  She's awful!",0
"Doc is undoubtedly one of the best professors I have ever had the fortune of working with, primarily because he is enthusiastic and consistently encourages his students in their work and their goals. Very bright, infectious energy. contrary to what the haters say, Doc doesn't hate conservatives, he just hates illogical arguments. clarity + cite = A",1
"Do not take this professor. Her feedback is so vague and does not help at all. I had two 2hr classes with her and she would spend the first hour telling us why our writing is terrible and the other hour in group work which does nothing. A huge stickler on attendance. Forget one book? go home because you'll get marked absent. Overall, she's annoying",0
"I took professor Aguilar my spring semester for 1302 and I would not reccomend to take her. She gets distracted very easily and gives assignments that are six pages long, sometimes more. She does set the boundaries straight from the beggining of the course and she will not take late work.",0
"Dr. Woods is very unorganized , and she does not put in grades on D2L so check on your grades frequently. The class was easy, many presentations and quizzes. Attendance is mandatory during presentations, because you will be required to do peer reviews. This is a big part of the grade that is not listed in the syllabus.",0
"Seems to know everything in her own perspective, but really can's give to students, her whole thoughts in class is messed up.",0
JUST GO AND YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE TO SING. MOUTH IT AND YOU WILL GET AN A!!!!!!!!!!,1
"Showalter is a good professor overall. Graded by few things, about 10 quizzes and 3 exams. So if you get behind on lectures and don't do well on quizzes, it'll hurt. Average lectures, about 1 quiz per week. Quizzes are through a Pearson application, so it follows the book not lectures and are sometimes hard. Pretty easy to keep up with.",1
this man is amazing,1
"If you have any aptitude for mathematics or physics, this class will not be difficult. Lectures go at a snail's pace. I did not show up the last month of lecture and still received an A in the course. When he lectures, he confuses more than he helps. Great sense of humor; nice guy  overall. Take Estrada if you already know Physics, not to learn!",0
"Favorite prof. this semester. Tests are easy -  vocab-based & he tells you exactly what you need to know. His lectures don't help much with tests, but are amazing and interesting. He knows what he's talking about. Great guy. I went to his office hours multiple times. He's easy to talk to.",1
"Brilliant!  Turned me into a better writer, because there is no ""great writers"" according to him!",1
Great prof! Made sure you fully understood how it really was in industry and didn't care about specific little details as long as you learned something.,1
One of the most boring classes I have ever taken. The lectures are long and boring. I learned virtually nothing out of any of his classes. You have to study hard and for long periods of time because if you don't you will not pass. Even if you do study hard the questions don't correlate to the lecture. He has a lot of gotcha questions on the exams.,0
"One of the best professors I have ever had. Extremely intelligent, very nice, and a fair grader. A lot of readings but she simplifies them in class. Very approachable outside of class, and you learn a whole lot. She is the absolute best.",1
"291 is one of the harder COB prerequisites and she does everything she can to make sure we are learning. A lot of these reviews are definitely from the slackers who didnt give this class the time of day. Tests are definitely hard, but if you study and do all the practice problems you'll pass. Other than that its 4 excel homeworks that are easy As",1
"Really nice guy, but never uses blackboard or his email.  It's super hard to know how you're doing in his class because you never have any indication of where you're at.  Also, the guidelines for exams, assignments and papers are not explained well.",0
Good class even though I didn't do so well. I didn't hand everything in but still did ok. All the work has clear grading rubrics - that's good.,1
Took her freshman class.  Very interesting. papers were the only grade and shes a fairly good grader.  I would take her if you have the chance.  work load is reasonable,1
"This class made me actually regain a liking for math. Great professor - clear teaching, really breaks down problems, reviews for exams, answers questions after class. It's not an easy subject - homework takes about 4 hours to complete, but once you get into it, it's formulaic. You should make an A as long as you study the formulas & attend lectures",1
"Liz was by far the worst professor I've had. She was such a difficult grader, and her comments on papers and quizzes was condescending and rude. She was not helpful at all, and didn't seem like she had student's best interests at heart. Her lectures were so boring, she talked very quietly and most of her lectures were just plot summary anyways.",0
Very interesting class. Great activities. Fascinating guy to talk to.,1
"All lectures are very clear. Don't buy the book, you can google search all the readings or summaries of the readings. Just study his lectures and you'll pass the exams. He's a great prof and classes are enjoyable. Show up because he does take attendance occasionally. ",1
"Burg teaches science to anyone like they are science majors. She knows what she's talking about, but isn't particularly good at communicating it, especially since her speaking voice is just above a whisper. Also, some of the hardest tests I've ever taken.",1
Greatest math professor taken in collegiate career,1
"Weil is a terrible professor and really is not a teacher. He's a bully and gives zero feedback on papers. Watch your word count, yes he counts words and doesn't read your content of your assignments if they don't have enough word count. He's pompous and ego driven (his ego) BEWARE of this professor and do NOT take him for a class!",0
"This guy is majorly unprofessional. Not only does he send emails without salutations, but he forgets to post essential notes needed for writing assignments. When you email him about said notes, he rudely responds and acts as if it is your fault. Clearly he thinks this 100-level is SUPER IMPORTANT.",0
NEVER take this class online. Or at least not with Fink. The course material is too vague and you CANNOT teach it to yourself. Awful class that I will probably have to retake now because it was so hard.,0
"By far the absolute greatest advisor, program director and professor I could have ever asked for. She is so kind, caring and down to earth. You can talk to Dr. M about absolutely anything and never feel criticized or looked down upon. Her course content is applicable in the world and she has a wonderful, memorable way of instruction in all courses!",1
"Great teacher, study the study sheets and practice exams.",1
"Mancinelli is amazing!! Seriously one of the most amazing people I have ever met. I've taken several courses with her. She's THAT good! She's very knowledgeable in everything she teaches. She's very caring. She's gives you what your give her. She up, participate, and do the work. Easy A!!! Very inspirational and humbling. Absolutely love her!!",1
"He is brilliant. Go to every class because he doesn't use textbooks. His lectures are the most interesting and informative I've ever had. Tests are difficult, but you will get more than your moneys worth for any of his classes. He's also very funny and has a lot of professional experience so he is able to relate his lectures to real experiences!",1
Pretty easy for a college statistics class; however I got A's on all three exams and somehow received a B as my overall grade. You don't need to go to class or purchase the textbook. All exams are open-note/phones and laptops are allowed. The online homework/exams are pretty difficult.,1
"The class itself is hard mainly because of the material, it is all memorizing but  doable and more than possible to make an A in the class. You will learn. Sieber is very caring and understanding when it comes to helping her students. Just focus and ask questions. Oh and she gives extra credit on her exams which is a plus.",1
He is beyond boring! He tries to crack random jokes but everyone is half asleep and doesn't care. Don't take him. It will make for a miserable semester!,0
Honestly the worst professor I have ever had. She just reads straight from the slides and doesn't know how to explain anything or answer any questions. Gives iclicker quizzes but doesn't teach you how to answer them till after you take it and you get it wrong. Impossible to actually pay attention. She also wears 2 dresses the whole semester,0
"He's crazy but amusing. Don't bother doing the reading because you never talk about it and he tells you what evidence to use in your papers. I took him as a 6-9 and just worked on other class stuff on my laptop the whole time while he rambled incoherently. Also, it takes months to get your papers back.",1
"Tom is an awesome professor! I took his class online and there is a bit more work than one would expect from an online class (seeing live shows and completing 20 service hours) but they are very much worth it. His class is very well laid out and easy to follow in BB. Do the work, stay on top of it, and the class will be a breeze.",1
"I had english with Dr. Stephens this spring, and she's ok.  But make sure you hand in all your work, because she has a tendency to forget things and blame you for it.  Her midterm and final had nothing  to do with the classwork tho...",0
"This course and HTM 402 need to be re -evaluated. They're awful and are made worse by Wade. Unlike other professors who tell you all that they want for a project in one single document, he scatters information into tiny bits and pieces making everything ambiguous. His marking is all over the place and often contradictory.  Exam's were unfair too.",0
"Easy class!  He will never reply to your emails if you don't have ""IDS 180"" in the subject or your first and last name in the body.  The homework is easy and you don't need prior knowledge of any of the programs.  You also don't need the book, just review the powerpoints.",1
"Throughout the year she never input any grades and when reaching out, she would not respond to emails. Eventually towards the end of the year, she announced that her computer was the issue and that it somehow inhibited her ability to release grades. There's a quiz every class but the catch is she only collects 6 so if you miss class u may be SOL",0
"To be frank, I found him to be fairly boring and useless when it comes to being clear in his discussions. He focuses on one subject and applies it for the whole quarter... If you are interested in Shakespeare, I advise you all to take him. If not, avoid the class and take a different subject.",0
"Although he has a monotone voice (which can be a drag in an evening class), he is a very enthusiastic professor who cares for his students. Just do your work and you'll be golden. He also gives out a few extra credit opportunities.",1
I am a Biology major at UNT and I have never done this bad in a class before. I've never received a C before and I'm struggling to pass his class. DO NOT TAKE. I asked him a few questions in class to clarify and he makes you feel dumb. He's an ass in my opinion. Not the worst teacher but his test are extremely difficult.,0
Strange class. In class materials/lectures did not co-relate to tests/final exam. We paid a lot for text books but only used it once for in class presentation. In class debates are also unfair. She must prepare us at least once before giving out random assignment.,0
She really cares about what she is teaching and you can tell by how she conducts her lecture. The tests and quizzes are tough but she really wants you to pass her class so go to office hours.,1
She is the most boring lecturer I have ever had. She makes the clicker questions easier tho.,0
"I've had him for two classes and each was the same. Doesn't take attendance or teach anything at all, and there's honestly no reason to go. As long as you read the stories on your own time and do the assignments you'll be fine.",0
"wow words can not describe how great of a professor, professor Quinlan was! even though it was a 4 hour class, he made the lectures fun and really interesting. He incorporates a lot of personal stories when giving lectures which really helps you understand the material better. The only downfall to his class that the test are worded weird. An easy A",1
"Professor Anderson is an average teacher. His pros are that he shows some interesting videos in class, gives study guides, and explains the readings pretty well. His cons are that he doesn't teach as much as you may like for a philosophy class, has quite a few absences because of his kids, and it sometimes isn't clear what readings were assigned.",1
"Yes his class is hard but his job is to teach, not just to pass lazy students. Do the readings, study, and participate in discussions. He grades by performance, not by points, so make the effort by reading, participate,and office visits. This class will be as easy or as hard as you make it.",1
"Professor MacNeil was so rude and no help. I felt like I didn't learn a single thing from him all of his assignments are all the same and it doesn't teach you anything. When assignments are submitted he only criticizes your work. He gives you criticism at the end when your final is due and you have no time to even fix it. Overall, worst professor.",0
"incredibally boring. do not take him in the morning. 910 = bad.  he is uber old and thinks stupid things are funny. he doesnt have a rubric for grading tests, so its whatever he ""deems"" necessary.  stupid class...",0
He hates it when your phone rings in class. He can be really intimidating but the class isn't hard to get a good grade. No homework.,0
"I took this 122 course the honors english composition writing course my first semester at racc. I was an honors english student all through HS and got placed in this class through placement test. This teacher is HORRIBLE, you ask her to revise your paper as a rough draft she marks everything you've done wrong but gives no feedback. unorganized also",0
"Dr. Merat is truly an excellent professor.  He gets his point across and made even difficult material easy to understand.  The fact that he provides past quizzes and homeworks just goes to show how committed he is to helping his students learn, not just wanting to do his research.  Easily the best course and professor in the ENGR core.",1
"There's a reason there aren't any positive reviews for this professor. Reads slides during the lecture which can be found online, going to class is completely pointless. midterm much harder than the quizzes and homework and he doesn't curve grades, so good luck.",0
"Lecture's are long and she often doesn't reference painting she is analysing, often does not proceed in a coherent way, quite messy",0
Average professor and average class. Do the homework and you will be fine for 111.,1
"This professor takes you with him on a journey through italian culture and history. He is intelligent, creative, and challenges you to think in ways you may never have prior to taking a course with him. He has an old soul and is very wise. I highly recommend taking a course with him.",1
"Mr Mohebbi is a below average teacher. He is a funny guy but clearly not a good teacher. His accent makes it so hard to follow what hes saying. His work on the board is so confusing. When you ask him a question, hell make fun of you. So many people were so frustrated in my class due to lack of communication. This guy is an insult to teaching.",0
"Professor Sinniah is hilarious and really smart. His lectures are important and go over past tests and practice problems.  Definitely go to review sessions that he sometimes has. People say 104 is hard but if you take it with him, it will be fun and actually very manageable. His accent wasn't a problem for me.",1
Avoid signing up for him. Run as fast as you can!,0
"Cooney is a great teacher and has really enjoyable lectures however, he treats the gen ed astronomy class like it is an upper-level science course. He says that he does this at the beginning of the class and is going to treat the semester like everyone is an astronomy major. This resulted in the class having way too much work for a gen ed class.",1
"Had Kim for several classes over the years- great teacher. Very understanding, very involved. Didn't think I was a big fan of contemporary art before this class, but she showed us some amazing things. Never had trouble on her tests myself, she gives study guides that show you what pieces might be talked about and if you take notes you'll be fine.",1
Awful.  Arrogant and completely out of touch with students.,0
"Dr. Scott is brilliant, but unfortunately needs an education class. She's inconsistent with grading and changes the syllabus a lot. Laugh at her jokes, be a liberal, and revise your papers, you'll probably get a B+. Oh, and she's really, really big on classroom participation, so raise your hand often! Overall, she's not my favorite, but not bad.",1
"A newer professor. She's nice. Easy class. Keep up on CC to know assignments. Projects every month (easy). One presentation. TAKE NOTES, she grades notebooks regularly. Quizzes often. Attendance isn't mandatory, but lots of in-class assignments/quizzes.",1
"He acts 'nerdy' but does it with a humor about himself. Helps do almost all the homework. And you don't have to read, his lectures explain everything.",1
I think he is one of the BEST professers around!,1
"While he does know the the subject matter well, he spend most of his time writing on the white board. This is a problem, because his is writing is completely illegible. The hardest part is the tests. All have to be hand written answers to multi part questions. The final took me 2.5 hours and 7 hand written pages. Avoid this teacher at all costs.",0
"WORST PROFESSOR IVE EVER HAD. And that says a lot because Ive had a lot of other bad profs. Ur better off taking a chem or bio class for ur science credit. Not understanding at all, save yourself the stress and dont take her",0
tests were hard and the final is worth 50% of your grade!,0
"Maybe he's good at teaching all the Calc courses, but to me his teaching style was bad for Precalc. During summer more than half the class dropped and it is because he grades so harshly and doesn't give enough time to complete quizzes and exams. He rushed through lectures. I got marked off points for checking my original answer using another way.",0
"So funny! Rants about his own experiences but they are funny & helpful bc he connects them back to the material. Wants everyone to pass! If you show up on test day not feeling confident will let you take it another day. If you get a bad test score you can make it up with an essay. Go to his office hrs for help, he is really helpful. Very nice!!",1
"I was looking very forward to this class, however, taught myself the information. This was the first online class I have had at FAU where I did not receive much feedback and professor was somewhat disengaged regarding class discussions. Also final is 30% of your grade and you are on your own, no study guide and no guidance on what to focus on.",0
Outstanding dedication. He cares about his students to the point where he can remember a lot of our names. Extremely helpful and patient in office hours and eager to help you learn. He continues to ask for feedback and acts on it to make his already excellent lectures even better. 11/10 would take a course with Alfred again.,1
Definately the hardest prof Ive ever had in all my accounting courses. She is good with explanations and really tries to make you learn. Very helpful outside of class. Exams however are very tough. She expects alot. Average for midterm was 50% and our final was not much better. There is a tremendous amount of work needed. Do not expect high marks.,1
"If you have this man as your professor, be wary, you are in for a very spicy experience.",0
"I feel like perhaps professor Lucas is too advanced in computer science to teach an intro course.  At times it seemed like to she couldn't explain certain concepts plainly enough, regarding Java programming specifically.  At one point, I felt completely lost, and wouldn't have passed without the help of some rather bright classmates.",0
His lectures are interesting but long. There is 3 speeches and one paper. The tests are all about what he lectures on with some book questions. In class we get into group sometimes or it is a lecture setting. I would take him again!,1
"She's tough. But, if you pay attention in class and participate she'll teach you a lot. There is a lot of papers and quizzes. But, if you work hard she'll help you with your resume, cover letters and help you find an internship.  ",1
"One of the best professors I've had so far ! He reminds me a lot of my junior year history teacher. Very passionate about the subject he is teaching and will throw in a joke or two to try and make the class entertaining. Love when he brings in his guitar to sing songs associated with what we're learning. Amazing man, would definitely take him again",1
"This subject is actually really easy, however I'm convinced that every professor who teaches this tries to make it harder than it seems. This is my 2nd time taking this class and I decided to take this professor but she's not any better than my previous professor. I'm not sure what advice I can give you- all the professors suck for this subject.",0
"Professor Schuster seems to have a passion for history which makes him interesting to listen to, his lectures are interesting and informative.  There are 2 papers and 2 essay exams for the class, they are set up fairly but he grades very hard.",1
"Avoid him. He does know telecom staff, but he cannot teach at all. Looks nice, but in reality he is not. Would not recommend him. He makes easy material very difficult. Very messy and disorganized. He is not a hard grader, but if you want to learn something for your major, try to avoid him. There are much better professors on Telecom department.",0
"Really knows his stuff, but his assignments and tests are tough.",1
"Dr Lu is SLOW grader, gives little constructive feedback. Peer edits are a joke because no one brings work in any condition to edit. Obviously, the students do not respect his timelines. No rubrics for work, but tough grader. Offers opportunity to rewrite papers for better score, but rewrites due before he finishes grading 2 original submissions.",0
Talks and talks and talks. Keeps classroom way too dark. Puts things on test that are not in any book.,0
"This professor expects wayyy too much out of his students for a 244 class, I bought six different books for this one class. It's unclear and difficult how to achieve an A in the class as all the guidelines only detail how to achieve a B in the course. If you aren't a kiss up, it's going to be needlessly difficult.",0
"Great professor, very laid back and chill. Only homework was reading, but it was a lot of reading, and had a only a few papers and one final presentation and final. I suggest this professor and class, had the reputation of easiest sequence. Had a lot of down time compared to the others.",1
"He is a very knowledgeable, and funny guy. He really cares about you, but he's definitely a teacher that expects a lot out of you. You have to attend class, pay attention, and take notes to get a decent grade.",1
"hated this class, hated him.",0
"Mitra is an awful professor who has been reported to the board numerous times for inappropriate and disrespectful behavior. He actively demeans his students when they ask questions and only caters to a select few that he devotes 99% of his time and attention to. If you aren't part of that small group of students, Mitra does not care about you.",0
"Easy class, Dr Sobhi is not a strict guy. But he's not a great teacher. His instructions often vary greatly from what's in the lab manual and when you ask for help, he's incredibly unclear. He doesn't post grades on Blackboard and when he hands back graded papers they just have a number written on top, could be out of 40 or 100. Who knows.",0
Useless class... unreasonably difficult test to compare his usless speach in class,0
Avoid her class She also wants you to do community service Just dont take her,0
"Prof. Pave was very enthusiastic and knowledgeable about what he taught. Always able to answer questions and give amazing stories about religions. A lot of quizzes & writing assignments, but they're not difficult at all if you just read the textbook. We had to read 2 additional books which were very interesting, and his feedback is great & detailed",1
"Avoid taking her for Phisiology. She is extremely horrible instructor for this subject and should not be allowed to teach it. She doesn't answer her emails, she is not thorough about what is covered on her exams. The study guides are almost useless. She is not very clear in explaining the material on her PowerPoints. This is by far the worst class!",0
Lexa was an excellent professor.  She was truly engaging and respectful of her learners.  She created a great environment for dialogue and furthered learning with interesting anecdotes and activities.,1
"This is one teacher who makes it really hard for you to fail. You would literally have to skip every single lab and lecture. If you try, you will pass. I ended the class with almost 120% and didn't even have to take the final.",1
Doesn't teach well. Fails to give adequate examples of test material but makes her own tests there not real hard.,0
I took her claas and got an A- with little effort. EnvConc Psych was very chalenging though. She's the most kindhearted person ever. I was also her TA. I can't wait to take more of her courses. easy going and laid back.  Her grading is totally straight forward if you do you assignments.  She's young and fun and loves her job.,1
"Gordon Anderson is the worst prof at York. He doesn't communicate with students at all, takes forever to post grades and doesn't give any feedback whatsoever on assignments. He has extremely high expectations for students but holds himself to a very low standard. I will never take another class with this prof. Lesson learned.",0
"This class was super fascinating and Dr. Fox is very knowledgable and makes the class very interesting. He talks without bias and explains abstract concepts simply. That being said, this class is also very difficult. The exams are very difficult worth so much of your grade and he assigns so many readings. You need to put in the work to get an A.",1
"Sam is amazing. If you are a music major, you will see him plenty as the Double Bass Professor. Every Wayland resident loves him. He is kind of awkward, but it's really okay, he is so passionate, caring, and very funny when you get him to open up. Make sure you appreciate this man to infinity. (I have never taken his class, I just know him personal",1
"Tough grader. Grade is based off of 2 papers (of books you read), midterm paper, final paper, and participation/attendance.",0
"He is a great prof, but you can tell he is better at teaching in a lecture hall with 9 chalkboards rather than online. But as long as you do past midterms you will be fine.",1
He is an absolute awful professor. He will give you grades based on how well he likes you. Don't make yourself known to him. Sucking up to him is a must. Brown nose as much as possible. His grading is not fair and even if you are right and argue he will not do anything about it.,0
Don't take her! Oh and tell her to get off of twitter,0
Horrible teacher. she made me want to drop out of college entirely. She lowered my self esteem and I felt very uneasy around her. TAKE KATHY SOHN!!!,0
"I took her accounting for non financial majors as a requirement and she was AWFUL. She is rude when she posts on the announcements, she makes it seem like a burden to answer questions and grade homework. She is unbelievably unorganized. She doesn't even know when her own assignments are due, then gets mad when asking for clarification. DO NOT TAKE.",0
Dr. Merrill is the most amazing lecturer I've ever had. He is so incredibly interesting and makes you want to come to class. I never missed a lesson because I was always wanting to hear what he had to say. The tests are easy for a medium grade. To pull an A you've got to work hard though. Only 2 papers and 3 tests.,1
Do not take this professor! Such a pointless class you find yourself wasting your time. Ketchum tells you drifts irrelevant and drags class on. Impossible to stay awake. Worst professor I've had so far.,0
"Dr. Ferretti was one of the most understanding and caring professors I have ever had. Enjoyed going to his class and he showed great videos! Class isn't mandatory, but tests are straight from the lectures with a few questions from the book. Course is 3 exams, 2 papers, and extra credit opportunities. Exams are easy if you study! 10/10 recommend!",1
You want to teach a course to a pharmacist without teaching about treatments? Don't.,0
"Very nice guy. Loves to talk. However, that is not always a good thing. He tends to ramble about irrelevant topics, but makes attendance mandatory although it would otherwise be easy to pass  by only showing up on test days. Tests are relatively easy, pretty easy grader. Just terribly boring.",0
"A nice guy but not a great professor. Exams were hard, not enough time, made up 85% of grade, you needed to remember EVERY topic he taught in class. His bad microphone made lectures hard to listen to. Idk the other Econ 302 professors, he was good not great. Dropped lowest midterm grade, HW was easy. He was nice to give a 1% curve at semester end.",0
"I call this guy ""Dr. Skull"" because when I made a bad grammar error he once drew a litle skull and crossbones on my paper. Seriously though, THIS GUY HAS MADE ME A PERFECT WRITER, the A I got from his class was the hardest grade I have ever made. He will fine tune your writing to pefection. TAKE THIS PROF!!!!!",1
He'll put you to sleep. Easy A bc you correct your papers as many times to get a better grade. Class is not worth going to.,0
Great professor for history. Clear with what she wants you to learn. She gives you exactly what is on the test before hand and reviews it offering extra credit. There was 4 primary source papers that she grades really easy. ,1
"Horrible professor. He rushes through the material and hardly explains the logic behind what he's talking about. Most of the people in my class were lost even on the basic, introductory stuff he explained it so bad. He is also extremely rude and very grumpy and acts like he could care less about helping his students.",0
His lectures are basically stories and life advice. The papers were easy and fun. Tests weren't super easy but not too difficult.,1
"Before I took this class, I heard that there is a major term paper. However, the research techniques and practical writing knowledge gained in his class is valuable if youre planning on going beyond just undergrad. This is the class where you learn to write real college papers that will get you into and through grad school.",1
"Make sure you attend lectures. Try and do good on all material before the final, hard final.",1
"Professor Doyle is a really great teacher. Not only did I learn a lot from her, but she's really laid back and funny in class, which made me want to come to class. A lot of writing involved, but hey, it's a writing class! I found that she graded pretty easily, as long as you took the time to write the papers.",1
it's okay..,1
This guy barely teaches the material. Instead he prefers to rant about the most irrelevant topics (such as black on black crime rates) and forces you to agree with him. His writing is incredibly sloppy and he constantly rushes. For someone who claims to be an expert in game theory I have yet to see him display any expertise in the field.,0
"He is an extremely harsh grader, gives unclear instructions, and penalizes you if your work doesn't reflect his personal preferences. I took the class when we first started using Zoom, and still received my worst grade. Heartless & apathetic. Get's a power trip over his ability to give students poor grades. It's sad he doesn't want you to succeed.",0
"seem like a kind guy, but if you are in the waiting list, you can drop it now and take another course. because he won't allow the waiting list",0
"Chem 42. She was very passionate about teaching, and chemistry. Excellent at explaining what needed to be done, is understanding, and cares about her student's grades. Overall great teacher.",1
"Prof Plantinga was my favorite this semester. He only lectures, so attending class is important unless you have a buddy. He really cares about his students. Even though I struggled in this class, he could tell I cared about the material and was trying my best so he gave me a better grade than I expected. 100% recommend for REL 131.",1
"Professor Julie Head was a pretty solid teacher. Class is pretty exam heavy so you have to really put in the work for each and every exam. For exams, redo all the packet exercises, connect problems, discussion assignments, and the textbook because she will take some odd questions from it. Overall, you will need to put in a lot of work for an A.",1
Pointless activities and assignments. Would make you do hours of projects and papers for no points and then the assignment after all of these activities were only worth like ten points.  Expected you to know the information.  Didn't really teach you.,0
"God the testing format is horrible, power point style,2-3 minutes per slide/question m, spelling counts! And the information your tested over is hella specific jeez",0
Very hard to understant do to her accent.  Class was taught at a graduate level over our heads.  Did not like answering questions.,0
"She's a fine professor. She allowed me to join the class late, so that was nice of her. Overall an easy class and a very nice lady. She does give an essay question on her final and she didn't go over that very much in class, but it wasn't that bad. If you need to take an English class, Professor Freed is a good choice.",1
I really don't like his class. Too much work for an introductory-level class. The final Essary requires you to find your own objects from 3000BC -1600AD (you need to secure the object when you are only halfway in the class). There are huge problems with the teaching style and hard to communicate. Doesn't care about his student. For online courses.,0
Reisinger is the best French prof I've ever had. She's a hard grader but is always willing to help and tries to make class interesting. She gets to know her students and is friendly.,1
This would be an awesome class if the professor was the one who graded the exams. Instead we're forced to go through the excruciating pain of getting random points taken off since the GSIs grade extremely picky. I officially hate Ancient Rome and never want to take any class that has anything to do with Rome.,1
I hated this class I wish I dropped it.,0
"17 questions essays to read and 30 words from glossary to know for each exam, and he takes only 3 questions essays and 5 from the glossary. Very hard!",0
Honestly the best professor at CCC. She was the only professor who didn't disappear during the pandemic by assigning discussion boards or essays every week. She held Zoom classes where we could keep learning like we did on campus. She also held Zoom office hours where you could talk about anything. She helped me remain sane. Thank you Dr. J.,1
"Science is not my strong skill at all, but I found myself to excel in this class with Bradley. He understands that some of the material is hard and he is very willing to help you anyway. He hosts review sessions before major tests and made cookies for those who came. He also offers extra credit for random things which is nice. 10/10 stars!",1
"Really, really awful professor. He's intelligent, but not at all helpful, and doesn't really want to make things helpful.",0
"This man changed my life. If you listen to what he says, and take upper division classes, you learn so much because the people there are genuinely interested. Do the papers, and get them in on time, or you could fail. Yes, it's possible. I was a major, so I took most classes, and my husband and I still use the notes from them, 4 years later. <3",1
"Very helpful, friendly, pleasant, highly recommended overall.",1
I had her for multiple child development classes. I wish she taught all of them! My favorite teacher I have had at Fullerton. She really cares for her students. I enjoyed how she would take roll and ask a question. She makes sure everyone is involved and works together.,1
"Please save yourself the trouble of taking this teacher. He is very disorganized, lost my essay the last day of class, made me buy an online tutor program which we didn't use, and grades very harshly. He teaches only through powerpoint and is not very good at it. I learned nothing in this class.",0
"Extremely knowledgable, but also extremely unorganized. She jumps all over her slide presentation, and speaks as she thinks, making it very difficult to take notes!",1
"Very helpful when you ask questions and makes sure you know exactly what to do.  the exam is online which is a big bonus because you can write it at home ina much less stressful environment.  If you're prepared to do your work and stay up to date with the material I recommend this prof...if not, find someone else.",1
he is an ok lecturer. smart and knows his history and all but the lectures can be dry at times.,0
VERY GOOD,1
I don't know how he's gotten so many good reviews. Hands down one of the worst professors I've ever had.  Completely misled that it could be done with no previous knowledge. Embarrasses you if you dont know the material yet he'll only show you how things should be without backing it up with why. Only likes or helps those who already know A LOT,0
"Extremely disappointed and upset with Cyntha's teaching/behaviour this term. Questions on tests are misleading, marking schemes are strict, and do not follow the nature of the question asked. Rude on class forums, over email, and in person. Extremely unprofessional, and makes people feel degraded with how sarcastic, unhelpful, and mean she is.",0
Exceptionally student centred,1
"Boring lectures, attendace not mandatory. 1 page paper on fringe benefits. 1 midterm and final. No homework. Curves heavy. Skipped a lot of classes, never read the book and got a C. Will review a lot for midterm and final. Not a bad professor, but VERY boring lectures.",0
"Super easy course. I took it online and it took about 30 mins on Sunday night before the 1 discussion question per week was due. Literally easier than any 7th grade class. No HW and you learn absolutely nothing. However, it counts as credit.",0
"Plesha knows his stuff but really couldn't care less about his students. Class is not curved, even when the average is a 60%. Discussion is mandatory because there's always a quiz, but otherwise completely useless- they teach things that aren't relevant to the actual class. Expect to teach yourself how to do most things.",0
Dr. Shiller is fair and a very caring person if you are the type of student to show EFFORT. Participation is big for him. His exams are 85% Multiple choice with a few essay questions. His exams are definitely over the power point he provides. Make sure you do your LABS!!!,1
"Mr Romero is the best math teacher I've ever had! He's really easy going, easy to understand, and cares for his students; he makes sure you really understand the material. If you struggle in math like I did, take Romero, he'll help you SO much. There's not THAT much homework, but always group classwork (which is helpful), and a few quizzes/tests.",1
"Knows the material and very willing to help you during office hours. Friendly as well, but don't go in on the first day sitting in the back of the classroom! He is far too quiet for the size of room this class was in, and his lectures seem to be mainly based on ppt with sample problems. Entire course grade consisted of exams and quizzes; HW was 0%.",1
"Doesn't teach, course is useless and artificially made difficult by him by not posting reference material / lectures online. Truly one of the worst. Possible conflict of interest as well since he seems to work for IBM.",0
"Prof. Smith is warm, dedicated, and a great facilitator of discussion. The workshop format she uses in this class is really fun and a great way to practice giving and receiving feedback. I highly recommend taking ""Short Fiction"" with her.",1
"He's awesome. He's a really passionate and interesting storyteller, and you'll learn a heck of a lot from his class. The study guides are godsends, and you know exactly what he expects.",1
In order to pass this class you have to show up and do the work its as simple as that. Professor Lamers made the class interesting for me I would definitely recommend taking his class. ,1
I had a hard time relating to Dr Cozzens.,0
Professor Romero is the most helpful professor I have ever had in college. If you need help with anything in her class or just with Spanish in general she is always available and willing to help.,1
"Awesome Teacher! We got actual time in the studio so we could get our hands on the actual equipment. By the end of the class I knew how to use all the cameras, audio, VTR, etc! It is hard to get an A on your productions but he gives great feedback so you can improve.",1
She is very  disrespectful and very unprofessional and unorganized .,0
"I enjoyed the subject and the fact that the class was discussion and not lecture based. Not much reading but there are quizzes every week and attendance is VERY mandatory. He does not give out a lot of papers, only a midterm and final as well as small email hw assignments.",1
"Kelm was one of the best Spanish professors I've taken from. I found the assignments clearly planned and understood what was expected of us. He gave concise and funny lectures and I always felt like he wanted us to do the best we can. He was very receptive to questions. Grade comes from online homework and chapter tests, no cumulative final.",1
"Do every SimBio, it's essentially free points. The first test is a breeze but you need to study hard for tests 2 and 3. He gives extra credit. Test questions are worded really poorly so you need to fight for every point back that you can. Lectures are long and boring but pay more attention to what he says rather than the slides. Overall a nice guy.",1
One of the worst professors I've had in my academic year. He doesn't explain the course material well and usually bounces between conversations. I do not recommend having this professor at all!!,0
Not too challenging of the class. Easy to participate in.  Keep up with the readings - all which are not that hard nor is there a lot of pages each reading.,1
Professor Seibles is an amazing professor a published poet and awesome teacher. He gets down to our level he understands were students love to share his poem with the class no tests just weekly reading which is fairly easy. Had three assignments very forgiving lets you rewrite mid term. Gives great feedback and enjoyable class I highly recommend.,1
"Dr. Hall is sensational! A true gem. She studied under Professor Ferber at GW and it shows. Her knowlege, style and appearance are all top rated. If you have issues with her, you may want to reconsider your choice of schools.",1
"This was an online class with Prof Ingham.  He was very organized, and there was a lot of work but you can easily get it done in 1 or 2 nights.  There is a paper, and quiz every week.  You definitely need to read the book, but otherwise you will do well in the class.  He is quick to get back to you with grades and email.   Would take him again.",1
"He Grades hard, Boring class",0
"This is the worst class you will have to take in your engineering career at UB. The subject could actually be interesting but Chung is terrible at lecturing. I've learned more in the follow up lab MAE 385, which is a 1 credit course, than I did with Chung's entire course. There's a quiz every lecture because previously no one attended lecture.",0
"The class was extremely easy, but I did not like the format. He gives zero feedback on assignments. The labs are terrible and shouldn't even count as labs. There is also no guidelines for the midterm and final; everything is testable, and it is a lot of material. If you need an easy A, this is your class. Don't take it expecting to learn much.",0
"great prof, very clear lectures, straightforward final. tells bad jokes at least once a lecture but his delivery always makes them quite funny.",1
Professor Lhota is literally the best professor I have encountered in my entire life. I have never met a nicer person before. She's really sweet and care for the students. She gives really good feedback on the papers. There is no pressure in the class if you do the work. Take her help if you are stuck. The class is not easy but she makes it easy.,1
HE WANTS YOU TO SUCCEED. By far my fav professor on campus. He teaches exactly what will be on the test and his book goes along with everything. If he doesnt go over it it wont be on the exam. Hes goofy and can get sidetracked in the best way. He is accessible 24/7 in his office hours and is willing to go over hours extra to help you learn,1
DONT TAKE THIS CLASS. for a freshman seminar class she grades extremely hard and unless you simply regurgitate her ideas back to her you won't do well. She has certain ideas about papers and if yours dont match you won't do well. Again- take another class.,0
"I am writing this in retrospect from graduating several years ago, however, looking back I thought I enjoyed my time with this tough professor but he really is small-minded and insensitive.  I think he thinks he is brilliant, but he really is just a very Catholic person spitting a lot of nonsense and insensitive to those with other belief systems.",0
"When you take Honors 210 do yourself a favor and do not take White's & Ritzenhoff's section. Before, this class was only taught by Ritzenhoff, which everyone said was fun. This was the first year with White & she was awful. Gives no assignment guidelines, not available for help with assignments, and then has audacity to tell you not to worry Awful",0
Great Teacher and very helpful,1
Kate is a very nice and laid back teacher! She is as helpful as she can be although a little disorganized. Go to class and do all the projects and its an easy A!,1
"First and foremost, do NOT take this class online. This subject is far too difficult for an online course. Dr. Seifert is a brilliant, but the way the class is structured is just designed to be as hard as possible. Also he is very slow to reply to emails and doesn't seem to want to put too much effort in. Sadly he is the only one for this class.",0
"Nice guy and the class isnt bad if he doesnt mark your paper. The TAs are easy markers but hes super tough. Will also never answer your emails which is why I wont take one of his classes again. Spoke to him many times about going over my harshly marked essay, he said hed look over it again and get back to me but never did and ignored all my emails",0
"The way he explains things in lecture is confusing.  But tests are easy, and test material is directly from the power points and in-class problems.  Overall, I recommend him.",1
The man is very high on himself. Very pretentious and thinks he's funny when he's not.,0
"By far the funniest professor I have ever had. His class is enjoyable, but make sure you pay attention. He will notice, and he will not like you if you don't. The midterm was a little difficult, it's not what you would expect, but if you go in for help, you can do  really well in the class.",1
"Awful teacher. Extremely vague. Says there's no right or wrong way to do an assignment, but when you turn one in, it's not what she wanted. Never gives back papers until you've turned in more assignments with the same mistakes as before since no feedback was provided. Totally ruined my love for writing. Also extremely self absorbed.",0
"Seriously the best professor you will find. He's incredibly insightful, helpful, will spend time with you 1-on-1, and always gives not only great, but accurate and productive advice. You will learn to draw and design extremely well. A real-world kind of guy, don't listen to anybody who says otherwise. Take him, work hard, and you'll be awesome. A+",1
Shes a great yoga teacher who cares so much about her students.,1
"His instructions are not clear and sometimes disccusions are graded pretty harshly, overall it's an easy class",0
"I thought this class was really interesting.He has alot of energy for this subject, and he is a nice guy in and out of class. i took it pass/ no pass (that was a mistake) i would have gotten a B+ and i did not do much work and skipped the project.Nice guy, approachable, and attendance not mandatory.Lectures online",1
"10 online quizzes, 20 questions in 10 minutes... if you have a problem with one of the questions, email and explain and he will give points back.  Lecture videos are very dull and the book is easy, but the quizzes sometimes have information not from chapters.  Overall, mixed feelings on him and his class.",1
"Tests are all multiple choice, and very confusing. He is a great lecturer though, very interesting, and knowledgeable.    The final exam is optional, and replaces one of the 3 term tests.  plus a paper.  My final exam was lost!!! we had to work out a grade.    ",0
"By far, she is the most warm and welcoming professor I've had in college. She provides great feedback and excellent story telling when it comes to lectures. I couldn't imagine taking psychology classes with anyone else.",1
Everett is a fantastic teacher. Knows what he's talking about and is great at clarifying things. Tests are a little difficult and done times weirded strangely.,1
"Would not recommend taking BIO 303 with Professor Kageyama. He uses powerpoint slides, but doesn't follow them, making his lectures hard to follow. He knows a lot about genetics, but not how to teach it. The tests are cumulative, so the final had 100 questions and tested on EVERYTHING. There are five very easy projects and 5-15 points extra credit.",1
Easy class! Do extra credit and you will get an A. Grade point booster if you need it.,1
If you have the availability to take this class online I highly recommend it. This class was one of the most frustrating classes I have ever taken. The professors dosen't count attendance as a grade but takes points off if you aren't there. He has a really snappy attitude and expects you to lead the lecture along with him. Worst class ever.,0
Hes a kool dood boi!!,0
"Dr. Stevens is the most unorganized professor I have ever had. His notes are very scattered and hard to decipher half of the time. He is very hard to get ahold of, and most of the time will not respond to emails. Also, he can go on and on about one topic in lecture and on the exam the topics will be completely different. You have to teach yourself.",0
Super funny and loved his class but hated the way he had us take notes! He would read them as if he was reading a story and would go fast. Other than that no complaints at all!,1
"Dr. Gaitros is a good teacher. You will get an A if you go to every class including recitation. You do not need to know anything about coding before. He will teach you. He gives out lots of code in class, which is nice. As a person he is not super nice... Often times he seemed to not want to be there and was somewhat disengaged.",1
"This professor is horrible. Does not make time for students, has no grading criteria, rather just reads your hard work and give you a random grade based upon her mood at the moment",0
"I took him last fall 2012 for my English 98, and my experienced with him as my professor was great. He is very knowledgeable. He seems like a walking dictionary as he knows everything about english world. He doesn't require us  to buy book as he makes his own book for us to use the entire semester. I have extremely learned English because of him.",1
"Her lectures had nothing to do with the assignments. The assignments, on average, took 8 hours to complete. Also, her advice for when struggling with labs and assignments is to ""look back at your notes.""",0
"This guy is the nicest, most dedicated professor I've ever met at McGill. He's patient, attentive to students, and truly loves teaching. The course requires some work and the grading isn't the easiest, but it's really all been worth it. I also recommend for students who want to go to law school.",1
"Imagine having Regina George as your lab coordinator and that should give you a pretty idea of what Rashmi is like. She tries to sounds nice in her written communication, but it reeks of fakeness. The amount of work required absolutely ridiculous considering that the lab component is only worth 20%.",0
"Professor Davis was my first Political Science professor, and he remains my favorite. Class is mandatory, however the lectures are mostly either basic topics or discussion. The discussions are well done and he encourages students to offer their own opinions and debate as long as you are respectful. He doesnt assign any papers and exams are easy.",1
"the content is easy and ripped directly from the homework assignments so studying is easy however, by the time we got to the final we only had our midterm mark and he had not marked all 7 assignments worth 15 percent of our grade. This means its anyone's guess what your mark will be until you get it",0
"Dr. Brown is one of the worst professors NC State has to offer. His lectures are absolutely useless in which he emphasizes stuff that does not matter I would extend a whole semester than to take a class with him again If you are unfortunate enough to take him, I would suggest treating the class as an online class and learn the concept from YouTube.",0
"DMD is a fantastic professor! She not only encourages you to do your best, she expects it. Even if you don't like poetry or don't know anything about it, you will learn to love and appreciate it with her as a professor. She is so entertaining and really creates a fun and close-knit class. Definitely take her if you have the opportunity!",1
I took a course that was taught by professor Sinha and two other professors and her part of the course was the most confusing and least informative. I can see her efforts but I honestly did not think it worked out in the end and a lot of people I know struggled through the course because of her.,0
"It can take him a little bit to get started on a lecture at the beginning of class and he tends to exhaust each topic so you dont always get to cover everything and usually have extra information to learn on your own but what he does cover he covers well. Grade comes from attendance, clicker ?s, and tests, but there is extra credit with each unit.",1
It's a challenging class! make yourself study for it!,1
Extremely unclear instructions. Way too much work.,0
"Very surprised this professor has a 4.0 rating. Basically your entire grade is based on two exams. There are no power points so everything you learn in this class is self taught. With that said, there is more reading for this class than I have ever had in any other class. I have a 3.8 gpa and I might fail this class. Seriously do not take her class",0
"Hope you enjoy reading because that's most of the class. The quizzes take up the entire hour she gives you, with some feeling like you need more time. Look at the chapter objectives before reading to get an idea what may be on the quiz. She is extremely harsh when she grades the group project. She expects things on there you won't know she wants.",0
AVOID!!! If you can take someone else- do it! Thank goodness I took AP Econ in high school or I would have failed. Everyone in that class was constantly lost. He ranted about politics and how rich he was all the time. The quizzes never made sense and he often got his own answers wrong. He would walk out of class for no reason and then assign a quiz,0
"Horrible prof, doesnt give any feedback and his lectures are god awful. It sucks that hes the only option.",0
Act involved in class + choose easily dialogue for the final project and youll pass easy.,1
Kimoto was cool. She is very energetic and likes to talk about her son but it's cool. Tests are online and open note/book. But timed so do the study guides. They help. If u have her early in the morning she'll keep you awake. Just get to class and take notes. and use a lot of detail on tests and assignments,1
underground poker legend,1
"Very poor grader - She doesn't have a real rubric to go by. She takes off many points for miniscule things. There are four assignments in the whole class with one discussion each week. You have 3-4 days to post, not the typical full week. She takes weeks to a month to answer emails and grade assignments. She is very unhelpful.",0
Dr. Comfot is from the Chemical Engineering department. So his entire class is geared toward Chem E's. If you are another kind of Engineer you will not to well in his class at all. I highly recommend a different teacher if you are not a Chem E.,0
Read the text book chapters at least 2 times and you might pass.,0
"She was really easy to listen to and always responded to questions in an efficient manner. Online the class was taught through the textbook so be prepared for two chapters weekly. If you can manage your time wisely, it was easy to get everything done. Students posted meaningful discussions and were easy to engage with. Overall an interesting class.",1
Extremely enthusiastic professor. Teaches Humn1 in a different way and encourages class participation. Fair grades. He gives you a review sheet for each test which are extremely fair. If you read the assigned reading you will do fine. I am not a particularly great reader or writer and I think his tests and quizzes were only slightly challenging.,1
"He definitely thinks he's ""all that."" Don't bother asking questions, he'll just talk at you until you're begging for mercy. Rather cold personality for a professor.",0
Exams didn't reflect lecutures and southern drawl was a killer,0
Motivated and smart instructor,1
For 109 he's the best. Actually cares about what you are doing. Even tho it was online he tried getting people to participate. All you have to do it do the lecture examples alongside him and you're good. The assignments were not hard. The test and exam have stuff from the textbook so make sure you review it. Overall a great prof.,1
"Most unclear prof ever, lectures are interesting but they have nothing to do with the course. make sure you read the text book and have a good group for the project",0
Brandeen is one of the best teacher at Humber. She teaches some of the hardest subjects on the course but she does an incredible job at explaining them. She has her expectations on students but is also very understanding of extraordinary situations. Don't think twice before taking her as a teacher.,1
"FYI, I took AITA 213, not 301. Alright, saddle your boot straps, kids. This professor has caused the worst stress all semester. Her lectures involve her saying that everybody should participate, yet she berates everybody who does attempt to debate. Her tests are a large pile of awfulness and she assists you 0% of the time. DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS",0
Tons of busy work for homework. Not very understanding about late work. Boring class activities,0
"Dr. Rivas is a great professor! Although there are a lot of dry and lengthy readings, they are all ver applicable to our education and writing. As a future teacher I found this class very useful, even though I was constantly reminded not to talk about teaching and discuss my own writing. He only assigned three essays, a blog, and a final. ",1
"Had this guy in two different classes, and I did bad in both. His does this thing where he goes from statement to question that makes you lose interest in hearing him speak, but you need to listen if you want to pass. You also have to read the chapters, take lots of notes, and do all the problems if you want to do well. 3Cr class with 9Cr workload.",0
"Very easy going, but that could be bad if you are not able to keep up with material.  Good lectures but poor in practice.  Regardless, I was able to learn a lot in a short amount of time.",0
She is an awesome teacher and makes the class interesting and eases nerves for the students who are nervous giving speeches.,1
laugh at his stories and jokes and you'll get an A,0
"Great teacher, very sweet and outgoing. Makes math easy. Explains very well and offers to help outside of class. Expect homework. Would recommend to everyone. Gives great math examples and has clear grading outlines, but is an easy grader. I would take her class again!",1
I definitely recommend this prof to anyone that isn't sure about APA format. Dr. Dingman assigns weekly homework assignments but they are all goaded towards the final research paper. Easy A is you do all of the work. She's very understanding and helpful.,1
"Smart guy with well planned lectures. Makes an effort to put something meaningful into his course content. If you pay attention and keep an open mind, you'll actually learn something from him. If you're just there to sleep through lectures and cram the exam, stay home.",1
"Zweifel is a great guy, but his plant science class was super hard.  A lot of things covered on the test didn't really seem to come from the notes. I studied for every single test in there (and not just the night before) and I ended up with a 53% in the class. I even went to SI's and to talk to him for help. He didn't do the best job of explaining.",1
"Get ready to put up $$ for his book and access code in order to do the homework. Class is based on 100 points. If you like organization, do NOT take this class. Canvas is just flooded with all kinds of documents and he constantly goes off topic during lectures. Does offer a good amount of extra credit. Likes to hear himself talk.",0
"She is by far one of my favorite professors that I have had at GVSU. She does make you work for your grade but as long as you come to class prepared and have a genuine interest in the language and culture, you will succeed.",1
"Requires textbook & syllabus every day. Must follow course agenda to bring correct papers to class, if you don't you have to go print them. Gets very upset if you don't do any of these things and lectures over the rules in the syllabus. Treats you like you're in middle school.",0
SÃºper essay class just got to do the work,1
HIST 424 changed my life!  The genuine passion of Dr. Tone quickly connected our class creating a unique open space and honest space to approach carefully selected fascinating subjects. Dr. Tone is incredibly knowledgeable and conveys extraordinary compassion towards her students.  It was such a privilege to take this class!,1
Kind and personable professor however RIDICULOUSLY tough on essay marking for lower-division PoliSci courses; as if you're a Master's student. Gives no detailed criteria for marking. Spare your GPA the unnecessary hit and AVOID,1
Made this French III class harder than it needed to be in terms of us adding to previously gained knowledge. She could take more time in explaining grammar. But she was okay in general. Going from Mme Vitaglione in French 2 to her was more difficult than it should have been if the point was to have people leave being fluent in French.,0
He is very lecture heavy and moves WAY too fast during his lectures. You're better off learning the material on your own because he explains stuff in the worst ways.,0
"She definitely taught Eng 116 at some point because I had her freshman year for it.  In addition to the other negative things already said, she took suggestions I made to her privately about articles for class and claimed in class the next day to have come up with a list (which matched the one i gave her) herself.  Late, slow, emotional,dishonest",0
Without a doubt the best teacher I have had in my entire life.  It is obvious that Dr. Sprinkle legitimately cares for his students and will do anything he can to help them not only in class but in life.  Don't pass up an opportunity to take his class.,1
Andre was a very thorough professor. He clearly explained the data and which steps to take for SPSS. Also held office hours to go over or explain sections of the paper one might not understand. The first assignment was extremely easy. You just need to make sure you go to class to follow the instructions precisely. Or you won't do well on it.,0
"I had a three hour class with him, and he did NOT lecture at all. He'd ask questions, tell us we were wrong, then tell us exactly what we just said...? What? He lectured TWICE in the semester and it was great, but he totally left you alone with the book. He quizzed us on things that DID happen in the Civil War, problem is... it wasn't in the book.",0
"Dr. Newman refuses to lecture for her students.  It is infuriating when she asks for feedback on her teaching and says, ""do not write down to lecture more because I will not do it.""  Every class you read some paper of Cystic Fibrosis from 30 years ago.  That is about the whole class.  You split into groups for most of the class and talk about CF.",0
Very knowledgeable professor. He knows his stuff. Only problem is that he goes too fast when showing his slides. His exams are half the quiz and half class notes. Very hard class. Must be willing to memorize a lot of information.,0
"Professor Rose is so great! He breaks anatomy down by chapters, so theres is a test every week, but this makes it much easier to study and do well on each test. Attendance helps if you go but doesn't hurt too much if you don't. He's super sweet and wants to help you do well!!!",1
Whole class is based on the premise of four papers. There is a complete lack of structure. She goes on tirades about useless material that has no value. Arguably the worst professor that IU has to offer,0
"Nice guyinteresting character at times. Passionate about his class. Throws chairs. A tough grader. Doesn't give clear feedback. I felt like I didn't improve as a writer at all. In order to do well, PARTICIPATE. Go to office hours and email him! If you show you care, you'll do better. Laugh at all his jokes even if they're absurd and not funny.",0
"This class is super easy. But this professor is the horrible at explaining the content. He is a super nice guy, really caring and cool, just sucks at explaining math. I taught myself how to do everything in this course.",0
"Professor Cox is extremely knowledgeable in her field. Her modules are clearly organized and some of the assignments were actually quite fun/interesting. Professor Cox makes it easy to grasp ideas, concepts, theories, etc. She truly wants students to succeed. I would highly recommend her. Not a hard class at all.",1
"This class can be easy, if the professor was a bit more in depth with the material. The syllabus is very vague so it's hard to know exactly what to cover, and taking any of the exams are a mess. But if you are on top of things it can be done.",0
"Great professor. If you're looking for a career in the sports industry and have any questions, you can go to her and shell give you the answer most of the time. Overall this class was fun and taught me a lot about what it takes to be a professional in the sports industry.",1
"he takes marks off of every grammar mistake that you make. He basically only likes you if you show up to class, miss a class he announces it in-front of the entire class and embarrasses you. Even for quizzes he takes marks off for dumb stuf. he's aight when it comes to funny catch him outside before class after his office hours he won't even look u",0
"Honestly, I hated her class. Shes a touch grader. Shes not understanding & wont even answer any of your questions in class.. She wants you to show up to her office hours even if you dont have the time to or she wont pass you period. All her feedback on my papers said youre not critically thinking & would leave it at that. Avoid at all cost",0
By all means she shows she is very knowledgable of her subject but she is not friendly at all. It seems like she teaches just because she has to.,0
"it is hard to understand her lectures, however her quizzes are super easy and help your grade. the exams consist of a lot of studying from the book since her lectures aren't the best. its doable, you just have to work for it. she's a nice lady and would respond to my emails. offers extra credit. final is online , I recommend her if you're not lazy",1
"Mary Callaway is a legend. She teaches by asking questions and encouraging you to come up with meaningful and well informed answers. She runs an engaging and relaxed classroom, and her assignments are geared toward your freedom. For example, a good chunk of the grade comes from writing 8 micro essays, but you have dozens of options to choose from.",1
Best professor of my first semester. Exam was such a nice break because he made it very easy.,1
"Wang, has a lot to offer as a teacher, but implements all of them terribly.  Lectures are boring, and the teachers and TAs dont help at all.",0
"it was a dark and rainy day and i was down on my luck and i was asked to have a meeting with this person ""Yeaman"". upon my arriving to her small cubicle she began to  belittled and tease me about my low GPA. this all took place in her cubicle and then i left the college shortly after her full frontal attack on my emotions.",0
"Such a sweetheart and says lots of funny stuff. Her class is test heavy but she is not trying to trick you, go back over your HW problems and you will do great. She is always willing to help, and will spend an entire class answering questions is she has to. Highly recommend, I actually found her class to be more fun than I thought it would be.",1
"Dr. Swansinger is more interested in seeing if students are making connections to what she's teaching (fair) than giving opportunities to get a good grade in the course. This makes for cool class discussions if you're paying attention and participating, but it also means you only get 3-5 actual grades. If you don't like talking in class, avoid.",1
"Even though I have previous calculus experience, it all left my brain the second rogers started talking. Think you know how to do something? Think again!! Good luck getting 10/10 on anything because he will always find one little thing to dock off. Tests? 8 pages at least and does not relate to any of the problems that we did in class. Good luck!!!",0
He is hilarious. He will show you the real world challenges.,1
"I LOVE Dr. Schreiber, she is not an easy A, but she works with you and is very nice! She talks to her students and explains their grades, GREAT communication. She is one of my favorite teachers by far, I suggest taking her.",1
"Knowledgable, organized, and competent in his field, but extremely arrogant and unhelpful, which outweighs all the positives and makes his classes a drag. Do not be fooled my his friendly demeanor in class. In actuality, Pearson is as nerdy and introverted as it gets, which many students find out by the time it's too late to drop.",0
"Mike Branch is a terrific teacher. He is clear with his expectations and makes his classes engaging. It is not an easy A, but the more important thing is that your writing will improve because he is very helpful and thorough with his comments.",1
This was one of my least favorite classes. Classes were long and boring (even though they were just 50 minutes long). She was helpful if you needed it. She was pretty lenient about when things were due which is nice. I put minimal effort into this class and got a decent grade.,0
Very personable and fun professor,1
"She is a very exciting teacher! You will not fall alseep in her class! Tests are hard and tricky so study, study,study! Going to the SI's will help tremendously!  She will challenge you, but you will learn.",1
"If you want to talk about religion and politics, take his class. Tests are worth 100% of your grade and there are only four of them, including the final. Good Luck!",0
"calc 2. I see many like him but I had a horrible experience. He grades extremely harshly for an already hard class, and he explained things poorly. He also didn't allow graphing calculators and made us do everything by hand, so a lot of long tediuous work unrelated the material, then you lose big points even if you learn what youre supposed to",0
"He knows his stuff but doesn't have enough language to explain. Strong accent. You can get easy 10 on workshops, but he is very picky about word use on quizzes. Use more word ""object"". Be ready for stupid jokes.",0
"This professor is adorable, and really funny. There was a lot of reading for each class, and he uses slides and would put them online before class. He shows a lot of good movie clips. Only 3 tests all semester and they were all multiple choice. There was a lot of material to cover, but it was an interesting class.",1
"If you take this class be prepared to drop it in the time allowed before the W. William  is arrogant and rude. He wishes he was at teaching at Harvard but apparently he's not THAT GOOD . His lectures were a waste of time and had nothing to do with the tests. How he still teaches at SRJC is beyond me, I guess no one else wants the job.",0
Not the easiest class but a with a little hard work you can do really well,1
"The class was easy, made some friends but learnt nothing.  feel that I could have gained more from the calss but  this teacher did not teach the material. At all. Just spoke on random tangents and did not teach. Do not take JRN 202 with this teacher.",0
Ms. Shade is a very good science teacher who cares about what she does. Lots of labs that are never difficult. She was very chill the whole semester and answered any question that was asked.,1
Professor Grunlund knows her work but she makes this subject too hard! Every quiz she gives is timed too! She dont even give you a second chance to take it over like most teachers. Shes also not truthful about whats going to be on the test. She will tell you to study stuff thats going to be on the test but it dont be on it. Kind of deceiving.,0
"He is an egotistical, senile, walking contradiction. AVOID IF POSSIBLE - don't ask him for feedback because he will contradict himself on a weekly basis. Never disagree with him or ever let him feel like you may know something he doesn't - he likes to feel power over students so agree with him and just show up the final day for the presentation.",0
"Dr. Buchoff is by far the worst professor I have ever taken at UCF. She grades very harshly but does not give clear expectations in class. Every time I asked her a question she had an attitude and just told me to go read the textbook. She requires few assignments but they are each weighted heavily. Her lectures are pointless, I learned nothing.",0
"Really tough grader. It's difficult to get an A in here. Really study the exercise packets before each lab period and try to do well on the reading quizzes. There's a lot of activity packed into a 2 hour period. He will help you if you ask, but sometimes answers questions like you should already know the answer.",0
I thought this class was an easy A until her exams. She makes up her own questions so they're impossible to understand. lectures are easy though.,1
This professors rude attitude and dull approach to teaching is astronomical. Easily the worst course I have ever taken with probably the most inexperienced professor. Classroom discussions are nothing less than hostile. Beware from this course and avoid this prof at all costs.,0
"Engelhardt knows his stuff. If you participate in class, it'll help your odds. However, you NEED to study a lot to do well on exams. (6-8 hours for a typical exam is fair for his class). His practice exams will take you by surprise compared to the actual exams. So ask questions, and you might just be successful. Exams have HUGE curves (10-20%).",0
"The worst professor that I have had at SFU so far. He is condescending and makes no sense most of the time. When I would go up to him to ask him a question, he would put his face really close to mine and say ""look into my eyes"" and make me feel incredibly uncomfortable before responding. AVOID THIS PROFESSOR AT ALL COSTS.",0
Excellent Professor! Take good notes and really listen to what he says and you are guaranteed a good grade! One of my favorite professors at the University!,1
"The lectures are all but required in order to pass. There are frequent pop quizzes, and only two tests. The class is hard but Dr. Palmer is really nice.",1
"Dr King is hands down the worst professor I've ever had. His grading was unclear, his feedback unhelpful. Weekly quizzes online only open Friday-Sunday, and papers that didn't seem to have clear grading criteria. Every time I went to his office hours he was not there and took his time responding to emails.",0
Very fair grader. Hard to get ahold of.,1
"Man, this class is a lot of work. Not for 'sports majors' like myself. Close to an hour's worth of homework a night. If you go to class everyday he'll raise your grade one higher. I had a C+ going into the final exam, but bombed it and my final was a D+. Exam is harder than the open note exams (most answers are online). I wouldn't recommend him.",0
Statistics with Professor Ramasesh might have been my least favorite class I have ever taken. He is not understanding NOR does he help you in the slightest bit. It is almost like he enjoys making fun of students for asking questions. He never made it clear what to study. The ONLY thing I learned from his class was what hair product not to use.,0
Professor Bommer is unprofessional. Some of his questions on his exams do not even make sense. I remember asked him a question and he did not even know the answer. He wrote the book that is used in class and there are so many mistakes in book. Mostly everyone in my class would get low grades on his exams. Do not take his class.,0
"If you want someone to teach you Spanish right, then he is the person to learn it from.  His dedication and passion for teaching erases the barrier that comes with learning a foreign language. Not only does he teach you Spanish, but also very intriguing facts that are loosely tied in. So you literally will become smarter by taking a class with him",1
"Yes, he is very boring!  However, a lot of the work you do in class can be used for your portfolio and (if he ever returns anything to you) he is brilliant at editing and revising!  I didn't do so hot on the quizzes, but I still got an A in the class.  Stick it out.",1
I really liked this prof. I had her for social psych and juvenile delinquency. In both classes we had three tests and an optional final and quizzes every week. Plus a research paper in both classes. Her grading on papers is extremely unfair but I still made an A in both courses. Her lectures were great and very interesting. I would recommend her.,1
"PICK ANOTHER TEACHER FOR THIS CLASS!!! I took this my freshman year and was so overwhelmed by her lack of organization and difficult tests. I'm confused why there are mixed reviews on this teacher but I guess it goes to show how she CLEARLY picks favorites (so unprofessional). I wish I could give her a high score, but I really hated this class.",0
"Pretty good guy, knows his stuff well, and his notes are so excellent. If you attend all his lectures and note down every hint he gives you, you will know what is on his exams, he is very fair in that sense. If you skip class, you will pay for it.",1
Every class period was the same and he never seemed enthused about teaching us the material. I was eager to learn about International Economics but having such a disheartening teacher made me resent the course. He's a nice guy but if you want to learn do not take his course(s).,0
"You either love or you hate him. His class is memorization based- there is no history without dates. Papers must match his views to the T or you don't get a good grade. Lets just say, I'd never take another class with him.",0
"This is a beginners level Anth class, but he expects you to be an anthologist before taking the class. He gives you a short period of time to complete quizzes. There's essays for the class and he expects you not to use the book for these. You need to literally make it up in your brain. His wife probably divorced him, that why he's so bitter! Run!!",0
"Dr. Braun is amazing and a valuable asset to the University of Akron.  She is witty and funny and an expert in her field.  Expect a lot of reading, but class is structured to be part lecture and part discussion and she really does listen to what you have to say and expands on anything you find interesting.  She is a fair grader and gives feedback.",1
"I think John did a pretty good job teaching the course material. His course notes could use a revision though. His midterm was on the easier side, but final was a killer. I still thought, I did really well on it, but as it turned out, I didn't. Wondering what the class average for the course is.",1
"Madhu has specific unspoken criteria for assignments, even when you follow the syllabus she always finds ways to deduct points. Unlike other ECE profs, she does not accept missing assignments at the end of the semester, and you will get a zero for them. If you are having hardships in your personal life she isn't super compassionate or accommodating",0
If you want a good teacher period don't take her. She is not helpful at all. Her test suck because its all over lecture and somethings she does not review. When it comes to grading papers it doesn't make any sense her grades she gives. She also lives in the 40's so be prepared to not learn anything beneficial to todays world. ,0
"took dr hernandez for cal 2 online last fall. i took this course twice before with others and failed. met with dr. hernandez in his office for help with class and that helped a lot! also emailed with problems i couldnt do and he replied quick with help. points in discussions and extra credit in exams helped too! I passed with B finally, thanks!",1
"I LOVE Wendell! She expects a lot from you but she's the kind of teacher where you don't want to let her down. Her instructions are clear, she is understanding, and the projects are great. Just keep on top of the work and reading and you won't feel too overwhelmed by the end of the semester.",1
"He doesn't give extra credit, even if you are failing. You ABSOLUTELY have to show your work on his tests or he marks the question wrong even if you got the right answer. You cannot use a graphing calculator only scientific. He goes through lessons really fast so if you aren't good at math, this is a difficult class. I had to drop his class.",0
Where do I begin Mr. Hak is my role model. I hope to be a crown prosecutor one day and Mr. Hak only strengthened my love for the subject. He is a wonderful interesting man who gives you his full attention when he speaks to you. He is kind and respectful to everyone. Very sweet and humble teacher. I wish there were more classes to take with Mr. Hak.,1
"Hard class, but very interesting",0
"She is probably the worst professor I ever had. The problem is not her skills teaching, but how she behaves outside of the classroom, she does not understand that life happens and schedules/ plans may need to change. She is not flexible at all and if you have a problem, good luck she will tell you that everyone deals with the same thing and nothelp",0
"Dr. Littlefield is very smart, and I enjoyed talking with him in person.  He is not that effective at running a grad seminar, grading papers, returning papers, or returning email.  ",0
"No tests are nice but the man is so boring. I had to force myself to go to class. There are 3 essays, a small presentation and a research paper. Its a lot of work for a gen ed. That being said he always lets you revise your work and resubmit. I have no excuse for not getting an A+. Bring a pillow if you do take him",0
HORRIBLE TEACHER!,0
"I had Jerry for a majority of my law classes at SUNY Broome. He is hands down one of my favorite professors. There are not a lot of tests or homework. However, we did have multiple group projects- don't worry if that is not your thing, they were easy! And he gives you the option to do them alone. Would take another class! I will miss him next semes",1
"""SIGH"" (then stares at your soul...) This is the result you will receive when you ask a question in class. She does not know much other than the material""SIGH"" Yea she will do that in mid lecture/sentence multiples time every class. Every ""SIGH"" reinforces my idea that she had an epiphany and realized she's in the wrong profession. Still made an A.",0
"He may know his stuff, but he's a very unapproachable man. He expects you to know everything as soon as he teaches it, and if you aren't 'at his level' then he doesn't even look at you twice. DO NOT take evolution with him, it's awful. Passionate, maybe, hard core, for sure! - I am also an  A student, and had to work my butt off just to pass. yuck",0
"Would definitely recommend, one of the best English teachers I've ever had! He's super helpful and has great lectures. I learned a lot!",1
Awesome Guy. Just make sure you show up for class. I never used my book once.,1
"You are able to study something you are passionate about, but get ready to do busy work. There are two papers due for each chapter of the textbook you read plus a quiz. On top of the busy work, you're also supposed to be working on a research paper throughout the class that's only eight weeks long. Hardest class in the program.",1
"I took stats 146 from McNabb summer qtr., hes an excellent teacher, has some great tricks to keep you focused and engaged during class. Extra credit was offered on a handful of occasions. He teaches out of the book, but puts the material in his own words, making everything much easier to comprehend. Highly recommended teacher!",1
Best class I've every taken. Phil teaches more about how to succeed in life than anything else. He wants classes to be interesting & about learning important life skills like negotiating & lie detection. Grading is entirely quizzes that are verbatim from the board. Study the board hard & you'll pass.,1
Tammy is such a sweet and fun teacher! Attendance was mandatory but the classes were fun and easy. Tests were done in groups and there were assignments due Tuesdays and Thursdays based on the chapters that were discussed in class groups but they were the same 5 questions. ,1
Pretty clear professor and his tests are not too hard as long as you study all of the recommended problems. I would recommend  doing CLAS and going to math drop-in.,1
A to the WESOME. His class is not a <i>class</i> his class is a place to chill! Relax and you wont notice that you actually learn something out of this class!,1
"Hardest grader ever. There are 6 exams for the whole semester, I studied for at least 4 hours for each and barely pulled a B on each. He makes you take test twice once individually and once with a group. If you have to take MGT 101 don't take this professor!",0
"Avoid this professor. His lectures are fast and not clear. His exams are very difficult. He writes his own HW problems, and does not use the textbook.",0
"Very nice man, very brutal exams and assignments. Worked my ass off and pulled a B. On a side note, he never changes his clothes and smells absolutely terrible.",0
Im sure she knows alot about this subject but is not a good teacher.  I found the syllabus to be scattered and unoraganized beyond comprehension and a very poor and unequal grading policy.  She may be great in a setting with clear goals and expectations but in this course she failed at doing any of the above.,0
"She has an intimidating air about her but was always more than willing to answer questions. Very understanding and didn't expect perfection from new nursing students. Would point out little mistakes, but only to provide feedback so we knew our weak points. would definitely taker her again",1
"He seems to be a very nice man outside of the classroom, but once in class he is incredibly condescending. He does not listen to his students needs. His comments on papers often left students feeling embarrassed and upset. I went to office hours with him but left feeling worse about my paper. Honestly one of my worst experiences with a professor.",0
"I have never, in my life, taken a course I didn't actually learn anything in: until now.  She is extremely misinformed in the world of healthcare.  Of all the non-truths she told our class the best one was that everyone should buy their own malpractice insurance because employers don't provide it.  WHAT? Ultimately - she's just pompous.",0
"Avoid this professor at all possible costs - not only will you learn nothing, but you will have no fun in the process.",0
"For PSY 400 he almost never lectures and lets you work on your group project every day in class. He is helpful, but he often changes his mind about what he wants and expects from your project. He is a tough grader on the presentation and paper. Overall, he is a nice guy, easy to talk to, and is pretty funny.",1
If my grade doesn't improve I will be forced to drop the class by the deadline. His only office hours are an hour before class. He doesn't provide an email or return voice messages. He goes off on tangents about world history instead of teaching English. His instruction is unclear then he rips my papers apart. I don't know what he wants. ,0
"Although I technically had the grade for an A, I received a B due to his rule that you HAVE to make an 86% on final regardless of your overall grade to make an A. His lectures are not relevant whatsoever, usually just rants... However, you have to go because you have to sign in for points. WORST CLASS EVER. Good luck, bio majors... you'll need it!",0
She does not give you much time for homework and quizzes and they are worth a big chunk of your grade. Assigns a lot of work and does not grade it. Not recommended.,0
"He's a really nice guy and knows his subject well. It's a hybrid class, he'll explain the concept and do some questions in class. Need to study on your own before class or else you'll have no idea what he's talking about. Bad news is there'll be a quiz every week (he curves grade tho). Quiz will be pre announced. Get ready to learn math yourself.",1
"Most difficult class. Lecture/lab did not mirror each other. No way to prepare for lab. Lab assignments provided with NO lecture. Not enough time to compete lab, failing grades. Study mineral/rocks or you will fail all quizzes. Go to office hours, study samples, force professor Irwin to answer questions. RATE her at end semester with school.",0
"Get ready to read 100-300 pages a week depending on the books he chooses to assign. After reading you have to write a one page paper on a topic he chooses. Might be the worst class I have taken at UD,If you are a full time student and don't have/want to dedicate the time to read an entire book every week, don't take this class Also not 2nd writing",0
NOPE. Don't do it.,0
I took chemistry in high school so having that basic understanding of concepts definitely helped me get an A in the class. It can be very difficult for some people and very easy for others. Trina is a tough grader on written answers because she wants to make sure you really know what you're talking about. She can help you with wording if you ask.,1
Hes overall a very good professor hes a little hard but he will work with you and do your homework and you will succeed in his class. Hes a hilarious person and makes the class very entertaining.,1
"The guy is awesome.  He is hilarious, caring, patient, and smarter than most of us realize.  I loved his class.",1
"I really enjoyed Sarah as a professor. Ive always liked history so the class was enjoyable to me. If you are taking this as an easy A, I would reconsider. Not horribly difficult but she is very particular with how she likes her information presented. The class is all lecture and the tests are long and lecture intensive.",1
"His pre calc class was horrific. He goes so fast during the lectures that you can barely keep up. He skips so many steps that you can't ever really tell how he got to the answer. Even if you do well on a quiz or test, be prepared to get a terrible grade, since he will deduct points if you don't show every little ounce of work on that paper. Awful.",0
Waldman is absolutely insane. At times this can be fun and at times it can be infuriating. DO NOT take this class unless you are required to. If you are required then make sure to get good TA's becaue they do all the grading and they can translate Waldman's babbles for you.,0
Worst professor ever. No one should ever take him. Couldn't teach to save his life. He doesn't even know how to use the technology at hand ie basic computer or projector. Only teaches for him to understand and no one else. Avoid like the plague. If you have no choice get outside help asap.,0
"I think that the class was just great.  There is clearly a method to the ""madness"" as it got people talking and encouraged free discussion and thought.  Overall a very different, stimulating, fair, and creative class. (Plus the Prof. is extremely hot!)",1
"Dr. Panning is a genuinely kind, caring and gifted professor. I decided to take her class on a whim Fall '15 and it was the best decision I've made in years. She cares about participation and requires that everyone contribute. As a result technology is banned, but this helps to foster more engaging classroom discussion. Highly recommended prof.",1
"She would be great for high school.
 
 PS her name is spelled Miiller.",0
"Mr. Peters is phenomenal! He really cares about his students and wants every student to get an A. Class is completely discussion based and if you do the reading you'll be fine. The only assignments are a writing exercise each week that has some reading, 1 essay, 1 multimedia project, and 1 research paper, no final. Peters is excellent!",1
Loved her!,1
Easily the worst Professor I have had at WCU. I taught myself everything by reading the textbook because his lectures were nothing like the tests. He isnt helpful outside of class and even made a student cry. Im just thankful I passed the class but I would not recommend anyone to take him ever.,0
Very subjective grader.  Must Avoid!!!,0
"Very meh.  Definitely not compelling, but he is fair and generally pleasant in the classroom.  Very surprised to see another review call him organized, I thought the contrary, he seemed pretty scattered at times.  Doesn't exhibit a great deal of follow through on things he promises to the class.  For those taking 607, easy class, which is a plus.",0
"We never had an essay assignment and there were extra credit opportunities. The tests were tough but as long as you payed attention during class you did fine. The textbook was used a lot, we had weekly readings but it wasn't ""mandatory"" even though she told we should read it. Overall I liked the class a lot, and definitely would  recommend it. ",1
"He is a nice professor overall, but he is not a great teacher. He is hard to understand and his tests are very difficult. I believe that the average grade for tests was a D.",0
"Prof Papaccio a fair grader and encourages critical, creative thinking.  Her remarks on papers are extremely helpful, and she is a very friendly woman and an extremely approachable teacher, willing to answer any questions students might have.",1
"Not a fan of professor Sikora whatsoever, terrible lecturer, not easily accessible, taught myself the whole course the textbook. However, his tests are a joke so I guess that helps.",0
"Tough grader, way too much reading. rude, obnoxious and very opinionated . Only her opinion matters in class and she will let you know that right way. Take her courses if you want to be miserable.",0
"He was awful, the class is so boring, he has minimal notes on the screen during lectures, I studied for 11 hours for his exams to get C's. Office hours are so inconvenient and he has no interest in helping, do not take this class with him.",0
"This course was absolutely dreadful. The professor was completely unorganized, he was absolutely useless in helping you to prepare for tests (he'd say what was on the test and it would be completely different). He read from power points the entire class and the book was awful.  Avoid this course with Dr. Mabis, although there really isn't a choice.",0
"i can hands down say this guy is the worst. hes SO RUDE. refused to work with students despite covid. (would put obscure questions on exams on things ONLY discussed in class. if you missed, even because of covid, he REFUSED to help.) i did the reading. i put in the work. he is the dictator of his class (his words). avoid if you want a high GPA.",0
"Just an awful experience. People are right, you do learn a lot. But it was definitely the most stressed I have ever been.",1
Prof was okay. She's never at her office hrs though. Class was interesting but the TA who does the grading is an ass (will kaufman).  Who counts #of incorrect comma usages and deducts it from your grade?  It's not even an english class!  Isn't content more important than a few grammatical errors?,0
"Professor Ding is a very critical grader. If you want a decent grade, I highly recommend having him review your paper at least twice before you submit your final draft, and if you can, find a classmate who is willing to peer-review for you as well. He's extremely particular, so read and re-read instructions and be VERY careful!",0
"She is a little bit of a space cadet at times. She is interesting though and she assigns interesting reading and is helpful. But she has enough experience that she's not afraid to call people out for not doing the reading. It's always funny, as long as it isn't you.",1
"Hey, lets put this guy in charge of the honors program so he can make the smart kids fulfill a ridiculous range of random requirements instead of concentrating on their major!",0
"His lectures are based off of slides, which aren't the best to learn from due to them being blobs of text. He goes way too fast as well, sometimes skipping topics or barely explaining them. I think people are better off learning from the book. Homework doesn't seem to help much on exams.",0
"Nice prof, really sweet, but her teaching style is so boring, in fact the whole course is really broing - I'm ready to switch majors after this.",0
"I think he's really sweet and caring, he tries to teach you as much as possible but really you could sleep in his class. He's totally fine but i just didn't learn anything in his class and passed regardless. I love him though and i wouldn't mind taking him again, 2 critiques & 1 experimental report & 1 take home final. He's nice though! you'll pass",1
She is a very nice woman. I really enjoyed her class because she made me comfortable for my first year of college. Her grading is very lenient and she is very understanding towards her students. Her class is an easy A and I would definitely take again!,1
Took her soci 102 class online and it was a lot of work keeping up with assignments but other than this was a REALLY simple class. Easy essays and assignments. She wasn't really helpful since we never met but she is quick with answering emails. I recommend taking this class to boost your gpa and if you actually want to have fun writing essays.,0
"Tom seems like a nice guy at first, but then you quickly come to realize the mundane nature of his lectures. A typical day in class alternates between lulling you to sleep and painfully awkward. The tests consist of 5 essays that will be picked apart to the bone. There are much better courses to take to get the most from your money.",0
He''s a really nice guy and very understanding if you have a legitimate reason for missing class. He is a very tough grader though. Also the papers he assigns have nothing to do with his lectures which are basically hour-long tangents. I didn''t learn much from his class. ,0
You'd think that a course on Spanish film would be fun but this was just the opposite. It was obvious that the prof thought that he could wing it without preparing. He'd come into class and say whatever came to mind or he'd just ask for our impressions. The result was that we learned nothing but almost everone got an A anyway.,0
"Best psych professor I've ever had, you won't find anyone better. He's extremely helpful, knowledgable, kind and passionate about what he does. Obviously nothing in life is handed to you on a silver platter.. so study! However he does his best to reduce the amount of work a regular boring old teacher will give. What more could you ask for?",1
"Took this class online during summer semester, which consisted of 3 tests. He understands that most of the people in the course are not graduate accounting students so his primary concern seemed to be that you, as an mba student, understands the basics.  I would definitely recommend him to anyone.",1
"Jim was an awesome instructor. The class was not easy, but he made me dig down deep, define my mission, and really give some serious thought into my management experience. The good, the bad, and the ugly. Most importantly, my relationship with Jim continues to this day, and I am not alone.  If he is listed-make sure you sign up for his section.",1
"Awesome feedback.  Took the course online in the MHIT program, couldn't have asked for a better experience.",1
"not the greatest prof, if you work hard you will get a good grade.  You have to pay attention in class no skipping or sleeping.  A lot of work but if you have the time, then hes alrite",0
"She could teach well, but chooses to push people around instead. She is very happy that she is married to the president and uses that on people",0
"Unless you are a favored student, this class will ruin your life. Professor refuses to assist struggling students both in and out of class. Will mark you wrong for getting the correct answer because he doesnt like how you did it, yet wont help you do it his way. AVOID",0
"She cannot teach whatsoever, graded super hard and when asked for grading rubric she responded that the mark was out of 5. Would actually put effort in each forum post and would be marked oddly (3.2/5, 2.7/5, ect.). Was excited for this class, but her grading and unclear modules ruined the whole subject for me.",0
"This class is very well structured and Van Horn is very good about following the syllabus. That being said, theres very little teaching or explaining being done and he doesn't answer questions very well, most of it is interpretational reading on your part. LOTS of group work so get ready to work in a group of people just as confused as you are.",0
"Dr. Leathers is amazing! Very funny, does a lot of helpful demonstrations, and is really funny. Go to his office hours!! Nicest guy. Even if you're not a science person, this is an easy breadth requirement with a lab.",1
Prof. Nochera's instructions for everything were incredibly unclear. She doesn't really know how to run a class. The exams covered no material that was learned in class and when you'd email her about it she'd have a lackluster response that never answered your questions. I would not recommend taking her ever.,0
"Very cool teacher. He is funny and always willing to help. Book is completely unneeded, don't waste your money, just go to class and take notes and you will get A's on all the tests. Tests are straight from lecture and almost exactly the as practice tests. Just go to lecture, read notes, take practice test and the extra credit never hurts.",1
"He always complained about our class's integration skills. He assured me since I aced the 3rd midterm I'd pass the final, but then put gotcha questions and exception to the rule questions on the final. Doesn't not help you work to keep any scholarships, etc. Aced MATH 106, 107, & 208 with ease, but his teaching style hinders any chance at an A.",0
"Prof Hanks is great. Very knowledgable, clear and helpfull. Readings were very interesting and has some amazing experience when it comes to Maya people and the region. Sweet professor, very kind. His main GSI was weird, got to teach few last classes. Very selfcentered and loves the attention, but not a good lecturer.HANKS RULES",1
"95% of the information required to write the papers he requires must be found out of your own, unguided research. He spends long periods of classes on a single myth, or plays a long video that is sparse with pertinent information. What your grade comes down to is how infallible (by his standards) is your fatiguing amount of independent research.",0
This class was really easy. Just go to class and you'll be fine. If you don't go to class just copy the notes from someone and you should still be fine.,1
"Extremely rude (condescending) to students. I've had plenty of bad teachers, but her level of disrespect is far above any other. She reads off slides created by a TA & HW that is way beyond the scope of the course. Exams are long and confusing. Only thing she cares about are her stories (football talk) during the 1st 30mins. Don't take if possible.",0
"Tough grader? More like bad test maker! The lectures were pretty much a waste of time. Assignments are about the only thing where you will learn stuff in this course. The exam questions are ""list the 5 principles of ___"" or ""what are cones and rods?"". That's the kind of exams you will be getting, so be prepared to memorize every word on the slides!",0
"Tons of work, some of it unnecessary.  Still, Joyce seems nice and tries to make himself available to his students.  Lacks classroom experiance, but still has some good ideas and makes this required class as interesting and useful as possible.",1
"Uuuummmm...I was really excited about this class until I took it. Mr. Knocke was really informative and helpful but was sooooo redundant and slightly annoying (for me). He talked & talked during studio time and it drove me nuts. He even talked the whole time during our final project!!! I cannot work when someone is talking! btw, easy class.",1
"Wouldn't take his class again, lectures aren't clear, not good at concise power points and can barely read his handwriting on the board. I like to think he means well, but honestly comes across as pretty cold. Exams are also confusing and expects you to know way too much.",0
"Don was pretty intimidating at first, but he's a really nice guy. He's really quick witted and he makes a concerted effort to learn about his students. I took personal finance with him. The material wasn't particularly difficult, but I found the midterms to be hard because they're very detail heavy. Tough marker but his expectations are clear.",1
Awful class. Will most likely have to retake this. Quizzes are very nit picky. Papers are graded not too harshly but wrote movie critiques not even based on plot more about production. Exams are all essays so dont take if youre not a good writer. Never posts on blackboard. Hardly discussed book in class but must read for quizzes and exams,0
"These reviews are an unfair depiction of Dr. Hahn. He is an incredibly intelligent man. If you're willing to pay attention and put in the work, you'll learn a wealth of information from this class. Dr. Hahn KNOWS what he's talking about. He expects his students to behave professionally. If you need help, he will be the first person to help you.",1
"Had Dr. Palacios before she became a permanent part of the department. She reads off her notes which shows she does not know her material, her test was so hard everyone failed so she added a bonus essay. She seems sweet but she is boring in class and her textbook is sooooooo dry. AVOID.",0
"Great prof, sure the material isn't the simplest ever but he makes it interesting, funny and engaging. Very approachable and helpful and super-friendly. Would take any class if I knew it was taught by him.",1
"Johnny is amazing, I would highly recommend taking him for any classes that are offered! You can tell that he genuinely cares and wants his students to be engaged. I'm not a big fan of Econ but he really tries hard to make it a class you will enjoy.",1
"If you put effort into the assignments and read all the material, you will do well in Prof. Lawrence's classes. Since I took an online class I didn't have much interaction with him, but his comments were always helpful. In general, it's frustrating that BYU makes contacting your prof directly virtually impossible, but that's the school's fault.",1
"Really doesn't care about teaching the course whatsoever. Told our class that half of us may become good engineers and the others would be outright bad ones. Doesn't really read emails for questions, instead responds with rude comments on how we should know certain things that he either hasn't explained yet or explained poorly in class.",0
Best professor I have ever had. Knew so much about all of her students even if you never talked to her.,1
"She was very helpful. Took some time to grade things, but she was very thorough. There was some technical issues which didn't help her. She was very caring, understanding and always available to answer questions.",1
Not helpful at all goes through problems easist way possible not good poor way if teaching would not take again,0
"ACC 255 was nice, friendly and easy. Professor lets you know your weaknesses and strengths. The main work is about your resume. He really wants you to help in getting your first job, prepare a strong and quality resume. Every class was interesting and I enjoyed it. Wish him all the best, he is a very good person.",1
"Mark is a wonderful teacher. I don't think he goes too fast, but maybe that's because I actually pay attention in class. His board writing is crystal clear, and very organized. I barely had to read the book because the notes were just as helpful. Pro-tip for this class: write down EVERYTHING he puts on the board, pictures and all.",1
if you are taking pre cal with him I suggest taking another teacher his tests are unnecessarily hard and teaching style is terrible. doesnt matter if you know it because the test will be harder.,0
"This lecturer holds his students to high and unclear standard concerning their written responses. The reading material assigned is unnecessary and inapplicable to the poorly organized lectures. The test at the end of the semester was universally failed, the study guide particularly misleading.",0
"Awesome professor, one of the best in Collin College, lectures and the powerpoints cover the exams",1
"Caplan is the best! The material is captivating and interesting. Graded only on 3 exams and there are a few questions straight from the textbook that aren't covered in class, so be sure to read it. It's an easy A if you pay attention, read, apply the material, and study! He does course capture, but I liked attending live. Also, get the coursepack!",1
"Legitimate the worst teacher I've ever had. Im currently sitting in class, I can't understand a thing through his accent, and when I can understand it he doesn't explain anything he does he just does it.",0
This professor was nothing but a nightmare. Professor Gilbert not only seemingly never graded a thing but didn't abide by her own syllabus. I would advise against ever taking one of her classes- especially her online classes.,0
"Awesome professor. She truly wants everyone to succeed and she deeply cares about the material she is teaching. If you are scared to take accounting, take professor Hulsey!",1
"Very helpful & nice, intends to really further your writing skills and help you as a student",1
"He is very smart so he seems unapproachable, but once I went to see him one on one he was a lot easier to talk to and as questions. It isn't an easy course or lab and the material can be dry but the lab portion really does help if you put the effort into it.",1
"You can barely understand a word he is saying. His slideshows and notes aren't clear and don't make any sense at all, just a couple of words thrown together. DOES NOT give out reviews and will not answer questions about what will be on the test. HORRIBLE TEACHER. don't take unless you want to barely pass or even fail.",0
"Class should be called Grammar for Education Majors. Was excited about the class but grossly disappointed. There were several days I (not an Ed major) could have skipped without missing a thing. Is pretty easygoing, but does not prepare you at all for the retardedly hard final. Her random ear-piercing laugh is like torture. Easily annoyed? Avoid he",0
I found this class quite confusing. The lectures never seemed to match with the tests and seemed to be mostly a distraction from the subject matter. A vocabulary lists words and definitions that are surprising since most are never addressed in class.The links to Wikipedia prove especially annoying since I'm not paying to have Wikipedia teach me.,0
Worst teacher I have ever had the displeasure of having.  All of his tests are super hard and the final was unlike anything we'd ever seen during his class.  (The average was a 65).    Even though he's a really bad teacher there is an amazing curve that he gives.  I ended up with failing grades on all my tests except one which was a D and got a C-.,0
he a very hard person to understand sometimes but he is very smart and willing to work with you to understand everything if you give him the time and effort he requests during class time,1
"I enjoyed this class so much! Zambrano is a master teacher, a great guy, and he can really shed light on the language. He's a real pro. That said, study and don't slack if you want to make an A--The final is 25% of your grade. I'd still take him again anytime!",1
"These classes are mostly lectures. He is very funny, but he is a little strange and he tends to be very blunt about things, which I personally find refreshing. He uses online resources, so you don't have to buy a textbook, but he does want you to buy a clicker. If you show up to class late, or you're on your phone or talking he will call you out.",1
"RUDE to students, clinical staff open about how much they dont like her!",0
Super organized and inspirational!,1
Awesome prof.  Has a plethora of real world knowledge that she incorporates into her lectures. Keeps lectures to the point and offers real world examples.,1
"Professor Zein is a very tough grader. And most of these things said are true. Her desired answers are subjective and she is picky in her answers. However, she is very clear and precise in what she expects. If you listen carefully, and take notes you will do good. Pass this class and you can pass any F&M class.",1
By far the worst class I have ever taken. He made it way harder than it needed to be. It was a 100 level class but treated like a 300 level class with unrealistic reading assignments every night. He does not go over any of the reading in class but you will be tested on it. If you are not a PLS major  DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS.,0
late marker. had to self learn course.,0
"Only 6 assignments: 4 discussions and 2 papers. She is a harsh grader, but prompts can be vague. Each assignment has a different book associated with it and she gives 2 weeks per discussion and 3 per paper. DO NOT PROCRASTINATE! You will struggle if you wait until the last minute to do your readings. Some summaries can be found online but not all.",0
"just show up and do your work , overall is such a great professor and really wants you to succeed .He has a great sense of humor too , mess around with him in class , he'll like ya.",1
"Doc barely covers what he puts on his tests and has students use Wikipedia instead of a textbook. While in his office, he thanked me for asking dumb questions, asked if there was something wrong with me such as a mental health issue, and when I told him I was withdrawing he said that it was for the best. I studied 20+ hours a week for his class.",0
"Not very clear on her directions, seems to not know a whole lot about the labs, and she gives different students different answers for the same questions asked. VERY stingy about sig. figs and digits of precision. Make sure you show up to every class and do your pre-labs. She was very nice but didn't seem confident in teaching the class.",0
"She does not provide study guides. She is always late to class but requires her students to always come to class and be on time. She lectures to us as if we have a degree in Biology already. Every time you ask a question her response is 'Well, what does the book say?"". She is a nice lady but a HORRIBLE professor. Please do not take her seriously.",0
great teacher; provides timely and thoughful feedback,1
One of the worst teachers I had.  Doesn't explain much in class.  I wouldn't recommend him to anyone,0
"I've only been in class for 1 week so far and if it wasn't for all the extra help from Tim Sether, I would of failed misserably.  He's responded to my daily emais; even within the hour.  He's also called me at home to walk me assgs. This is one instructor who really cares about his students success!  Highly recmmended to take one of his classes.",1
"I was lucky that the majority of the class was online. She ""taught"" in class but all of the homework, quizzes and tests were online. I only went to class once a week because we had a lab. If it were't for the class being online I would have failed miserably. I do not recommend her unless you want to teach yourself.",0
"He does not use blackboard so you never know what your grade is. We also had only 4 assignments the entire semester- two ten page papers, a four page paper, and our final exam. Very tough grader and a lot of reading. The entire class was way over my head. ",0
"Absolutely legendary prof. He really cares about his students and it shows through his teachings. Hands down the best teacher at uWindsor. He really understands the content and makes you understand just as well. While his course takes effort, it is absolutely worth and he makes it really enjoyable.",1
she is absolutely a bad women in the world....wants to fail everybody with teaching nothing.........idiot!!!!,0
I gave him a good review earlier but now that I am in 122 I see that he did not do the subject justice. I am completely unprepared for this class and its only the first week. Please take a better teacher if you need to go on in chemistry. 121 is the foundation for the rest and I feel totally lost thanks to the poor teaching of professor Heske.,0
"Great class! would definetely take again, she video records her lectures which is so helpful if you missed a class or just need to study for an exam.",1
"Very good teacher. If you read, watch the lectures, and participate you will pass.",1
Please ..,0
Dr Franks was a great choice for Italian Cinema. She lived there and told us many stories about the people and customs. Discussion was definitely lively both during and after the screenings. There were many short assignments so you get a chance to improve your grade.,1
Need to speek english better,0
"I would not be able to survive math without the help of this amazing gem. I took her last semester and passed with flying colors due to her excellent teaching, and this semester she continued to help me for free because she cared about my success. Absolute angel, and would 1000% recommend for anyone looking for the perfect math teacher.",1
"She is a very nice lady who cares about her students. But she is the worst professor. She is BEYOND disorganized & gets so sidetracked to the point where we don't finish the chapter & we have to learn the rest through her ""online lectures."" Her exams consist of MC & ""short answers"" that are 4 pages long and some aren't even on the study guide!!",0
"The first day of class he was like 15 minutes late. He walked in wearing a knitted baby blue sweater and a scowl on his face. He stopped and then said, ""What, you'd look like this too if your wife made YOU wear this sweater. He was my favorite after that. Awesome professor-he made class interesting and fun.",1
He is the man. plain and simple. Lectures are basically just stories about his life as an Attorney which puts what he is teaching you into real life scenerios. Funny guy and I actually looked forward to going to his class. Barley keeps you the whole time also.,1
"Old school prof. While I don't mind an old school prof, and everyone teaches differently, this man reeked of pompous arrogance. His class was him ensuring everyone realized his importance. 50% midterm on an Econ elective to a fourth year class, and a rude class-wide email responding to the low average. 8000 word essay. Needs to check ego at door!",0
"professor Robinson is something. He is overworked, underpaid, and understaffed. He tries to teach, but he just goes over formulas in class not HW. Tests are online in his labs and you need a 80 to pass on each in order to take the next test. He doesn't ask any questions and gives just about no help. If you just do  HW and study, you'll get a B",0
Alright professor but reads off the slides which makes the class seem a lot longer then it is. ,0
"Barnum is great. He's super funny, but if you're one of those people that are easily offended find someone else or another course to take. We gave each other crap all the time, he acts more like your friend not your teacher. I hate art but he's been my favorite professor so far, he understands that most of his students aren't art majors.",1
I would not suggest taking this class with Lawrence Martin. His lectures are extremely boring and the slides that he goes over during the lecture have nothing to do with the exams.,0
COO-KOO! Nuf' said.,0
"I would not recomend anyone to take her class. She always cancelled class. She graded all our work in like one day, right before grades were due. She's not difficult, her work is manageable but she isn't clear with instruction , I turned everything in and somehow I got a D? I surely don't understand her grading system.",0
"It is IMpossible to get an A in Bagbyâs courses!! The only way you will get an A- in his course is if you are psychic, a genius, can brownnose REALLY WELL (you should go on and get your ass-kissing lips ready), or unless you are kin to Bagby!",0
"Prof Armstrong is a very passionate individual and I admire his enthusiasm towards teaching econ. His semester is organized very well, but be prepared to do plenty of independent study as he expects you to know more than you probably do. His midterm/final are very hard, but the curve WILL SAVE YOU, DONT GIVE UP. My midtermwas curved from a %50->%86",1
"Dr Lierberman is a very spiteful and miserable human being. One of the most disrespectful and rude professors I have ever met. The TAs run the entire lab and she only comes out of her office to be mean to students. On top of her awful character, she pressures students into breaking university COVID guidelines in order to come to lab. 0/10.",0
"Well, what can I say. Things started out well, but then he became an arbitrary grader who assigned grades depending on whether he liked you or not. Initially he had said the class grade on translations depended on quality, and not quantity (meaning attendance). He seems to have forgotten that.",0
"Prof. Tripp is a great person and a GREAT professor. All of the bad ratings are people who probably do not try in the slightest because I found his class to be stimulating and not that hard if you just do the work. Yes, there is a lot of reading, but he gives out work that is very interesting (HST 103) and he is always willing to help.",1
"Great as an advisor, horrendous as a professor.  No rhyme or reason to the grades.  He goes ""waves his hands"" and tells you to figure it out on your own.  He will help if you ask AND can find him.  Honestly he doesn't teach a thing in the lecture periods.",0
"Hope you can teach yourself Excel and Access. No lectures, no notes, no discussions, grading: lots of issues with items on quizzes and the case studies (heavy points!) that were not covered in the textbook. I had to email the instructor weekly or more (not something I would do in any other class ever).",0
Mrs. Parker is a very good teacher. She understands that people have lots to do and is willing to help out in any way she can. She would talk me thru the math problems and I understand them better. she is always there. if you put the effort in that you want to learn she will help you pass this class. Thank you,1
Worst teacher I have EVER taken. Test have nothing to do with what you study. If you think you can study homework and pass a test you a mistaken. Any test is completely different from any hw you will be doing . He never uses canvas . Don't I repeat DO NOT take this horrible teacher.,0
HATE! I absolutely hate math to begin with and he made me hate it a lot more. Very hard to understand with his accent. This is probably the most difficult class I've had. He is very discouraging and always tells us that if we do not understand we might as well drop the class. Awful professor. Would not recommend.,0
"She is a good teacher, but getting a good grade in the class if you are not a good test taker is impossible. She has 3 50 question exams and drops the lowest. There are also 6 quizzes (Also lowest dropped) and a final for a total of 1,000 points. Do not take her if you are not a good test taker!!!",1
"The exams can be tough given half of it is recall with pictures asking you to name a feature. He always has review sessions before the exam so take full advantage because he gives you a road map of the exam. Show up, do all the extra credit, and turn in your maps early. They take time so don't procrastinate on them. Dane is a very nice man!",1
He is one of the best profs i've ever had! He is always willing to help you or clarify things if your stuck!,1
"I've never written a review but I have to for him. He is by far the worst professor I've ever had. Rude, doesn't help students, and consistently insults and makes you feel terrible if you don't know the answer. He said that if you need help to ask questions and when you do he insults you and tells you that you aren't studying enough. Don't take! ",0
He's incredible!,1
horribly boring professor. not helpful.,0
"The only thing you need is the access code, didn't use the textbook. Attendance is not mandatory. I only went to class for a month and stopped. Everything is online aka, assignments and exams. If you go to class the day before and exam she'll tell you what's on the exam There is a research paper but it's for participation. Easy A. Would take again.",0
"Straight Up Awesoem Dude, made learning fun!!!",1
Class is relatively easy as long as you attend. He has the greatest ability to get off topic and talk about the completely wrong thing. Sometimes it was interesting but most times it was dull. ,1
She's a good professor who gives good feedback and is accessible outside class. She prefers to be notified if you won't be showing up to class. There is a lot of homework and writing to do but that's because its an english course.,1
"Do the work and you can get an a, don't and don't expect to do well. Not that bad of a professor considering the material of the course is suppose to be difficult.",1
Probably one of the most entertaining professors I've ever had.  This guy actually manages to make accounting somewhat interesting.  Very humorous and respectful.  I would definitely recommend him.,1
"Lecture is incredibly boring, she talks to the ceiling most of the time... literally looking up at the ceiling. But her power points are chock full of information, study those and you'll do just fine. She does take attendance via signing a paper sheet. Occasionally will add important definitions to her slides. 50% quizzes are online and take home!",1
"Hard to understand what she talked in the lecture, but exams are very easy, basic",0
"He rambles, but is very knowledgeable on many, many topics. Paper topics can be confusing, but you can write anything and you'll get an A. Lectures are usually boring. I don't think anyone reads the book, you don't really need it. If you're looking for an easy class with a nice prof, this is it. Don't take this if you're interested in world myth.",1
Dr. Morgan is great! He grades the assignments fairly and is very accessible outside of class and is willing to answer any questions. He genuinely wants you to do well. Take him if you can!,1
"He will help you outside of class if you ask him. Lectures are alright, but his slides lack information. Easy midterms and assignments, but he writes them in a very unclear way, which gets confusing and results in silly points loss. Fair grading but with very little feedback. Not a lot of ways to practice and prepare, except by using the textbook.",1
Failed me for not doing the last essay when I did every other assignment in the class. Worst teacher at PCC,0
Great prof!  Always enjoy his classes and he's really engaging and helpful! Great sense of humor as well and makes classes enjoyable.,1
Very helpful. Good at answering quetions.,1
"I got an A in his class, but he is absolutely not willing to help you out or work around anything that's going on in your life outside of the classroom. Very full of himself and thinks he's better than you, but clearly he's a little insecure. Doesn't truly want to see students do well. If an answer is right but it's not what he thinks, it's wrong.",0
I loved his class! Not only did I learn so much but he showed that he really cared about his students' progress. Whenever we needed extra help he was always there for us. His kindness and respect made me want to learn and to do my best. I highly recommend him!,1
"Prof. Gier is definitely caring and a great professor! His lectures were on point, he goes through everything you need for the test. He also shows interesting videos and gives real life examples of the theory you learn, which really helps. As long as you read and do your work, his class is an easy A and you'll learn a lot!",1
"The best teacher I've ever had, super easy!  You just have to study your study guide that she goes through with the class and gives us the correct answers the class before the test.  Only thing is there's only 4 tests throughout the semester and a final exam so you better do good on the tests!  TESTS ARE SUPER EASY JUST STUDY THE STUDY GUIDE",1
"Genuinely wonderful and enthusiastic teacher. Her high levels of energy can take a bit to get used to, but she is one of the best teachers I've ever had, and explains concepts well enough that it actually helps me in other classes as well. There are two sets of homework which can be overwhelming, but overall her class is a great experience.",1
"Singularly the most boring class ever, and he's so disorganized that you don't have a clue what's going to be on the test. The thing is, he's smart- just not a great professor, at least at the introductory level.",0
"When I met this man, I was like ""Ok cool guy, easy class, I will get an A"". Jump to the end of the semester and my grade is hanging on a noose and ready to fail. His tests are brutal and are not related to anything in class or powerpoints. Random pop quizzes that are difficult as well. Do not take this class unless it's required.",0
Class ends late very often. Grades are handed back a while after the assignment was turned in.  No idea what i had in the class until i see the final grade. Enjoys her job. Attempts to get students interested.,1
"I have taken many upper level english classes and passed with As. Taking Mielke for a 200-level class and I was scared for all of the semester that I was going to fail. You think everything will be fine because he drops your two lowest paper grades but no, he is the toughest grader I have ever had at Truman and I do not suggest anyone take him. RUN",0
"Mr. Logan is a very helpful and patient teacher. He can be quiet if you are in the back and has smaller handwriting though, so if you have vision or auditory issues it's good to sit towards the front. Ultimately he is a very clear and thorough teacher who takes his time during and after class to ensure we understand the methods and theories.",1
Amazing Professor all around! HIGHLY recommend,1
"Even if political theory is not your interest, take Stoner if you need a social science class under your belt. This guy can can make any topic interesting. I Loved the books he assigned us. Easy A too. 80% of multiple choice questions on final are selected from the 2 previous exams.",1
"Dr. Simkins is a great guy but this class was somewhat challenging. If you want an A, it is attainable but be prepared to work for it. There are assignments for every class but as long as you apply some effort, you will get full credit. Must attend every class or you will lose points. Mid-term and final are in-class essays.",1
"Legend and likeable. The one freebie class first year. Easy assignments, but you don't learn much.",1
Dude really knows his stuff but is not a very good teacher. Lectures are kind of difficult to understand. Get used to doing most of your learning on your own and from the book.,0
"Class wasn't difficult. But professor checks attendance every class. Have to read textbook to pass. Professor assigns extra credit to help student's grades. Professor seems too busy, not the best to contact her through email.",1
"Professor Lawrence is perhaps the best professor I have had at BYU. He cares about what he teaches, and he cares about his students. He has wonderful insights, ideas, and assignments. His class requires preparation and attention. Without them it is possible to go to his class, zone out, and think him an average teacher. If you are prepared it rocks",1
"She grades weirdly and words her questions/directions weirdly because she doesn't proof read. Also, she wants us to cite our sources but will give us a 0 on the assignments/discussion posts if we quote from them like what??? She expects you to do your own research in addition to the chapter reading for the test so you'll see q's you wont understand",0
"He doesn't ever stay on topic, he is late to class and he keeps you over the time alloted. His opinions are never backed up an if you dont agree with him your mark suffers.",0
"She expects you to take responsibility for your learning. Show up to class, read the book, participate, and study for the exams and you will earn an A. She is willing to work with you if you need any help outside of the classroom and responds to emails quickly.",1
Mr. Anastasiade has played a key role in my interest for Java Development. His examples were just right.  He always was available during help hours to discuss concerns.  He was patient and always willing to make clarifications. I was also able to contact him via email.  Most importantly he is knowledgeable in his field. Definitely take his courses.,1
"DIFFICULT. DOESNT USE POWER POINTS VERY MUCH. KINDA JUST RAMBLES MAKING IT HARD TO REALLY KNOW WHAT TO STUDY, OVERALL HE ISNT TOO BAD,",0
When I took this class I was going through a rough patch in my life. I honestly attended this class about FIVE times the entire semester. Prof Dersch e-mailed me and asked me when I could come in and catch up. I decided to finally go and I studied my butt off. I ended up passing all of the tests during finals week. I passed with a B because of him.,1
Avoid at all cost. The professor cannot teach and makes atleast 10 mistakes per class. He is very unclear when explaining and gives rude answers to people who asks valid questions.,0
Worst mistake to take this guy... absolutely clueless,0
"Susan Kelly asks for you to do a lot of work, but the payoff is completely worth it.  I've never had a teacher seem are more about her students and actually enthusiastic about what she is teaching! If you want to be in the media field you need to this class with Susan Kelly!",1
She was all over the place in her lectures.  I could not understand or follow what we were talking about.  Assignments were hard and often vague.  I ended up dropping the class.,1
He is the man. Made me enjoy going to theatre every day over winter session. Rambles on about random stuff.,1
"I enjoyed chem 101 because of him. Made it super easy to understand. Clear criteria. Extra credit should allow all to pass easily. Sweet man, be ready to study and put in the work and you can easily get an A! Wish he would teach more chem classes.",1
"Dr. Burck is disorganized and takes weeks to grade assignments. He misuses scheduled class meetings, is frequently late, and has even attended our class via ZOOM from his car. He references his own published work frequently, and grades based on stylistic preference under the guise of APA-style formatting issues. His syllabus is vague.",0
Didn't like him. Hated his teaching. Super boring. But he was a lovely man once class was over and very kind in office hours.,0
"Professor Lopez is great! He really cares about his students and makes a dry topic very interesting. His tests are pretty easy, and his Powerpoints are very straight forward. Definitely take him for Legl 20!",1
"Professor Nelson is very interesting and intelligent. However, his ECON 202 class was extremely difficult for me. His lectures are quite boring and the class is not mandatory, but HIGHLY recommended to go. If you are not a good test taker then I would NOT recommend his class for you. Your ONLY grade is exams!!! Overall, the WORST class I've taken.",0
"For some reason AP Bio doesnt count for 121, if you took it its basically just a repeat, I did my chem labs during his lecture, barely payed attention and got an easy 4.0. If you take note in his class make sure you take them fast as he will change slides without warning. Overall seemed like a great guy and does teach whats on the tests.",1
"With Dr. Douglas, it's all in the readings (lectures are weak). Seasoned econ students will do very well and learn lots from the fantastic reading materials; new ones will be hand-held in learning how to do econ (papers, for example). The ""dry"" subject of 335 (demographic econ) may make it tough, so I gave difficulty  4; but I found it fascinating",1
"Granted, I'm already not that good at math, but I've always passed math classes with at least B's. This class is very online based. You have about 3 different types of online assignments. I missed 1 homework assignment online and my overall class average went from a 78 to a 53 and he wouldn't let me take it for a late grade. Good luck",0
"Entirely TOO much homework given in a week. It's as if he doesn't take into consideration people have lives and families outside of school. He grades very harshly, has a very condescending tone when you ask questions, the tests DO NOT match the pre-tests, and the practice problems, OMG, there are at least 45-55 questions each chapter. STAY AWAY!",0
"SO TIRING, have quizzes every Thursday, wake up early in the morning, I got to give her some credits for trying to be funny ..... very nice though... welcoming",0
"If you go to all of the lectures each week, take your own notes, & turn them in, you receive two points of extra credit for each week you do that. He says his tests are based off the lecture and PPs, but when I used those I got a D on the test. If you google search every question, you'll get end up with at least a B. Wouldn't recommend.",0
"DO. NOT. TAKE.                                          His lectures are long, boring, and unclear. There is an excessive amount of confusing readings. There are only five grades and he can be a pretty harsh grader. There is way too much material and content to cover for the midterm and final. He expects way too much for a general education course.",0
Get ready to read. The information we learned about was interesting but it was a lot of work. There is one paper and one quiz every week. Its a lot of work for an online class but it was interesting.,1
"i know im not the best at chemistry, but Dr. Bushey was very rude even when it not intentional, writes everything on his screen so its very messy and hard to read, an tests and quizzes are very difficult",0
Very boring professor if you are not interested in the subject matter. Little to nothing from  lectures actually matters for exams so don't worry too much. Fairly easy class; just a lot of random long homework/group assignments. Exams came from online quizzes that can't see the answer to unless you get 100% on the quiz which is very frustrating.,0
Proffesor Raymond gives easy marks but he don't really care if you understand the material. Better learn by yourself.,0
I love Professor Maida. She is such a sweet lady and the way she explains things makes it so clear. You absolutely have to do the homework as it helps in understanding the material and makes the tests a breeze. If you don't understand something then she is happy to help until you do. ,1
"Very boring. You will fall asleep during the lecture. Most of the time, nobody will understand what he is talking about. Attending lectures is useless. Just study at home using the book. He kinda winks all the time which I find distracting",0
"He's nice, but I haven't learned squat from him. You can come in 30 minutes before class is over & he won't count you absent, takes late assignments, won't drop you, lets you text in class, etc. He talks about himself a lot, & his organizations.",1
"Dr. Storslee is absolutely the best teacher I've had at PVCC. I love his teaching style, he's incredibly helpful, and he genuinely wants his students to succeed. He's always available to help, he's easy to talk to, and I love how he's so proud of his students. He's just an awesome teacher.",1
Avoid this professor at all cost! Does not care about you as a student. Will not let you use the rest room for a two and a half hour class.,0
"If you take her online, all she does is link you to Pearson's my math lab. I find it astonishing that she is getting paid to just have a link in blackboard without even making her own slides. If you can teach yourself statistics, its an easy A. I would recommend Doctor Kasha instead -- he is one of the best!",0
"Her lectures are very boring, although she is very sweet. Her test are difficult, but nothing too crazy.",0
"My lowest grade of college thus far. Teaches tough subjects and can move very fast and get frustrated easily. That being said, I brought my grade up from a C- to a B- and know how to take his class. Go to every office hours. He's a nice man who teared up on our last class day. Lectures in an old-school way but thats not necessarily a bad thing.",1
Marking is questionable.,0
"I enjoy listening to Professor Wadden lecture on the history of design for he will occasionally insert his sense of humor during a long lecture. These insertions of personality help to maintain my interest in the subject of Design History, I appreciate the humnan interaction.",1
"He's a really cool person, and what a breath of fresh air compared to Stats 1, but his tests kicked my ass. The textbook isn't as important as his powerpoints (which are on blackboard) and his study guides. Always go to him for help and he'll sit with you for as long as it takes you to go over it. Make sure you get a good tutor at TJ's.",1
was such an easy class and he was very caring and graded very nicely.,1
"motivate? he constintly puts people down, refering to their personal lives, and when asked for help often catches an attitude. He makes you work double hard to earn extra days off, but the days have to be benificial to him. He plays favorites badly so kiss butt!",0
"She is a horrible teacher. Not receptive to criticism at all, speeds through the presentations like a game, will have the biggest portion of the test (open response) about stuff you hadn't gotten to. If you attempt to push back on her she will talk to you passive-aggressively. I loved bio so much and she has left me hating it.",0
"I had Prof Nixon for an all online class. She was really helpful and there was a lot of work, but everything worked toward your final paper. You might think that the work is stupid, but everything had a purpose to it. She took into account how students were struggling with covid and made our finals pass or fail, which helped a lot.",1
"Excellent professor! Scary for the first half of the year, brutal midterm with no study hints. Need to know everything and the questions come from the smallest things you wouldnt expect.  After a lot of the people fail the midterm, she comes around, is nice, gives final exam study hints. Hilarious woman. Study hard. Papers require HOURS of work.",1
"Easily one of the worst profs in the chemistry department at Queen's. Particularly in labs, he teaches students things that are 100% incorrect. His own research failed, he is not up to date on chemistry, and is a good example of tenure gone wrong.",0
"Quizzes every single day, and just 10 mins per quizz, make sure show up every day for grade. She will drop some of your bad grades. She teaches very fast. Don't take her class If you are not good at math. She has no inspiration, i can't not focus on what she taught. Study by myself at home help me pass all her test",0
"A complete wacko.  Expect a lot of anti-male comments and non-sense type learning.  Easy A, but will not learn anything useful.",0
"TAKE HIS CLASS! He is extremely helpful. Take notes and you will be fine. He always provides extra credit for tests. Also, he uses real world situations in his teaching which helps a lot.",1
"This was a great class, and this is a really knowledgable man.  Starks was a pleasure to get even BAD news from and although he looks like he might be a little older, he's still smart as a whip, so don't try to put one over on him!",1
"Wingender is the best professor I've had at Creighton. He has very clear grading criteria (average of 4 tests) and he keeps his lectures both entertaining and relevant. He is not afraid to share his opinion on things, but he's very honest about that, which I really appreciate. He's an extremely friendly guy, and he'll work with you if needed.",1
"This class is a lot of busy work, which isn't all bad. Reflection papers, presentations, case studies, and two exams that aren't too difficult if you study.",1
"Killed alot of the interest I had in the subject matter of the class.  Wears the same 2 outfits every day.  Seems as though she hates lecturing, expects many minute details in exams.  Do yourself the favor-- take the class with someone else.",0
"So this guy is great. He does have a thick accent but is homework is worth 30%, he listens to his students, and his tests have extra credit and are relatively straight-forward.  He told us he curves final grades so 80% of the class makes an A or B.",1
Just don't take him.  Im trying to warn you!!!,0
"Read the textbook, do the study guides and you'll be fine. Lectures are unorganized and don't help much. 3 test plus 2 movie reviews. Attendance not mandatory. A self-taught class. I don't recommend him.",0
"Dr. Hansen is a great guy, but the lectures are on the boring side. For someone not very interested in environmental science, I had a hard time paying attention during lectures. However, I know that he is great for people that have lots of questions about the topics of discussion.",1
"Decent lecturer, will answer most questions DURING LECTURE. That's about it for positives. Acts extremely condescending on Nectir. Won't answer most questions outside of lecture time. Tests are ridiculous. Definitely not the worst prof on earth, but not all that much better. HW load is crazy. AVOID IF YOU HAVE NO PRIOR PHYSICS EXPERIENCE.",0
"best professor at pgcc for anatomy, i wish i can take him for all my nursing courses. Take him you want to learn and pass the class with an A. Highly recommended",1
Definitely take this teacher for any business or accounting class,1
"Dr. De Pree is an excellent professor with a real passion for his area of research and helping students learn. As someone not generally mathematically minded, I found ample things to engage my interests and a professor more than willing to help me over the speed humps.",1
Great with explaining concepts as he puts great examples together to clarify the different concepts. He tends to use movies and clips in his class and they are often helpful. If you want to succeed come to class and read the textbook that is assigned.,1
"What a mess! I had Igor for the lab component of PHYS 1004. As a larger, Eastern European man with a beard and tweed jacket, you'd think he'd be bold and empowering. Rather, Igor's contribution consists of mini, uninformative pre-lab talks that nobody can hear. I have, however, heard promising things about his office hours. Whatever that means...",0
"A very amazing prof. He's very quiet and monotoned, but I found his lectures very useful. He does not post any lecture notes on blackboard so you have to attend his classes or otherwise you'll miss out a lot. His quizzes were somewhat hard because of the true/false but the midterm and final were exactly based on the practice exams he's given us.",1
"She was a funny professor, but all of your grades were based on papers or assignments. There was no extra credit, and she graded extremely strict on grammar and acidemia writing. Even papers from the writing center got 10s or 11s out of 15. Tests were very easy if you attended the lectures. Mandatory semester group paper worth 75 points.",0
worst BUAD prof.,0
"She admitted, in class, that she would never give anyone a high grade in her class because she was raised in France and they are tough graders. Unless you are somehow able to meet her unclear, extremely high standards, be prepared for low grades and a lot of confusion. She is always available for her students, but she is often unapproachable.",0
"Don't even count on going to lectures. Cuz, it straight up boring. Easy math class by far, just 2 midterms and an exam. Hw set every week but just 3 questions with unlimited attempts. Textbook not needed, and recitations are a great way to learn the material fast. Easy work ;)",1
Most confusing Prof for 100 next to David McNeely. My grade went from a F under Bowman to an A under a different Prof.,0
"Show up to class/recitation, don't procrastinate with the term-paper, and you'll do just fine",1
"Amazing Professor! She made my semester less stressful. Very helpful and loved her stories of experiences. She will not stop helping you until you get an ""A"" in her class. I would definitely take other classes with her.",1
"She rambles on for way too long about nothing, barely relates it to a topic to write about. EGUMPP is stupidly long and tedious and you do it again in 111 which she teaches. She also pats herself on the back often, she says ""I'm a great editor"" about 5 times a class, and hands out papers saying to bring them back for next class but we don't use it.",0
"DO NOT take Biology with Garrison. Expects you to know things not mentioned in textbook, tests are ridiculously tough, and extremely anal. Has multiple choice on tests, but its actually multiple-multiple choice. If you're hoping to get an A in this course, do not even bother taking it with her. You need more than a great memory to pass.",0
"Really koool. Kinda crazy, funny, smiles a lot, did i mention crazy? you better gtake good pctures for him! He rides a motorcycle, and looks kinda like a skinny biker...needs a gold capped tooth though. Fun teacher.",1
He smells terrible and is not a very good teacher.,0
"To start with, as an English native speaker, I cannot understand what she said in sometimes. In addition, if youre willing to take her course, I advise that you can just download all PowerPoints and read it by yourself. When she teaches the lecture, she just read the powerpoint. If UW gives me a glass and microphone, I could also be a professor.",0
"I get A's on every paper I write.  Dr. Lewan  gave me my first B and I hated her for it.  She ended up being the best professor I had at ACC  because she cared about me enough to make me a better writer.  She does grade tough but if you love to write, take this course and you won't regret it!  I have the utmost respect for her and love her sarcasm",1
"If you take Haddad/Badrinath be prepared for a dramatic semester. Go to A+ review, use Chegg and try to buy/get the website A+ created called, ""Finzter"" it's textbook specific and helps you get a perfect score. Take hw and quizzes seriously. GRADE BREAKDOWN HW 20% Quizzes 20% #1 Midterm 20% #2 20% #3 20%",0
Paul is HILARIOUS! but his teaching could do some work... He is an amazing person but isn't very clear when describing the projects and giving you help..,0
"Dr. Spaulding is my favorite professor at UD.  I had him for ENGL 101 and took him again for ENGL 102 because I liked him so much.  Class is discussion based, and he's truly interested in what every student has to say.  Dr. Spaulding is extremely helpful.  He grades fairly and overall makes the class entertaining and fun.  Definitely take his class",1
"I had Dr. Childs for my ASE class. She is very sweet, understanding, and will always give you the time of day. Wonderful professor!",1
"Doezema has such a funny, very dry sense of humour.  Most people miss his jokes though... so sad.. he is really a pleasant man.",1
Never taken class with him but hes definitely hot,1
This is the best prof I had at Queen's. She is inspiring and made otherwise dull material interesting. Fascinating stories - get to know her if possible. She is tough to get time with cause she's in such high demand but it is well worth it (and she gives good support to her research students).,1
Worst teacher ever. does not teach or help you. highly recommend a different teacher,0
"He would rant about random things that had nothing to do with class. He has his ""lunch bunch"" that is very creepy and unprofessional. Not a good professor but I did learn a lot from the class just from the readings. Never from his lectures.",0
"Oral made me feel stupid a lot when called on in class and would get sidetracked all the time. Although he uses great examples and really explains things so you understand. His tests are SUPER easy, is an easy marker and he tells you EXACTLY what will be on exams. If you show up to class and do your work you'll do great.",1
"This is the most unorganized teacher I have ever taken in my life! We have (4) 4-5 page papers due within a 6 week time period. And she couldnt figure out how to work the online system for 3 of those weeks. She didnt even grade out first paper until one week before the summer term was over. If you are in unorganized student, you will not make it.",0
"Professor Peters is great at explaining everything and doesn't rush through things. its easy to ask her questions as she responds very well, she does not respond to emails at all. my advise it to NOT miss class",1
The lectures don't have content but the labs are great and really helpful! The online quizes literally have nothing that we have ever learnt !!! but there are only two.,0
"""You will have spare time for the midterm"", final words before a total disaster of a midterm. Nobody finished it. This prof couldn't give a proper lecture if his life depended on it. He does not care about his students at all and laughed at multiple people in lecture who complained about workload. Not just a bad prof, a bad person.",0
It is a hybrid so she expects you to read material from her websites before class.  A lot of students do nothing before class. But they think Swift is going to lecture on it in class. She doesn't.  So group work is tough. Plus everybody works so they claim they cannot meet  after class. I did most of the work for my group and learned a ton.,1
the least assignments a class can have. concise. if you have math skills you are set for an A.,1
Makes you think.,1
"Really sweet teacher. Explains material really well, just gotta come to class. Review all notes and read txt before exams. She will help if u ask her to help... just show ur intrested",1
"The curve in this class was wild. He claims to write ""difficult content"" on purpose but the only reasons the exams were hard was due to the confusing way he worded questions and lots of incorrect grammar. Overall I learned nothing but a good grade is not hard to achieve if you read the textbook. No need to go to class.",0
"It's public speaking, and she expects a lot, but if you have no problem talking you should do fine. Some of the tests are a little confusing and she doesn't always go over the material that is on the tests.",1
Very intimidating at first but she definately knows what she is talking about.  Easy B not an Easy A.. you have to work hard but it was worth it. 3 Tests plus a final- lots of vocab quizzes- you write 3 papers and have an oral presentation (group skit),1
Most understanding professor. Treats you with complete respect others. I absolutely loved her. ,1
"This professor rambles, he is boring and thinks he's funny but he's not. On top of that he discriminated against me both to me and to the student conflict resolution center. I have accommodations granted me by the DRC and he is denying me those and also misgendering me to faculty who reach out to him. Absolutely awful.",0
Worst online teacher. Im a 4.0 student and he grades DQs super hard.,0
"Dr. Melrose is an incredibly intelligent professor who obviously cares about the material covered. After explaining the material he works several examples, and he asks if there are questions pertaining homework assignments(which aren't mandatory) at the start of every class. I would take Melrose again for all my remaining math courses if I could.",1
"I'm not entirely sure what these other people were talking about, but the class isn't THAT difficult. Just do the readings you're assigned, make sure you know the words on the review sheet, and you'll be FINE. Love is very pleasant and very helpful.  Just ask.",1
"very nice prof but also strict,don't ever talk in his class , very good level of teaching and good preparation for engineers. work hard and focus on his class,it's hard",1
Yves is an extremely helpful and fun teacher.  I truly enjoyed the class and learned so much. I wish my major would allow me take additional classes in ceramics.,1
"Prof Vulakh complicates simple topics in class and his thick accent makes it even more difficult to understand him. He also yells if anyone asks questions. He erases the board very quickly before students get a chance to fully copy the notes. Although his tests are based from the homework he assigns, there is no curve and he offers no extra credit.",0
"I hated this class. Never comprehended a thing he said from the first day of class on. Crams in as many words as possible during the class and writes notes on the board that are hard to keep up with and interpret, at least for me. Save yourself the trouble - skip this class and just read the book, you'll learn more",0
"Cindy is a fabulous teacher, she brings personal stories and experiences to help make the material being covered more interesting and relate-able. If you have an opportunity to learn from Cindy I would highly recommend it. She's fantastic, if only she did more of her own marking!",1
"Great professor, very helpful and teaches you the material. The test problems can be tricky but hes a very fair grader with partial credit",1
"The tests are open-note and open book; HOWEVER, nothing she goes over in class is on the test. She is very boring; never knew I could sleep with my eyes open until i took her.",0
If you're a lazy student looking for an easy A I suggest taking this class over the summer for she caters heavily towards those students. Quizzes are online; she lectures when she is in the mood. Group projects are assigned and you remain in the same group throughout the semester. Hysterical and has a lot of good life experience to share.,1
Casey (Kazimierz) Kleindienst is a fair professor. Reading is a must to pass exams. Case studies are important for discussions & exams. Group Project should be taken very seriously. Kleindienst values participation.,1
Seems kind of out there but still a good prof. 3 tests worth 90% and a short ethics paper worth 10%. Curves a lot for exams and lectures are recorded and posted online. His catchphrase is do you agree?,1
his teaching style wasn't for me all he did was open the book and project it on the screen & read straight out from the book. he told us to not ask him to stop & repeat something bc he wouldn't. there weren't any helpful worksheets so if you take his class be prepared to read a lot & basically do everything on your own.,0
"If taken as an online class, this professor has in person (synchronous) and two to three hour long lectures (asynchronous) which is a ridiculous amount of study hours for a 1000 level course. The comments he makes on papers are unprofessional and overly rude, not even close to constructive criticism.",0
"Terrible calc teacher.Poor teaching skills, not helpful.",0
"Professor Wood is a very nice teacher. Sometimes her explanations are a bit long and confusing. The course wasn't really all that easy after the 6th chapter, but she is willing to help, and gives students many chances to catch up.",1
"gosh, everything people have said was right, i had him his last semester here, class started with 35 ended with 13, the rest withdrew, i was one of them, if that tells you anything about how terrible of a teacher he was, thank god hes gone.",0
"Dr. Brichford is a really thorough professor.  I believe the reason that people don't like him is because they were used to having teachers who graded easily and held their hand through everything. If you think he's not grading your paper fairly, believe me, it's not just you who thinks so--everyone else in the class probably does too.",1
"Do NOT underestimate this course. I took it for a grade and received very good marks on all of my papers. The grade is based on three papers and a final exam. The papers are worth 20% of your grade and the final is worth 40%. I bombed the final and barely passed the course. Searle's lectures are long and complicated, and the GSI's are a mixed bag.",0
Had the worst experience with this Professor. Had a family emergency but he did not care whatsoever and would not reply to my emails. He will make your life harder than it should be. Lots of work and hes very extra.,0
"She is knowledgeable about what she teaches. She is clearly passionate and teaches the material well. The only problem is she is terrible at getting back to students and directions for assignments are vague at best. There was an essay that had vague directions, everyone had the same questions days before. She didn't answer any by the due date.",1
he mixes philosophy into his stats class because he was a philosophy major as well as a statistics major in college. speak up in class and just be generally nice to him and it will definitley work to your benefit throughout the class.,1
"With COVID his classes are synchronous and you HAVE to go to class to get participation points/ reading questions . Before every class you watch almost an hours worth of pre lecture and class is for practice problems, so it feels like a 6 hour course. If you study his practice exams and dedicate a lot of time to this class you can get an A",1
"Mr. Abutayeb was, and still is the worst teacher I have ever had. He kicked me out of the classroom because another person kept turning around and talking, then he thought it was ME he was talking to. I tried to explain to him the what happened, but he just called security on both of use. WORST TEACHER EVER!!! GOOD LUCK WITH THIS GUY!!!",0
"Just an average class. Kinda boring, but not too much work. We had 2 group speeches, some reading quizzes, and a couple of small assignments. Read the textbook and you should be fine. The final is difficult, but it's the same test for all scom classes, so it's not just his final that's hard.",1
"Easy class, she does space out your essays which is really helpful but overall extremely boring lectures and you can't doing anything else but bare through the monotone for an hour and a half, would not recommend this teacher.",0
"One of the most exhausting classes I've ever taken in terms of overall course load, but you really get your money's worth. Bill is an expert and one of the best professors on campus. A little nutty at times but it adds to the class. If you want to learn, you'll gain a plethora of knowledge. Tests are hard and you have to be motivated to succeed.",1
He waits until the last minute to grade things. I went through the entire semester without knowing my grade and getting very little feedback on assignments even though I asked.,0
"Some of the movies he shows, are sooo incredibly boring, I would've rather have taken a nap in my own bed.  Exams are based on the movies and powerpoints, which are not posted online, wouldn't even email me just one class lecture so I could attend a family emergency. No written papers for an ENGL class which is nice. Not a bad Breadth A",0
"Awful guy, would rate 0/5 if I could. He is so rude and inconsiderate. Office hours are a joke. He'll dock you a point every punctuation error on the lab reports.",0
"Class isn't hard, just VERY time consuming. Lots of projects of plays covered in class, and waiting to do projects until the night before is NOT a good idea, but overall it's pretty impossible to get below a B. She isn't overly friendly, but she's a very easy grader.",1
"Often he would just introduce new assignments by being like ""Here, do this."" without teaching students how to do it. Coding doesn't come easy to me so since he would never teach students, I found myself asking for help with how to do some things. After a while he would just not respond at all. Professors should also teach their students.",0
"can't understand her, too much hw, and doesn't explain anything well",0
"I have him currently for religion 215 and i have NEVER been so confused! I'm a social work student in my junior year and i spend more time working on this than any of my other classes, its called comparative religion and he talks more about mythology.",0
"I withdrew this class I couldnt make it to possible. So much work ; IQs, review quiz in every chapter you read 25-30 multiple choice, and after every 3 chapters you got TEST with 75 questions. He make all the materials so difficult and hard to understands, you have to work really hard to get even C average. Worst experience. Not recommended",0
"Excellent teacher, really helps the class grasp material",1
"Nancy has a way with words. By that, I mean she gets up to her lecture podium and performs lectures in the style of ""rap god"" by Eminem. The textbook will be your best friend in this class, but the lectures are worth going to know what is up. The weekly quizzes come with a difficulty I cannot describe - they're essentially impossible.",0
"Pretty dissapointing. Her tests are Long and overshadow anything else you might do in the course. over 1/4th of your grade will be determined in 50 min and by 3 questions. She's a very nice person but is incapable of teaching. If possible, avoid having her.",0
"Great professor, very boring subject.",1
"I like when a class is hard because it challenges me but his class is just ridiculous.   He is very specific in what he wants but even if you do what he says, he will still take points off. I followed his advice on every paper and still got a low grade. Exams are hard because you have to repeat every word back that he said in lecture. ",0
"Knowledgeable, has lots of industry experience. Reasonable lecture style, expect lots of busy work, not enough thinky work. Strange mix of mind numbing handholding early on, to lots of work with missing details later. OK grader, medium difficulty exams.",1
Gives clear and real life examples to make the course simpler and relevant. Very approachable and nice. Got a question she'll take her time to break things down to make you understand.,1
"Best prof I've ever had. He marks hard and his exams are tough but he is more than willing to work with students outside of class and is committed to his students. Everything for the exams is on the handouts, you have to put in some effort, but hands down most helpful class I've taken in university and one of the best people I know",1
"I couldnt learn anything taking this course online. I found the notes incredibly unhelpful and the examples unlike a lot on the tests. Ive heard a lot of great things about this prof in class, but I would not recommend taking her online. Youd have to memorize the textbook. The worst Ive done in any course so far at MUN.",0
"This professor is EXCELLENT!!! If you have a chance to take him, DO NOT HESITATE!",1
"Professor Stephenson is really passionate about the subject that she teaches and truly wants all of her students to succeed. Some of the concepts can be tricky especially with having to learn them online but she is always open for questions, and gives you plenty of time to understand the concepts before open note quizzes and tests. Take good notes!",1
"Easy class, but extremely boring! extremely extremely boring!",0
"He said in the first class if you all deserve, i'll give you all A's. Admittedly, his tests are hard. However, he's doing that for us to learn. I got the best education possible with the best grade i can get.",1
Mr. Huffman is an amazing teacher! You learn so much and have a lot of fun! Very easy grader! I would very strongly recommend taking this class!,1
Makes very interesting and thought-provoking statements. Wants you to think about what he's saying and what you have learned about Psychology up until his class. Too bad he retired after this term ... All students should have to take a class like his where they are required to actually THINK about what they are learning.,1
She is very caring and wants her students to succeed. The main downfall was this paper we had to write which needed to be 4000-5000 words AT LEAST. If you take this class you would need to start at least a week before its due. You also have to love writing because if not its hard writing that long of a paper on something youre not interested in.,0
"If you appreciate being talked down to, being disrespected constantly, and not having your questions answered. This class is for you.",0
Mrs. McClain is a really good Professor. She is probably the best Math Teacher I have ever taken. I have never understood math from any other Teacher except her. Her lecture notes really help a lot and she breaks everything down so well to where its easy to understand. I have always hated math but because I am taking her. She helped change my view,1
"Organic Chemistry is hard so expect to work in any professors class. Heldrich will make you work for your grade. He is super tough, but you will learn this like the back of your hand! If you are just taking this class to get into a Med program, take someone else. If you are a Chem major, TAKE HELDRICH! Protip: Do the problems from each chap in book",1
"I was recommended by other people to take this class, and that was the worst mistake ever, this professor doesn't introduce topics he goes over a topic once and thats it, maybe touching back on it before the test but again only once. He isn't clear, the hw isn't helpful, he never goes over hw so you don't know if you did it right, bad class.",0
"Best prof in my whole degree. Lectures so good it makes me put my phone down and pay attention. Good sense of humor and actually cares about his students, very refreshing!!",1
As long as you read the material and complete the tests and homework you will pass this class. Mr. Flotron was always great at responding to emails when I had questions.,1
"Any one reading this, stay away from this proff at any cost. She will grade you so hard and the exam are crazy hard.",0
"Barnum has a great sense of humor and some pretty good lectures at the beginning of the year. There were 3 major projects due at the end of the semester. About 4 people in my class finished all three. Dont spend so long on the clay. He doesnt walk you through how to sculpt, you have to learn on your own. Its a relaxed atmoshphere. Would take again.",1
Professor Bailey gave limited notes in class but had you work with group members to figure things out which helped you to better learn it on your own. She was always happy to help if you didn't understand things. I felt the tests were easy if you did the study guides. I recommend her for sure!,1
The worst teacher I have ever had at UVA. He is slow and boring. Most students took a nap in his class. He hates being challenged and he wont like you after that. Very eregant man. I had to teach everything I know about that class. I got a B but I strongly believe I would of got an A if I was a girl. My girlfriend got an A!!!!!! I thought her every,0
Honestly one of the most boring teachers out there. Not only painful to sit through the lectures but always being called out randomly for no reason is so unnecessary. Best of luck to whoever takes this class. It sucked. The rest of the characters to specify my feelings about the class are not even worth the time. ,0
He said the course was going to be about Britian at War. I took the class for my interest in Britian but all we talked about was some diarist from the 1940's. By far one of the worst classes I've taken. Taking notes is hard because mid lecture he will jump from topic to topic without distinction and be prepared for TONS of reading.,0
Bima: Awesome Teacher! He would always have a Chuck Norris joke in the first slide of his lecture. I do have to disagree with him in one aspect of hist teaching. There is no room for discussion when the subject is hair color. The best hair color is always RED!,1
Professor Gillin is sooo nice!! He's very knowledgeable and easy going.  He has us do quick quizzes sometimes on the readings & they're pretty easy. He doesn't put down any of your suggestions on interpreting the readings. The midterm was an in-class critical essay and it was fine. Do the readings and contribute to class discussion & you'll be fine,1
"No matter who you take 1. MGT 366 is a hard class 2. There's no easy A. Putting aside she makes you feel dumb, there are good things about her class. She gives a lot of extra credit, tells you exactly what math problems will be on the exam (crucial, some teachers dont) and gives you a ""help sheet"" on exams. She makes sure you know the material tho.",1
One of the greatest Biology professors at UTM.  Hilarious and delivers roast sessions every day.  Make sure you study your notes before coming to class because he will call on you and expect you to answer.  Tests are difficult/tricky and easy to overthink.  Acquiring old exams is crucial if you want to make the 4 A's and be excused from the final.,1
"She's worse in Landscape Ecology. By the way: ""patterns that affect processes and processes that affect patterns"" is a circular statement that means nothing!",0
"plays favorites, hard grader",0
"Doesn't prepare for his lectures so his points come across as vague and half baked. His exams are brutal with lots of trick questions and there is no way to study effectively for them. Plus he is a very difficult marker, expect a full letter grade (or two) drop in your GPA in his class.  No listed office hours either.  Worst Prof in the department.",0
"Easily one of the nicest teachers I've had at UCF. She's a little bit disorganized, but it's nothing too serious. You have VHL homework for 2-3 days each week and some in-class quizzes. There's a project, but it's really easy. If you miss an assignment she's more than happy to open it back up for you so you can do it. Overall, a pretty easy class.",1
"He's extremely dry and boring, but he knows his material. His essay questions are really just one question applied to different texts, so don't expect much scope. He gave us 90 minutes to write three essays for our midterm. That was rough.",0
"Paul is a super nice guy, and willing to help out students with anything they need. However, he is not great at lecturing or teaching statistics to people without background on the topic. If you already know the material you will do fine, but class time is used very poorly and he often goes off on tangents. His grading is also extremely subjective.",0
"Disorganized is an understatement. Great person outside of teaching, but bad teacher. Online textbook is awful. Would not recommend this class unless you have to take it.",0
"Only a few moodle assignments at the beginning and then a midterm and final. He's very vague and wouldn't give you exact definitions of terms, but these terms would show up on the exams. Wouldn't take him again because I don't feel like I learned anything and this was supposed to be an easy LBST.",0
dr. bartz really is passionate about spreading athletic training awareness to her students and makes class interesting with her stories.  but she is very picky and inconsistent when it comes to abstracts just memorize apa. also does a poor job of announcing deadlines/assignments/test dates in class. over all a good prof though,0
"He is one of the most caring and thoughtful teachers I have ever had!  His lectures might be boring, especially in the morning, but he is very knowledgeable and you can tell he loves teaching! A little effort can get a good grade",1
"While she is nice, her teaching methods are not very practical when comparing to her exams. She emphasizes on concepts (50% of exams) but hardly ever does mathmatical examples for you. READ THE BOOK! Do all the synthesis problems and then some. She doesnt know how to clarify most things other than the way she explains them in class.",0
Prof Brown has a clear cut class. You don't use the textbook & there are 3 exams that are all lecture based. He always will answer questions & his lectures are very clear and well organized w/ great examples. He is always willing to meet to go over exams & is speedy with grading (usually has scores posted the next day). same goes for S&P PSY361,1
"Very good professor. One of the only profs in EMU College of Nursing who is actually a practicing nurse practitioner. However, her exams are very difficult. I came into this class with ALL A's my first year of nursing school and this class will be my first B. You have to study a ton for her exams and the info is not in the powerpoints.",1
He is one of the best professors I have had at this school. He knows the material and knows how to teach it to every type of student. He is extremely helpful and you will learn what you need to learn and you won't be bored to death. Take him if you can!,1
Her class is really easy. She thinks she's really radical but actually hella basic. Just do the work and you'll get an A. Kind of a joke class.,0
"The course is difficult to follow, those cencept just do not make sense. The slides are terrible to review. Prof never responses your email, and there is no clue whether we should submit the before class exercies or not, while how those exercies fill into participant point is unknown. Just do not take this course with this prof",0
"One of the worst professors I have ever had.  She made us do vocabulary assignments, and then made us use them in a sentence as part of the final.  Gives no test make ups for any reason, and no extra credit.  Could have learned entire course by just reading the text.",0
"This woman loves thermo so much, she'll make sure you love it too! She is an AWESOME prof and definitely the best I've ever had. Really helpful in class and out, has clear notes, explains topics thoroughly and has reasonable exams. If you have the choice, take thermo with her! You won't regret it",1
"A good course, well-paced, and easy if you attend the lectures.  Lectures were clear and easy to follow.  Very good, approachable, and accessible prof.",1
"Okay, here the deal. The java course was offered online. I dropped it the firs time. This professor cannot explain clearly. You have to chase him down to get answers. Questions are detail oriented. Does not explain lambdas. Online he only explains the easy examples.  The hard examples take a log time to understand and lots of reading from textbook.",0
"I stopped going to class because of how rude and demeaning she was in class. She would yell at us if answers weren't exactly she was looking for. Eventually no one would answer her questions and she got even angrier for lack of participation. Lost 20% for not participating, have to retake. Bad experience with her as department head as well.",0
"I personally do not like the class because it is a lot of reading and note taking but it isn't that hard. You have to come to class, take notes, read the books, and pay attention. He is pretty cool too. It is a lot of other peoples favorite class.",1
She is the worst professor I have ever have. You have to know dates and specific numbers precisely for her online quizzes which are so specific. Her grading of essays is the worst. I have NEVER had a professor who told me my vocabulary wasn't professional enough till her. She is boring to listen to and does not have an organized classroom at all.,0
One of the best Accounting professors at CSU. Reasonable amount of homework & challenging but fair exams. Highly recommend.,1
"She is a great professor who gives great lectures. The class is easy, but the tests are on material that she talks about in class, so you have to go, pay attention, and take notes. Study notes before the test, write the paper the day it's due, you'll still get an A.",1
"Get ready for tons of lectures and notes. As long as you pay attention you'll pass. Has extra credit assignments here and there, but he's very passionate about the subject and expects you to discuss the topics.",1
2 words - boring and easy. You could get away with not paying attention in class and learn from the readings. If you're not particularly interested in history take this guy.,1
Dr. Piland is a great teacher. He can break down course material for anyone to understand and apply. He uses analogies to help students understand alot. Very interactive with students so come to class engaged. You must read and spend time outside of class studying! When preparing for tests make sure you just don't remember info but how to apply it.,1
Boring,0
I loved her. Super easy and super nice. Take her. All of the test questions come from her notes. Study and you will be fine.,1
"Honestly, one of my favorite professors at Ferris. His lectures initially seem a little unorthodox and rambling, but the information all ties in together for the test. He's one of the few professor that I recommend to other students. Great Professor!",1
"This teacher is the absolute worst teacher I've ever had. She's incredibly unclear and confusing. The more she tries to explain, the more confusing it becomes. It's clear she doesn't know what she's doing. The homework is on way too many different websites and never seems to have anything to do with what we're learning. Exams are very difficult.",0
"Cares about her students, gives very helpful feedback and tips; lectures are to the point and easy to understand.",1
"The ambiguity of Dr. Eubanks' grading is extremely frustrating. You can expect to receive zeros on assignments with no constructive criticism or explanation, as he seems to have a complete disregard for his own rubric (which he almost never uses). His contradictory feedback makes this class even worse. Awful experience. Do not take this class.",0
This professor is very boring and does not stay on topic during lectures.  Tests are somewhat difficult you will need to study.  I do not recommend him at all.,0
I am an A student and found this class easy. I LOVE KENKEL! She is super nice and helpful. I took her for HR and Man. Comm. Man. Comm. is a super helpful class. She is wonderful. We facebook friends.,1
"Do yourself a favor and do not take this class. Kumar is such a tough professor, if it is not his way you will lose points. There are many excel projects and he does not explain them well either. A lot of extra credit, but you cannot pass on that alone. There is not a book which is nice, but maybe one would help..",0
"Professor Anderson is great. His class is lecture based with short readings assigned. He shows some cool comedy skits that relate to the material. If youre uncomfortable discussing and thinking critically about religion, dont take his philosophy course. Pay attention and participate. He will fail you if you are frequently absent, so show up.",1
"Honestly the only reason I did poorly in this class is because I just didn't care enough and was definitely playing Mahjong in class. He is a great professor and if he sees you TRYING he will help. But if he knows you don't care then neither will he. In that case, may the odds be ever in your favor because no one will volunteer as tribute. Goodluck",1
Brian is honestly one of the most condescending teachers I've ever had. He will call you out in class to sing in front of everyone. I was never motivated to go to class because I knew if I did something wrong he would say something snide and humiliate me in front of everyone. I tried get help from him and he could not answer my questions clearly.,1
"Worst I've had yet. Awkward and gives lectures that have nothing to do with the homework, which takes Herculean effort to get through for each assignment. You essentially have to teach yourself everything. Totally not recommended unless you're a TEL/MAS major and have to take this class.",0
"This professor made one semester for me at Northeastern a living Hell. Easy enough class, but my experience with him was one of the worst in my academic career. Do not take a class with this professor f you are a working student or require flexibility with your deadlines/workload . 0/10.",0
"Prof Helmreich is a really good guy, and while his teaching methods may work for some people, they did not work for me at all. I got a tutor for the final because I could not understand his methods. However, if your grade on the final is better than your course grade, you get that grade, and he drops your lowest test and 4 lowest homework scores.",0
"Dr. Pohjadak is an example of what every prof should be. He is knowledgeable, informative, funny and cares about his students. He admits to marking easily; just make sure you go to class as anything that comes out of his mouth could be on the exam! Great prof. One of my favourites.",1
"This class is easy! There is not a lot of work to do in this class besides the workbook activity, interview, and some quizzes. You can work ahead if you take it online and finish way before the semester ends.",1
"Not a bad class. However, I think his role in helping to get students into law school is highly overrated. If you want to go to Duquesne, he can help. Otherwise, you're on your own. Best part of the class was Charlie Wilson's War. Law school is nothing like his class.",0
"Wei is an excellent professor. Her lectures teach students important theorems from the book and proofs her gives are clear and easy to understand. Although attendance is not mandatory, one should not miss her lectures. Final is largely based on homework and not hard at all for students who carefully finish their homework with their own effort.",1
she is garbage!,0
"Explains about how learning proofs is an objective when he never properly gives similar examples during lectures that are tied to practice problems, tutorials or tests.",0
Interesting class with great content. Participation matters and will get you the best grade possible. Highly recommend.,1
This guys one big hairy American speech writing machine!,1
"You might as well teach yourself. Besides giving piles of homework as if you don't have any other classes, she gives very difficult tests. She rushes through her lessons and tends to squeeze everything into one day. Just avoid this professor.",0
His quizzes are fair and that's the only good thing I have to say. He makes students feel stupid for asking questions and yet he can never figure out a better way to explain a topic. He doesn't collect the homework but instead wastes a ton of time going over it in class. So dry. Would not recommend.,0
Great professor... fun and funny.  Makes you think critically and respects your opinion.,1
Pete is amazing.....he should get a raise!!!!!!!!!,1
"Homeworks is optional, but do it! Trust me! I didnt do my homework the first half of the semester and only passed this class by the Grace of God! VERY test heavy. Does not give extra credit. Usually only explains things one way even if you ask because you do not understand. She tries hard to be helpful and great; but in my opinion, she isnt.",0
Don't bother with the book if you aren't going to read it. As long as you know the powerpoints she posts/ half listened in class you'll ace the exams. Easy grader and flexible with homework assignments. Put effort into the presentation because she is more critical of that.,0
She is a very fast pace teacher. Her tests are MUCH harder than what she teaches in class. She provides no grading curve or extra credit. During drop/add more than half of my class left. I would not advise taking her class.,0
"I'm not sure why he has such terrible reviews. Yes, he's older but I really enjoyed his class. Expect weekly homework assignments, not hard but time consuming. There is one group project due at the end of the quarter, pick partners wisely! His lectures can be long but he's very knowledgable. Very nice professor too. ",1
I have no idea what everyone is complaining over. I never read much of the book and I still managed to get an A in the course. Just make sure you do the required work and you should be able to pass his class. I would definitely take another class with him!,1
"I think a complete waste of money. She will base everything on text book, zip through slide shows and be irritated that you want to go back to the last slide ""all of this is in the book"" which makes lecture seem very pointless, boring. Shes sweet. but its a very frustrating lecture, you wont get anything out of it.",0
"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS, especially not as a gen ed. He expects way to much for a 100 level class. His lectures are boring, despite the topic being interesting. His assignment directions are vague and confusing, and the assignments themselves are tedious and non-beneficial in the long run. Class is boring and mandatory, and I had to buy 6 books.",0
"Professor Cornish was easily the worst professor I've had at GVSU. While it's evident that he knows the material really well, he has a major problem conveying the material in such a way that is clear and understandable to someone who is unfamiliar with course material. His lectures were dull and basically consisted of him rambling on. AVOID.",0
She is great at teaching the subject but does not have a friendly personality. Once you make the effort of talking to her she is clear and precise. ,1
"Ridiculous tests (90-110 mark on a 45 min midterm, 430+ marks on the final). Spends 35/45 min talking about her trip to northern Canada and how she waters her plants. Covered 1/3 of the course material and crammed the rest in 2 weeks (still added that to the final). Simply awful.",0
"Get prepared to read a lot. The quizzes are really hard and he doesn't help you with your studying for your final exam.  Even if the class is online, I feel that his the kind of teacher that doesn't want his students to pass.",0
"I usually can do well if I go to class and don't study as much, or don't go to class much and study hard. I studied hard and hardly ever missed class and STILL didn't get the grade I think I deserved. 3 weeks before the final exam, announced it would be 45% of your grade. Tests seemed easy, my grade said it was just an unnecessarily tricky game.",1
Quite easy in my opinion. Took this class before and didn't pass took it with Yemut and did amazing not particularly great at math but was really excited when I got an A on a test. Simple do your homework and tests are ALWAYS 25 questions. ,1
He is an accounting stud!  Follow his ways and you will be successful.  ,1
"Too vague. Doesn't elaborate on what he wants for his papers, so he just gives half credit.",0
"Not a bad teacher, super easy marker, 2 750wrd papers, first test was easy. the final is not cumulative. he's a bit of a bore. sitting in class is pretty brutal but he puts all of the notes online so you dont have to go to class. hes a bit of a scatterbrain. overall: not bad at all.",1
"She is not easy at all.  Do not take her online if you work or have family because she send a lot of homework.  She also is very hard for this class level.  I admit I learned a lot but It cost me too much.  She is also very responsible posting the grades, every organize person and willing to try help you.  But becareful she is not easy!!",1
"Un des pire prof que jai vu et eu. Les examens sont totalement diffÃ©rents des exercices donnÃ©es. De plus, il semble se ficher des Ã©lÃ¨ves en difficultÃ©s. Toutefois vous Ãªtes assurÃ©s davoir au moins 15% de majoration aux deux examens..",0
"His class was so frustrating, he makes class participation 20% but when you raise your hand to voice your opinion, he cuts you off, you are not allowed to have an opinion apparently. His papers were easy, but he marks you down for ridiculous things, and he doesnt tell you what he really wants in his paper. EXAMS ARE IMPOSSIBLE",0
"I taken professor Ivey, in many classes he is always there to help and to make sure you succeed. His caring and respectful and his classes as long as you do your work and test are easy you'll pass his class.",1
"absolutely love him. He looks and talks exactly like woody harrelson, but he's like a less intensified grandpa version of him. Perfect teacher to take a songwriting class from. He's also easily approachable.",1
"He is extremely good at explaining really dense topics in a way that's easy to understand. There is very little reading, but the reading that is assigned is very important. The way he conducts exams and activities is to promote learning rather than meaningless memorization. Super chill dude. Your mindset will be challenged in his class.",1
"A lot of hype to take his class. However, I wouldnt recommend it. He doesnt really like questions and is easily frustrated if you dont understand something.",0
Do not take this professor. Almost like he wants you to fail. Very hard class. Expect to teach yourself,0
"Professor Alebe is extremely enthusiastic & helpful.His assignments are very specific but if you follow his outline you will do great-go in for help though, have him edit your essays & go to class as he does attendance.This is a CRITICAL writing class so dont go in with any worldchanging ides; he's teaching you how 2 write critically not creatively",1
There are no classes only discussions if a student can help host a zoom for him. There is no syllabus and it's stressful because there is no structure. He is a very sweet guy and tries his best to teach during these trying times but I don't recommend him for online classes. The only two things he's grading is a midterm and a final that's it.,0
"Do not take her!! She loose your work & you have to remind her multiple times about putting in your grade, if you don't you wont get a grade for it and its on you. Its aloooot of homework, 5 of exams and 5 quizzes through out the semester. Tests are based on her lecture, book and learnsmart and even though its open notes they are not easy at all.",0
"This has been my worst teacher in my time at PCC. Schubert does not teach well at all. He does all the problems and lectures with his back to the class and by the time he turns around, he's completed the whole problem and blocked it. Anytime someone asks for help he either says, you should of learned it in the last math or go to tutoring. TERRIBLE!",0
"This is a hard class. I'm an A student. I highly recommend you don't take this class. It is not a blow off, it's absurdly hard to get a good grade in. Tests frequently include the most vague, niche usage of terms. The test questions often have spelling mistakes. If you mess up one test, your grade will tank. The textbook is also pretty bad.",0
Should stick to math I have him more english,0
"Dr. Qi's lectures are disorganized and hard to follow.  If you take her for environmental chemistry, the book will be very helpful for clarification.",0
"taking a class with this guy is a great choice if you enjoy confusion, suffering, and sadness. solid choice if thats what youre looking for",0
"The class I took was an online class. She had video lectures for each chapter and all the tests were open book tests.The tests were not extremely easy, even though they were open book (they are timed). You did have to study and read the chapters. Any time I had a question, I would email her and she would promptly answer. I really enjoyed the class.",1
"In this class, you go far into depth about the history of media, rather than just media itself. My favorite times of this class would be his comedic entertainment throughout lectures and the documentaries. The 60 or more articles needed to be read for an exam of only 50 questions, I find ridiculous! I would appreciate if the slides were online.",1
4 exams throughout the year and he drops the lowest exam score. Weekly quizzes that you need to make sure you take or you won't pass. Attendance required for clicker points.,1
"If you enjoy being tested on material not covered in class, go ahead and take this class.  I don't so I dropped it.  Worst teacher I've ever had, if you see this mans name, get as far away from it as possible.",0
"Dr. derrick knows what he is teaching, but his lectures are very boring. He is not always very clear either. He is nice and approachable.",1
"BAD. BAD. BAD.  Unavoidable, so you're doomed.  If you kiss ass, you'll get somewhere.  Enough said.",0
very hard class. make sure you study your notes for every class and only skim the books for the tests.,0
"Best history class, ever. He used a ton of media to supplement his super-comprehensible lectures. If you miss a reading but listen to the discussion, you can still pass the quiz. Seriously - show up and pay attention and you'll easily pass the class. And you get to hear awesome music twice a week!",1
"Does not care. Does not care. Does. not. care. If you need help on assignments or on expanding course content beyond the slides she reads verbatim in class, she is insulted by your presence in her office. She's hard to avoid for this course, but if you can, take it with someone else. She should not be teaching.",0
"Don't show up to lectures or get the book. Tbh, theyre both long and boring. Conte's a nice guy, but the subject material is kind of stale. Theres 3 tests (each worth 25% of grade), and a 7ish page paper (also worth 25%). The exams are definition based, just study his powerpoints and find good quizlets on the material and you can get an A cramming",1
"Doesnt respond to email, and is so rude to students. Its like she expects us to know everything already.",0
"At first he replied to the emails fast, then the last time I sent him an email, he didn't reply, which cost me a grade. I don't know what to say about him, but I would never take him again.",0
his class was ok. I like the fact that Dr. Thompson is fair. I took his class during Covid-19 so both the class and the lab was online. On a quiz we had to name the bones of the cranium and for a particular section it was very difficult to label without being shown in person. He understood this and graded the quiz accordingly with a curve.,1
"For this class, we were required to buy 10 books. We used them minimally or not at all. These books are used for this class only, so we cannot sell them back. He also was not present for the first two weeks of class and often made us drive off campus to schools in Waterloo 20 minutes away. You will never know your grade; he doesn't use blackboard.",0
"Dr. Cochrane is one of my favorite professors I have ever had! It's a interesting class. It is a WI class so there are readings but they're pretty easy and all you do is discuss them the next day in class, no quizzes on them. Only one 5ish page paper and 1 project. 3 tests, all are easy if you show up and engage. Dr. Cochrane truly cares about you!",1
"Easy.  But frustratingly, irritatingly, infuriatingly, mind-bogglingly inane classes.  If you seek to learn, do not look here.",0
"Examples done in class do not work. Reads off of lecture slides. Hands out assignments before completing it himself causing many errors in assignment specifications as well as trying to explain, spend over 2 hours of lecture time trying to clarify the assignment. ""ALMOST INVENTED LINUX"" The point is that he does not give you skills for your future",0
"Prof Schlick taught a total of 4 classes this semester.  She wasted time with individual presentations AND group presentations.  Her required reading was extensive and uninteresting.  While doing group presentations, she was more concerned about time limiting everyone than listening to what we had to say.  She interrupted 34 of the presenters.",0
The cutest professor you'll ever have! Curve is not 13%. It's about 6% but depends on the year.,1
Lectures are amazing in how little Dr. Whipple prepares or seems to care. He is respected for not expecting much of anything from students. And he is hilarious because it is shocking that his man still is allowed to teach.,0
"I studied for an entire week for his final and still failed. I worked night and day to even PASS this class and I still came within .5% of failing. No matter how hard you try, you will always be disappointed with the grade you receive on papers and exams. Don't take this class. Spare your GPA. Take someone else. You will regret this.",0
"I like Mark a lot, and I think he's a great guy! That being said, the course content and material was all over the place, and I found that the group projects would have been easier as individual assignments. Lazy and uninterested students in your group; especially, when you take classes in Marks class, will kill your grade. Go solo when you can.",0
"Can't even explain how terrible of a professor he is. Vague notes you can't access online, answers questions poorly, another prof makes the tests and seraphin is pretty clueless about them. Found out the format of the final was different than what he told us only because my friend emailed him. Doesn't even know about the tests he's giving us.",0
She's not very clear and doesn't give good examples in class. You not required to attend but there is a graded assignment every class. She is very helpful if you go to her though. Be ready to read the textbook and don't be afraid to go to her office and you will pass.,1
"Dr. Nochera is not a very good professor. Her online lecture videos were nothing like the exams at all. Her lectures are just her rambling and she is not very good at explaining. There is barely any work to be graded, so if you don't do good on the exams you're basically screwed.",0
"Even though I've only completed one year, Professor Biby is the best instructor I have had a GV so far. She is an extremely nice and helpful lady, but at the same time makes you work hard and think about the concepts. I would highly recommend her.",1
"You really have to learn it yourself. Plus, he will wait until the end of the semester to grade anything, so you have no idea where you stand in the class. However, he does curve. A lot. Big curves. Like where did that come from? Still a stressful class though.",0
"Dr. H is the best professor I've had so far at WKU! Her lectures are clear and contain everything you need to know for her tests, which ARE hard.  She has a great sense of humor and makes lectures interesting, and as long as you go to class [like you're supposed to] and actually enjoy learning with an open mind, the class will be very rewarding.",1
I took two classes with him. One was intro to visual basic and the other one was Internet Programming for Business.He is a very nice teacher and explain the material so well.One advice: if you do your homeworks and projects you pass easy. Tests: There are no trick questions.Just pay attention to what he says in class and read the book. A+ guarantee,1
Took this class a couple years ago but my experience was awful. The guy didnt give me the time of day when I tried to ask for help which was 3-4xs a week and even made snide comments toward me when I didnt understand the material. The only prof. Ive had a problem with ever.,0
"she is very unorganized, i would recomend professor Iviricu or bloomers.",0
"Very difficult class... I took this class over Winter and it consumed my time.  We did about a chapter a day, and we had to learn it on our own.  After we read the chapter we had about 4-5 homework problems and no help.  If you didnt understand the material, well that was too bad for you and your grade.  No help at all- difficult exams boring labs.",0
He is very interested about applied math.,1
EPIC FAIL,0
"Interesting, friendly professor, but I ended up dropping his class by the end of the first week because his ""humor"" was so inappropriate. I enjoyed his style of teaching, though, and he seemed like he would be a helpful kind of professor.",0
"The beginning through 3/4 of the semester, I loved her class. I was an A student. I missed ONE peer review (yes, I emailed her and told her before hand), I was then told I couldn't turn in my final paper, my grade dropped to a C-. She had no remorse. Typical busy work. Decent feedback and able to revise and resubmit your paper for a new grade.",0
"Nice guy, but I lost count the amount of times I almost fell asleep in this guy's lectures. Talks too fast, and goes through slides like lightning fast. Goes so fast we all have to take pictures of the slides since he doesn't post the solutions to the questions. Also his quiz and exam questions are WAY TOO HARD, ended up failing the final.",0
"Yeah, he's a good professor in lectures and you've really got to pay attention to the formula he focuses on because those will be on the test and you will need to memorize them - tests are quite difficult but if you know those formulas and do lots of past tests and homework you'll be ok but get ready for lots of work",0
Very boring lectures even though the prof is nice. It is fairly easy to pass her classes because the exams are all projects. Attendance is mandatory (she makes us sign a paper at the end of the class) but I've worked on other projects in her class while she was talking. Easy A but boring.,0
"THIS PROFESSOR CHANGED MY LIFE!! He is amazing. That class was so interesting- i actually looked forward to going to class. I did not do any of the assigned readings, rather i paid attention during lecture and I have an A+ in the class. it is not an easy class unless you pay attention(luckily, he's intriguing). I will miss this class.",1
"Professor Girgis is a very nice lady, but lectures were boring. Attendance was not required, but if you watch the lectures you will be fine with the weekly assignments. Exams are straight from study guides so it is easy to get a good grade. Also, group projects are a crucial part of the class and she makes the groups for you.",1
Do not take this course She is the worst teacher in this college,0
"Warners is one of the best Bio profs. 225 is not so great. His lectures are clear and very interesting, with constant examples from the world of plants (more interesting than one might expect). His knowledge of the subject is vast and very impressive. Plus, he's a wonderful person who's very invested in his students and always willing to help.",1
i think he is great!!!,1
"awsome prof.  can't say enough great things about the guy.  he's nice, his lectures are funny and cute and he really, really will take the time to talk to you.  i studied hard for his class, but he made studying easy because lectures are so clear.",1
"Doesn't seem to care about students. Doesn't take any feedback into consideration. Material wasn't hard, but the test were way too fast paced for what was expected in responses. ",0
I hate every day of it.,0
"Laura is a really great prof. She tells a lot of real life stories to clear up topics and her lectures and guest speakers are interesting. She's strict on wording in papers and when speaking because she doesn't want anyone to be disrespectful to people who have communication disorders. Her papers are all 1-2 pages tops, double spaced. Great class!",1
Knowledgable and understanding.  Her class could benefit if she did not use power point and goes through the material faster.  The TA's can be very critical.,1
"Extremely unprofessional, rude, and frankly, not very bright, and arrogant, yet she does not have anything to back up her arrogance, she is coasting in he job until she can retire. Beware potential MA students, the faculty disrespect Pub Desgn students and only care about the MFA students, go somewhere else.",0
I took the Business 160 class and Im just want to say Professor Norwood is an exceptional Professor with skills of which he obtains to unlock parts of my brain that I never had used before. He will go down in history as one of my most favorite professors I have ever had. I would not be writing this comment if it was not true.,1
Attempts being nice and helpful but it comes off as being out of her character to help you out; you are better off just doing your best without approaching her. Textbook is expensive and not really needed because exams consist of only topics discussed in class; take good notes and you will be fine. ,0
"Mr. Parker is the best math teacher I've ever had. Although some people may take his sense of humor sarcastic, you really just have to get to know him. Mr. Parker is very understanding when it comes to grading and homework. As long as you talk to him he will try to help you the best way he can.",1
"one the the best teacher I had in my entire life, I am now Chiropactor. In 1974 , i graduated in electronics (automatism and computer) . Always good report from the  30 of us in the class. Him and I where good friends, I always remembersd him as one of a kind. Thank you very much Ken for your insight and your great care of your students to achieve.",1
"Best prof ever! Very caring and helpful, and passionate about what he does.",1
"She is a nice professor, but not a very good lecturer. The pace of her class was too slow and made it hard to focus. She can totally cover more interesting topics as long as she spoke faster.",1
"More than half of the class got D's or F's and Dr. Stone confirmed it in an unprofessional letter to the students. There is no mathematical curve in this class. So if everybody gets below a 60% as their final grade, they are all getting D's or F's. And he said doing the homework and easy quizzes are count as a curve. Avoid this guy at all costs!!!",0
"Olney is great! Class is completely lecture-based, but he makes everything easy to understand. Pay attention in class, skim the textbook, and you'll do good.",1
"Legit goes over a slide for 15 minutes and talks about irrelevant things that can get pretty boring. Assignments are bland and no resources are available to help. Don't even get me started on the test, jesus.....",0
"- Take Econ 101 with Carvalho - You don't need the textbook if you have Carvalho - If you make notes in class, you will be fine - Very helpful - Very friendly - Wants you to do well - Tells you what will be on the midterms - Available outside of class - Funny",1
Tough grader but excellent in discussion sections at covering the material. Fair grader as he learns your writing.,1
"This is your warning. Firstly, your entire grade is based off of 3 exams, with 10 questions on each; meaning every question is worth 3% of your final grade. I had an A in this course until the final exam, where Kaufman decided to claim I plagiarized a 5 word sentence, which I did not. Therefore, dropping my final grade from an A to a D. Do not take",0
"Really hard tests, they are not curved. Lots of printed out notes to memorize.",0
"I would NOT recommend Eric for anyone who struggles with math. He is a nice guy, but he really isn't the best teacher. If you are the type of person who can figure out math on your own, he'd be good for you. For those who need extra help and an easier breakdown, he is definitely not for you.",0
"an amazing professor, take anything with him, it will be worth it",1
For those who dont know John Street is actually the ex Mayor of Philadelphia so you will get more of a background of what it is like working in local government because of him. This was only a GenEd course but I thought he was very funny and extremely helpful. However the simulations got old real quick ï¿½ï¿½,1
Professor Reich is an awesome professor who seems to really care about his students and teaching. The discussion sections are the only downside of taking HIST225 but he still makes them fun and easy. I highly recommend Dr. Reich,1
"He doesnt even know the answers to his own material. Doesnt teach concepts properly, its a self teach course. Doesnt matter if you came with a 90+ from highschool hes just that bad. Study from the textbook. 2 assignments a week are too much.",0
Very knowledgable but doesn't even stick to his syllubus. He takes the class so face paced that he forgets what he's doing and when he sets due dates. No tests just papers. Make sure you know the active voice if you decide to take the class. Class began with 18 people and ended with 9.,0
"Paretta is tough. If you're looking for an easy A look elsewhere, but if you want to learn there is no one better. You will know accounting better than anyone who took it with a different professor. He is a good teacher but the way his class is set up he will only help you if you ask for it. Quizzes do not count but take them seriously.",1
"Dr. McCorquodale was a guest lecturer for Professor Ku's section of ENG100. It was hilarious. I really like how he is. I wish he were teaching full time again. He swears a lot and makes funny jokes, but what is really important is he tells us about industry and what is happening. I think his comments will influence my career decisions.",1
"The only main problem I have is that a lot of the links to website readings were not available. Also, whenever I would email him, he would take almost 3 days to respond. I feel like this screwed my grade up because I couldn't access those links until last minute when he finally made them accessible/fixed them.",0
very bad and partial,0
He's an extremely good professor! really cares about students and its really good at explaining the material. Highly recommend! :),1
He talks very low and monotone which makes it hard to concentrate on what he is saying. He does try to explain but his explanations are hard to understand at times. All homework is online which could be annoying.,0
and Danc 145,0
"Professor Fan is a very good professor. She is an expert in her field and her passion for teaching is incredible. The course is a bit difficult, but she is always there to help. Class consists of 4 tests, 4 homework assignments, and 1 case paper. Overall a pretty easy class just need to put in the effort.",1
Terrible! Completely chaotic class meetings. Discussions are not guided. Most unpleasant class meetings I've experienced. Expectations unclear. Opportunities to excel are few. Just take something else instead.,0
"She treats everyone as if they already know programming. It is Intro to Programming, I don't think she understands what the word ""Intro"" means. I do have to give her credit for the quizzes & tests because one was able to study the same questions online, however the way she explained things were not clear.",0
"Lori was a mess of a professor. Rude, arrogant, and all over the place quite honestly. The class taught themselves each chapter every week and she completely could care less about the stuff being taught. As a matter of fact - she never taught once. Also, twice a week meeting class only met once a week, forcing tighter deadlines.",0
This dude should not teach. I just hate this guy. Avoid his class at all cost. It is not worth your money and time. Dean or someone has to see the way he teaches. He would be fired right away.,0
"This  is my first semester taking a class with him, and he seems to confuse me during lecture. I wish we could switch classrooms though. I will update at the end of the semester",0
"Dont recommend Shahid for harder courses like Static. He is worst professors I ever had in UB. His homeworks are often and are inconsistent to the class lectures. Also tests and quizzes tends to be more subjective. Please take this class with different professors. If he is only one teaching Statics, take this class in ECC if you can",0
"Avoid this class at all means possible.  It requires much more work than an intro class and more time consuming than 3 credits should be. If you are thinking of being a chemical engineering, you will really rethink it after this class.",0
Dr.Uehling is very interesting.  He wants you to learn and doesn't tolerate lazy students.,1
You teach yourself Italian in his class. No help. Lots of busy work. Rude attitude.,0
He is a nice guy but at first he doesn't come off that way. He wants you to work hard as if it was your major. You will have to teach yourself throughout the whole course. This course is hard and you may need a tutor. If you take this class make sure you read ahead and request the power points from him via email and GOOD LUCK,0
"Before taking her class I looked on here and she had a good rating but now It's lowered I can see why since I'm in the class and it's terrible, she's such a hard grader and doesn't explain work well I'm always confused, and I didn't find out my grade till the end of the semester, now I know who not to take for enc1102.",0
Waste of time to go to class. He just rants about non-relevant topics that are fairly self explanatory. He doesn't actually seem to understand to what he's teaching. It was the worst class I've ever taken.,0
"One thing to note, she opens up the on-line class way in advance of the class actually starting, and allows for students to post dates for presentations.  This give an un-fair advantage to those who register early.  Those who start the class on time are left with the worst presentation dates.  It is true, she favors male students over female.",0
"Every single one of her exam questions is a trick question. Just beware of that. On all three exams of hers, I studied very hard a day prior, felt great on the exam, and still only got 70% or sometimes less as my final result.",1
"Don't take him!! It's difficult to verbalise just how tedious he is-like a recording of an unfunny Mr. Rogers narrating lectures in slow-motion. Very unclear about requirements, however he spends 20 mins at the beginning of each class repeating the date of every quiz and assignment. Treats you like a child-don't get caught doodling or looking away.",0
"DONT TAKE HER CLASS! You'll never get full credit. Nothing meets her ""standards"" even if you've followed all instructions to the T. She's one of those profs who like to take points off for nothing, but when asked she'll have no negative things to say. Very frustrating! Put in SO much effort, only getting a B. I feel I deserve 5 A's at this point.",0
not a fan of this professor. he isn't friendly and does not accept questions in class. his tests are extremely detailed-oriented and not accessible for individuals not fluid in science. all of my science major friends are unhappy with him. would avoid. ,1
"The course was good, Professor was explaining well",1
"He's knowledgeable, but doesn't communicate what he wants in the class effectively. I felt as if I was spending more time trying to figure out what he expected rather than actually learning the material. Only employs lectures, homework, and two exams. If you mess up one aspect, it'll be hard to catch up",0
"Although he is a nice guy, his teaching is awful. He's very unclear and his lectures are confusing and seemingly pointless. He provides little to no grading criteria which is really frustrating because he is a tough grader. I really love mythology but he made it boring.",0
"One of the nicest professors I have ever had! She is very understanding, and if you need any extra help she is always willing to help you. She wants her students to succeed, and I  would really recommend her as a professor.",1
He doesn't work with you ever. Nice personality but i wish I went elsewhere for my classes because I can't tell you what I've gotten out of his class.,0
"Laura does a great job at making her grading criteria very clear and leaves future modules open during the entire class so you don't have to go at the same pace as everyone else if you like to work ahead. Assignments are really easy, typically a writing assignment of 300 words or less. I would for sure take another class by her. ",1
"Prof. Barnes was a very horrible professor. She constantly goes off topic while teaching and you will learn absolutely nothing. She grades speaches extremely hard and leaves rude comments along with the grades. I took her class after reading all of these good comments. However, it was a huge mistake. I will finish with and A but shes still horrible",0
"Dr. Keeling is a great professor! You can tell she cares a lot about the class and students. You're expected to buy about 20 children's books, and read a book, sometimes 2 every week, which need to be read to do the correlating journal entries. She assigns several outlines/papers thought the semester, but she clearly defines what she expects.",1
"While content reviewed in class is posted on blackboard, his notes aren't understandable if you miss class. There's about 5 assigned books, they're horrible reads and if you just listen when he reviews them you don't need to read them. He doesn't help when asked for assistance. Lots of writing required - 3 wikis and 28 blogs. ",0
expect to fall asleep...she has a lot to share but geez absolutely no life in her!,1
"By far the best teacher in the department. I was DREADING taking this dance class, I hate to dance + thought it would be so embarrassing. BUT it turned out to be completely the opposite with Fuchs. He made it extremely fun and not embarrassing at all. He makes everyone get to know each other so you feel comfortable dancing with every1. TAKE FUCHS",1
"Breaks up the lecture into mini videos which made it more appealing to watch. Class consists of weekly discussion posts, small writing assignment, midterm, and final. No need for textbook. Write down everything she says in lecture vids and memorize. Questions on exams can be vague and require some thinking but not too bad. Interesting course!",1
"Very challenging class. Information is launched at you very fast, with poor organization sometimes. Questions rarely return clear answers. He is a great guy, but it is a tough class.",0
"He thinks EXTREMELY highly of himself while playing the ""modest"" card.  I can tell you all about his life because storytelling is all he does.  The classes themselves aren't bad, I just wish it was with a different professor.  Roll call for 20 students took 45 uninterrupted minutes.  And he's late very often.  Yet people seem to worship him.",1
"Professor Lee was a typical math professor. Assigns homework quizzes ( at the end of some classes!), issues tests, and lectures. Straight forward class and professor. Textbook was not always used, but is essential in the homework quizzes.  Has a strict attendance policy!",1
"Dr. Hilgers is simply the best of the UMR CS dept.  It is very sad to see him go, but the IST students will be better off with him in their midst.",1
"I had an awful experience with this professor, he was extremely condescending towards students with questions and showed little respect. He also did seem to appreciate the need for disability accomodations and even attempted to avoid providing them. If you can take this class with anyone else, please try! This class will only add unecessary stress.",0
"Worst professor ever. Never responds to emails, terrible lecturer, awful organization skills, and even tests contain thousands of typos and dont even make sense. Reading the textbook did not help at all. Only thing is is that he curves. Useless professor avoid if possible",0
How is this not the same person posting 5 times a day and pretending to be different people?  And why?,0
"Professor Epley's class isn't that difficult as long as you follow instructions and do your assignments. We did have a few pop quizzes involving reading, so I would recommend keeping track of homework and essays and getting it all done ahead of time. Overall, it was a pretty fun experience.",1
condescending...misses class,0
"Great professor! Professional. Respectful and understanding. Excellent communication skills. If you send her a message, you definitely get a response soon enough. Answers to all questions, tries to help you out if there's any issue. Provides review tests for final exam. Gives a bunch of extra credits to do if you want.",1
"This class is amazing, very inspirational. The teacher really wants you to succeed. Uses blackboard a lot to explain homework and other materials. There is a heavy written assignment but he divides it throughout the semester. I would definitely would take Professor Beck again!",1
Such a great teacher. Super easy and everything is in groups. Everyone pretty much passed with 90+. He also does extra credit. Very nice teacher and always helps his students EVEN ON TEST. Easy A,1
"Requires a ""textbook"" and we use it once. Never responds to emails, you'd better hope you can figure your problem out. Assigns one long group & one long personal paper, that's all you work on all year. You need past turned in papers for future assignments but she doesn't hand them back or tell you your grade. Easy grader though. ",0
"If you don't like to talk in front of a class, don't take him. He gives over 100 problems for homework and the only way to get credit for the homework is if you go to the ""homework days"" in which everyone, one by one, has to read the question and their answer. If you get it wrong and/or don't fully understand how to answer it correctly he gets mad.",0
"I love Najar! he's my favorite teacher this year. Incredibly clear and willing to go over anything you might not have caught, and very interested in his students.",1
"This professor NEEDS to be evaluated by SMC + Scholars Program. Unaccommodating, inconsiderate, and unwilling to work with students to the extreme. When questioned, she spits back a condescending retort. DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR. CONSIDER SOMEONE ELSE.",0
"Write EVERYTHING he writes on the whiteboard! He is very particular in what he wants so make sure you cover everything he asks for.  Do all take home papers,  they seem tedious, but an easy way to get a 100 & count as a take home exam. He is all over the place & exams are hard, but he really wants to help you & gives you chances for retakes.",1
"Talks the entire class time, but nothing is learned. Will ramble on about nothing pertaining to the chapter, and gets aggravated when people lose focus. Seems scatterbrained, not focusing on the lecture.",0
Interesting guy. Manages to make subject slightly interesting and prepares you well for tests,1
"I don't have less respect for anyone else in the world than I do for this man. Both a horrible professor and person alike. Calls people out in class, chooses favourites, makes decisions based on punishment. Labs are purposely design for 8 hours, has no regard for the time slot, and will use labs for classes/midterms and still assign the full lab.",0
"If you don't put in to this class what you expect to get out of it, then you only hurt yourself. She is very helpful and tries to break it down to simple phonics. It is elementary spanish and I applaud her for trying to make it fun.",1
"Sat there like a rock, no advice, lowered grades for disagreeing with his interp",0
"Worst professor I've ever had. Went to every class & still had no idea what was going on. He teaches as though this is a review session, not an actual class, and doesn't move from his seat in the corner. When students address their problems in class, they are told that he doesn't know what to tell them and basically that it's their problem.",0
"Refuses to use D2L, off-topic rants in class, unclear instructions on homework and quizzes. Is an angry old man, should not be teaching.",0
"She's so great!  always helpful, always clear, always ready to explain something.  Fair, too.  I mean, the material's not easy, but when you actually study it, her exams are fair.",1
"Works very hard for his students, stays after school everyday to explain the material if you couldn't understand it in class. But he goes vary fast in his lectures and isn't super clear then.",1
Good professor for those who want to learn. Prepares you very well for midterm and final. Weekly quizzes help you to learn the material. Chance at the end of the year to make up quizzes. Very good teacher.,1
Awesome instructor; very enthusiastic; exams are fair (gave us the option of long answer question); great job of explaining patient presentation. Enjoyed the course!,1
he was not helpful at all. his exams had very little to do with what was in the book and on the lectures. i would NOT take a course taught by him again,0
"Traumatizing. Graded by 2 MTs & a final, but you won't have any idea what's on them since they never appeared in lecture or the textbook. Never fully erased the chalkboard. Spoke in ""proofs"" Refused to answer questions. Assumed we knew upper div math. Averages were 50-60 (which he said was good for him). Def run if you ever see his name.",0
"Never to take again. Gets upset when you dont understand something and expects you to know subject material before the class, even though you never know what that would be. Quizzes almost everyday and your grade is based solely on the tests and quizzes for both lecture and lab. Uses the book but tests are on what he says in class, none book related",0
"I strongly disliked his class. It was super expensive ($40 textbooks for one or two classes). It was confusing and seemed to have no relation to the real world. I know less about political participation in the US now after taking this class, than I did before. But now I know a bunch of useless models of voter turnout.",0
"Professor Amundson is clearly passionate about what she teaches. However, the lectures are super boring because she just talks, and theres barely anything to the sideshow. There is only a mid term, a final, and an essay, which are all difficult. If you love history then maybe this is the class for you, but if not do not take this class.",1
"Never prepared for class, could never figure out how to work things that he needed to use. VERY boring, and you only get good grades if you see eye to eye with him, not for what you see and can back up.",0
I will never pick this teacher again. Makes things more difficult than they really are. Places doubt in students instead of encouraging them. Adds more stress to lesson plan than there should be.,0
"Not very helpful in lecture, he rarely works all of the way through a problem, and expects students to be able to figure out the rest when it is often very difficult.  Tests were difficult, but the class is not curved.  If you take this class, do the supplemental instruction that goes along with it.",1
Phil is a funny professor. He would always use funny examples like beer or cigarettes to engage his students. Knows his stuff and if you pay attention and do the readings you will be fine. Only downside is that he is a hardass grader but he curves heavy to help his students.,1
"Is the worst stats professor at gvsu, take anyone else. She gives a quiz every week on material that's irrelevant to material taught. She treats everyone like children, lectures are god awful boring and don't help much.... Oh did your grandma die or did you get really sick well It doesn't matter because there are no make ups for test or quizzes.",0
"He thinks he knows everything, he kept interrupting me when I was doing my presentation. I felt embarrassed as he kept interrupting and he I ask him a question, he wont' answer it right.",0
"READ because literally everyone has to answer a question in class. Easy class but the book is super expensive compared to the other LIN4671 professor's book. She's super nice and adorable but she gets confused easily. Your grade basically depends on attendance, tests, and group projects. There is a tests every 2 chapters but they're not hard.",1
A God among men.,1
"I wasnt looking forward to Marketing Research, but Mike made it good. He is reasonable and at least tries to be funny. Overall it was pretty good.",1
Very nice lady! Always willing to help. Only has 5 essays in here English 101 class. Easy A!,1
"There's a lot of reading and experiment hours involved. Lectures are boring and tests are relatively difficult. But she's a nice person out of class, so she'll help you if she has the time.",1
"Dr. Ivanovic is intimidating with your first year with him, found that out during PHYS 1001/1002. Although, he grows on you as a lab coordinator. IF you pay attention to what he say's he's hilarious, and tends to be very nice if you supply effort.",1
"Professor Draper gives many hours a week for office hours. If you need anything from her, she will go out of her way to help you. However, she also expects her students to do the work. She works hard, and so must her students. The class discussions and material were insightful and thought-provoking. And she is especially knowledgeable about law.",1
"Very nice guy. However, he is extremely hard. He moves fast and expects you to understand and remember previous information. His writing is hard to read. Do no take unless good at math and ready to teach yourself. Buy the solutions manual if possible.",0
"Everything was graded by a grad student who ""taught"" us, attendance counted with the GA but not in lectures with Ball (lecture were pointless). I never studied nor opened the textbook and guessed on every online quiz (1/week) and online exam (2 total + final) and was fine. 2 group presentations, very unclear and no response to emails. Easy enough.",1
He was an amazing teacher.  He does not baby anyone in the class but treated us like the adults we are.  Notes are very important but can be found in book too.   his writing is horrible but easy to adjust to.  Overall one of the best in the department.  I will for sure be taking more of his classes.,1
"Don't buy into the ideas that are being taught just because he is a professor. Professors can be wrong. Doctors used to tell people that smoking wasn't bad for you. Transcend your white guilt. Transcend your ethnic victimhood. Shed the negativity and go forward with an open mind. Question everything, including the ideas presented in this course.",0
"Ok...yeah hard class!  Don't take if your looking for an easy A...getting an A in here is not very easy, if possible at all.  ATTEND ALL CLASSES or you will be really lost.  Half the time you will be really lost if you are there!  Overall, nice guy, knows his stuff, interesting, but the plot thickens and never really becomes clear.",1
"Mazi is an amazing lecturer. He did a superb job this year and was very organized. Dont listen to the haters, Mazi rocks.",1
"He's actually a pretty interesting guy, full of knowledge, definitely has his own way of doing things, grading is entirely based off of how you do compared to others in the class. You have to put a lot of work in but he's not nearly as bad as everyone says. Has a lot of insight into the chemical engineering industry.",1
"Her online lectures are very easy to follow. Get the red book. I liked her, but she has a strong accent so if you have an issue with that, then take another professor.",1
"I loved Laura! The class material is very challenging but she is great at explaining the concepts. She can get off topic easily and the first day on a new subject can be very overwhelming, but after a couple of classes you will understand with a little effort. Her tests are difficult but her papers are easy. Study for the tests and you'll be fine.",1
I absolutely adored Professor Martin! He is an amazing professor that makes an 8 am class very engaging! I would take his Irish Poets course over and over again if I could! There are three books for the semester and you will use all of them. The assignments and exams are easy! He gives you amazing feedback and help whenever you need it!,1
"This psych course barely discussed psych at all w the focus being on philosophy the entire time. Online notes are super hard to read because of an excessive use of emphasis on practically every other word. Tests were hard, and she's useless in office hrs, esp. if you're in immersion. Learned nothing and would not reccommend her to anyone",0
"Articulate, fair, hyper-observant, very smart and deliberate. Less intimidating when he's one-on-one -- in fact, downright sweet. An interesting guy. If you are experimenting in writing without conviction or commitment, this course will be hard for you.",1
"Would recommend her to anyone in a second. Not only is she a very good professor, she is always very pleasant and cares about how all students are doing in class. If you are having any problems at all she is more then willing to go out  of her way to help you out. I have taken two courses with her and would take more if I could.",1
"Her lectures changed the way I thought about English and life, and now, I am not scared of writing essays anymore. She gives all the tools to succeed and learn in the class. There is a paper almost every week, discussion boards and grammar quiz. She teaches you how to apply English in every aspect of your life. A life-changing class.",1
"I would strongly recommend going with any other professor for this class. Extremely random and heavy lectures, notes will be all over the place. Most of the tests and quizzes have questions either never covered, strongly opinionated, or way more specific than emphasized. No assisting material to study, expected to research unknown topics.",0
GREAT teacher. Torts can be a bit confusing so you must not fall behind. Start memorizing early on as he expects you to know every rule & policy verbatim or you will NOT get credit on his exams. Study his model answers & follow his suggested formating! You will be expected to know every detail of a case so don't skimp on briefs. You stand to brief!,1
"Interesting, humorous and straight forward teaching style.  Good lectures.  He chooses the exam questions word-for-word from a study guide - very fair as essay tests go.  He uses WebCT for reading assignments and to post grades.  I enjoyed the class even though POLS isn't my major.  Also, he's attractive in a intelllectual sort of way.",1
Lectures are long and often unrelated to the subjects. He goes off on tangents quite a bit. Just pay attention to ONLY the math examples he gives on the board. And as a side note: he will tell you to get the book because you'll need it. You don't need it! ,0
She is truly amazing! I was going through a rough time and I am not so great in communicating. She reached out to me because I wasnt turning in stuff on time. Didnt think shed care about my situation but she was extremely understanding and gave me the chance to make it up! She is also comforting! Overall class was great! Thank you!,1
"a lot of work, but it's worth it! she is truly an amazing teacher, makes it fun & easy to learn italiano! --she actually caes for her students!!",1
coach mandrell is very informative and brings humor to the classroom,1
"Very hard to understand, tests are not anything like the lectures, and the study guides he gives out are useless. There are a couple of map quizzes which are super easy and they bump your grade up a little from all of the difficult tests. I would not recommend this professor to anyone.",0
"best prof for bio 1m03. provides numerous info/resources to help you succeed. gives away pens if you participate in class. gives weblink project (if you do it, you get a reference letter). fair test questions, you can always make an appointment with her to discuss lecture related contents or participation opportunities",1
Dr. Lephardt is a great economist. She gives good examples about current events but sometimes drifts away from the subject and rambles on about random stuff for a long time. Long lectures.  Hard class makes you work for your grade. Gives good study guides on what is going to be on the test.,1
worst lab coordinator in the world cant even begin to explain whats wrong with her. if i had energy left from the 6 labs and 40+ hours spent on them i would be as passive aggressive as her emails are but here we are. pray for a good TA who doesnt dock marks for dumb things and remember! your efforts will not mean a good grade. not with this lady.,0
"He was very rude to students, especially if they had to miss class. His final brought many students down entire letter grades, and he didn't really seem to care about his students rather than his own personal agenda.",0
"One of the worst teachers I've had. Openly admits he doesn't follow the textbook, doesn't use slides and doesn't have a paper outline to follow while he lectures. The test is on whatever he says and he tends to drone on, skip around different years and is quite boring. He's nice enough as a person but he's past his prime when it comes to teaching.",0
"ORG BEHAV-- Barbato is the best professor I have ever had in my 5 years at RIT. He is down-to-earth, well thought out, and makes each and every student feel valued. The case studies he uses is the BEST POSSIBLE WAY TO LEARN. This course has taught me how to be a better leader, manager, coworker, and most importantly a HUMAN",1
"Interesting topic, but he makes it boring and even more confusing. Gives no feedback. Assignments are crammed and confusing. Does not help. Assignments will take forever, but only worth a few points. Avoid at all costs.",0
"Waste of time.  She is a great person and I know she means well, but I learned...nothing.  It was probably the most frustrating class I have taken so far.  This is supposed to be advanced grammar, yet the majority of the class was taught in English.  Her English accent is stronger than most of my classmates.  To get an A, take her. To learn, don't.",1
"First thought when I saw him walk into the classroom: ""Please don't die in the middle of the semester!"" Not that I'm saying age is a bad thing but this professor is older and hard of hearing. Tests don't match content taught in class. Best of luck if you take Cooper! You're gonna need it! One positive, he allows old editions of the textbook.",0
worst teacher ever and doesn't care abt students or what he teaches at all,0
He is really interesting to talk to he tells a lot of stories that actually tie in with his lectures. however if you get him started on a subject you will have spent the whole class going over it. he really doesn't expect a lot however he does expect you to pay attention. Test are a BEAST!! just know your stuff and have a passion in learning.,1
"Dr. Cook looks to be a good man, but his teaching style is despicable and unhonorable. Exams do not match the subjects, with averages around the 40-50s. His lectures are only him going over his notes from 2-3 years ago. And he says the only way to pass the class is to do the in-class problems, but it is total BS. Overall, DO NOT take the class.",0
"Lectures aren't lectures. Does problems going from A to Z but wont explain anything in between and if you do ask he just says ""well its right there in the problem just look""and thats it. Very boring. Lots of homework and random quizzes through out the semester.",0
"I took this class as a Hybrid course, half online/in person. I have to be honest, her personality is intense but if you get to know her, she's a sweet person. Just get your work done and don't miss class. Expect quizzes every week. The questions aren't hard, answers can be found directly in the textbook (even online). I recommend online.",1
"He told us on the 1st day of class that he was lazy. What kind of a teacher tells you that. He gets mad when the class did not get what he was teaching, and he even used very BAD words in class. NOT COOL!",0
"I took him for sociology 1301 and 1306. His class is extremely easy. I took one for summer and the only complaint is his syllabus layout. He organized his due dates by a day to day basis and not weekly which made things confusing. He's a little picky about grammar in papers, but not too bad. This was also an online course.",1
"This is a great online class. Candida is very good about making comments on assignments and gets grades back quickly. The class has about 3 assignments due each week but it is very manageable. There are 15 hours of volunteer work outside, but if you choose your location early it is easy to get done. I would definitely take a class from her again.",1
"He was a decent teacher, but I wouldn't take him again. He's very liberal and pushes his views on students a little more than he should.",0
To be honest she isnt very helpful and she can be very rude she gives out too much work and she gives out too many essays and she is very specific on what you need to do would i take her class again nah,0
"Paul is a super nice guy but you can't understand him. He doesn't clarify the projects. I took this cause I had to for foundations and I would NEVER do it again. You basically just do random stuff. You jump from project to project, sometimes 3 at a time and your always confused. He's crazy with the way he only cares about that class no other one.",0
He's a pretty rad teacher. Just do your reading assignments and you'll pass all of his tests/journals.,1
"Terrible professor. Was extremely rude to the class and his lectures were hard to understand because he only talks, no slides or anything. Try to avoid!",0
"When asked questions Professor Trefftz was very clear when answering them and didn't make the concepts harder than they had to be. Very easy grader, but still felt like I learned something. I'm already scheduled to take him again next year for a data structures class. Bonus points for being laid back and having a good sense of humor. A great prof",1
"It is unlike other courses, he allows you to question all the information given without the fear of being politically correct because the past is often discussed. He is not easy and tough grader, but that should not cause you to not take his course. Definitely recommend, you actually learn something. One of my favorite professors..",1
"Lectures are crucial. While attendance isn't mandatory, be wary of skipping. The tests are made up of lecture questions.   He's not a good test makergrader. Each test will contain several questions which he forgets what he said in class and then argues why 20 of us who wrote it down are wrong.   ",0
"This is an honest review. He is very nice, very willing to help if you show him you care a little, but is very unclear in his assignments, papers, and sometimes even exams. Its hard to understand what he wants from you, that being being said he is more then willing to help vis zoom or email. Very frustrating class to be in tho...",0
"Professor Sinniah will be the best and easiest Chemistry professor you can take at Calvin. His teaching style is spontaneous, interactive and crystal clear. He is also VERY FUNNY..with him, Chemistry is not difficult. If you study hard, you will pass the class. Also, with him, homework isn't mandatory!",1
Horrible Professor ! Do not miss her class for any reason or she will put you on academic probation. I didn't learn one thing from her class. It was a waste of time. I think I actually lost brain cells listening to her babble about her kids and useless references.,0
"If you're planning on taking a course with Brian Tansley, drop it. That's the best advice I can give you, unless you feel inclined to work harder than you ever have, scavenging for answers to questions that were hardly mentioned in class, only to receive a barely passing grade. Class average for the final was a 56. That speaks volumes about him.",0
Often unclear with her help (which I told her about..hopefully she changes).  A lot of time spent for a 100 level art class.  Mostly fair grader...mostly.,1
Great slides and goes over lots of example questions.  Knows his material very well.  Nice guy.  Good at explaining concepts.  Midterm and final weren't super hard but there were some challenging questions.  Thought that some midterm questions were a bit irrelevant (not what we learned or from Chem 112).  I would take another class with him!,1
"Although an absolute disaster administratively, Prof Mackenzie is one of the best lecturers I have had at McGill and also one of the most sweetest and generous. The exams were very easy if you went to class and took notes. He also provided and went through past papers that were nearly identical to the exams we had. An absolute gem!",1
"super knowledgable but lecture is just that: him talking the entire time. if you like linguistic anthro, be ready for way more ling than anthro in this class. readings are heavy, but not all are needed for the papers. had a great time doing the papers (your own research) and there was no final or midterm exam besides those",1
"hard to keep up with, but nice",1
She is not an efficient professor.,0
"He basically teaches and especially presents the test questions in a kind of cipher.  If you can learn to break it, the questions are then only time consuming (about as time consuming as it is possible to make them for the type of problem).",0
"You have a grade of 89.8 and he would round up down to a 89 for the final grade. He doesn't give your test back. His online test doesn't allow back tracking. Staff he teach, not so hard. The way he run his class? worst I ever had. DO NOT chose him!",0
"I'm not sure how Prof. Markwell teaches in a classroom, but it is a nightmare when online due to COVID. His instructions are unclear and he spends class time focusing on the wrong things. We would have several papers to write and he would give us an entire lecture about font usage. He seems pretentious and brings politics into the classroom often.",0
"completely useless, don't take any class with him, ever.",0
Handy is by far one of the best teachers in the business department.  Really helpful and understanding.  Works with ALL students.  Take her if you want to pass an accounting class!!!,1
Lives up to her reputation as one of the worst professors on campus. A good student with an interest in the subject will easily be disheartened by her teaching and testing. Northen should not have this professor.,0
"Frustrating prof. Everything he writes is full of typos and unclear expectations. Lectures were long and strayed away from the material. Quizzes were difficult, questions felt random. Nice guy but not great at teaching. Luckily he graded our final project and paper easily so I received a decent grade. Most of exam questions are exactly from quizzes",0
"Terrible, I mean terrible instructor. He is not clear at all when speaking and moves fast. He is of NO help when you ask him a question. He simply cannot answer questions. Gives quizzes no one is prepared for. You pretty much have to teach yourself which can be tough for Database.",0
"very unorganized course. the only hope you have is the final that tests your true understanding. The quizzes, even if you know all the material you cant do well. This is because the professor thinks because it is open book it needs to be more difficult. That too, with an extremely limited time limit per quiz. One of the worst classes I have taken.",0
"TERRIBLE. I didn't have a major, and she talked me into taking upper-level classes as a freshman, saying I didn't want to close anymore doors for myself. She talked me into taking Bio120 when I was in no way interested in science, and I got a D in it. She also made my schedule more or less by herself - I could have done that, I wanted ADVICE.",0
Summer classes. Just glad I made it out with a C.  I'm an awful  public speaker & he was no help. He would seem short/kind of rude when dealing with you. Expectations were pretty ridiculous/lofty. He was always sloppy & rumpled. Hard for me to take his pretentious attitude/poor criticism skills seriously if he has such low hygiene standards. Gross.,0
"Just to rebuff the last person, I had Joyce 4 years ago and those comments are ALL TRUE...he paid lil attention to me and beat up everything I did...I've been teaching 3 years now and nothing he taught me has had any real impact...and I've been a Teacher of Year candidate twice (special subject area and school level)...all by myself!",0
"She means well, but course work is too long and tedious. She added an extra assignment on when the syllabus said there would be only 10 assignments. She marks the tests much harder than assignments, which is fine if we ever got any feedback faster - but we didn't.",0
"Mr. Johnson , please go home your grandsons missing you a lot. Nobody should take any course with him either optional nor mandatory. Low voice, confusing, old fashion, no clear examples, showing slides... Ah SICK",0
"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!! Best decision you will ever make is to avoid this instructor! If you need the I/T class, take it with someone else! Online classes usually require more work simply because they are online but this lady takes it to a whole other level! If you are a FT student, better make sure your other classes are easy before taking her!",0
"Awful. Lectures are extremely boring, nit-picky grading and his attendance policy is ridiculous. You'll miss a quiz if you are a mere 2 minutes late. The wording in his syllabus also allows him to change your grade SIGNIFICANTLY according to attendance. I regret taking his class!!!",1
"Smart Professor but cannot explain the course in layman's terms. Try reading a bond primer before the course starts. Book is dry and not used too much. Just study the PP and lecture notes. Overall, Fin 485 is useful but Fin 450 is close to being a waste of time.",0
"I have never met a more condescending professor. He is not clear with what he expects. The tests are impossible. He is the worst professor I've had here and it has given me a horrible view of the music program since he is the chair of the department. As of right now, at the end of the semester, half of the class is failing. Do not take him. Ever.",0
"I usually don't do reviews but I really like Helen Acosta! I have 2 MA degrees and her class is pretty hard. I don't mean ""hard"" in the sense of tests but she does assign lots of homework. Ms. Acosta has very good lectures and really puts her all into them. She cares about her students. She does provide extra credit opportunities so take advantage!",1
Dr. Robertson is one of the best professors at Virginia Tech provided you like civil war...I love this class you really learn a lot and there are only two tests!!!!! He has so much passion for his subject and it really shows in his teaching....I ABSOLUTELY LOVE HIM and recommend his class to anyone even non-history majors.,1
Lets his classes decide when things are due and also lets the class decide when an amendment to a due date needs to be made. Unfortunately lecture is a part of the class you can't skip but he was entertaining enough to hold my attention through 3 weekends of classes. Fair grader with lots of feedback. Would definitely take him again!,1
The guy might know his stuff but expects us to worship the book. Gives quizzes all the time before we even go over the material. Grading scale is lowered to 85=A. Tests suck. Unless finance major don't take.,0
"While Dr. Grabowski is a nice guy, having him for OChem 2 is awful. His notes are incomplete so you lectures are mandatory. He sets up assessments that are comprised of two quizzes (17 points each) and the exam (66 points). The quizzes are always meant to trip you up. Averages are in the single digits. Exams are in the 40s-50s. I would avoid.",0
"I did my undergrad at YU then spent years in Michigan acquiring my Masters. As soon as I returned to Canada, I went to look for Dr. Malszeki. He was very brilliant and caring as usual but the amazing thing was that he did not even seem to remember what he had done for my life as a student. A genuine, once in a lifetime great pearl of a Prof. #1",1
Dr. Kelley is a overall good person but as a Professor she stern and the quizzes can be confusing and hard to pass. She grades her discussion boards thoroughly and harsh. Extra credit is hard to get as well. I cant recommend her for a 1010 class.,0
She cares about the material but she didn't really care about the people in her class. The handouts she gives on the first day of a new powerpoint are actually useful for studying for the final. If you actually put effort into knowing everything on the powerpoints you'll get an A.,0
He's actually kind of funny. Dry sense of humor. You need to take notes because his power points are all maps. Just write down the main points from each slide. Memorize those for the tests. Not a hard class. Just spitting facts back out. Got Bs to B+s on everything and after the generous curve at the end you wind up with an A,1
I have been out of Aquinas for four years.  I have gone to graduate school and have become a teacher myself and I stll think Eberle is one of the most interesting and inspiring professors I have had.  And he is sexy for an older man.,1
I owe Professor Pollock an apology. I was too timid to say it in person. I want to thank her for encouraging me to graduate program. When I was totally lost she sat down with me and encouraged me and told me that I was on the right track. For this I am forever grateful.,1
"Math 112 was super easy. The homework really helps, so do it. Other than that, just show up.",1
I had her at UNL. She is absolutely one of the most caring professors I have ever had! She is one of those professors who doesn't spoon feed you but she gives you the tools you need to succeed! As long as you do the readings and take good notes in class(NEED TO SHOW UP TO CLASS).  350 characters aren't enough to describe her. She's simply amazing!,1
"He is such a passionate professor, it makes the lectures amazing! Be sure to take notes, the exams are take home and open note, the better your notes, the better you'll do. Although he doesn't have an attendance policy, I highly recommend regular attending because you will get behind if you miss. I have learned so much in this class!",1
"JJ is so awesome, I seriously don't know why his rating isn't higher. His grading process is perfect, gives extra credit, exams are clear, he cares most about you ACTUALLY learning something and doesn't care about regurgitating facts, has tons of life experience, is easy to understand, and is kind of funny. I've taken all of his classes offered.",1
"THIS PROFS LAUGH IS HILARIOUS, PLEASE TAKE HIM, YOU WILL BE HAPPY",1
She doesn't know how to teach. She is a tough grader. She doesn't know anything about cybercrime except anything from the book. She claims she is a lawyer but doesn't know anything about cyber laws and such. Her exams are very heavy and tough grader. She expect a group presentation and final paper,0
"He is all over the place. Hardly ever assigns any work or lab reports, but don't take that as a good thing. Asking him for help is virtually useless; all he does is go off on tangents even when you're genuinely interested in the answer to the question you asked.",0
She is an amazing professor! Her study guides prepare you for the exams there are no trick questions on exams. She is willing to help you after class. Just make sure to read everything on the syllabus. And if you have a facilitation make sure you plan out the topic don't do it last minute.,1
SHE IS A NICE LADY.HAS INTERESTING STORIES TO TELL. HER CLASS IS NOT HARD AS I HEARD. SHE WON'T GIVE YOU A GRADE UNTIL YOU TAKE A MIDTERM AND A FINAL. YOUR GRADE IS BASED ON EXAM AND EXTRA CREDIT. NONE OF YOUR ASSIGMENTS ARE WORTH A GRADE. GOES TO FAST IF YOU HAVE NO CLUE ABOUT THE LAW. MIDTERM IS NOT FROM THE BOOK. KNOW UR COURTS. WOULDN'T TAKE!,0
"He has to be one of the best writing profs at GVSU.  His explanations of requirements and assignments, as well as paper feedback, are very clear.  Very patient and helpful with your portfolio, and he works with you to make sure you pass.",1
"Labeled an MBIOS course, but MBIOS was not addressed. This course should be listed as sociology/anthropology. The class only discussed topics like poverty, women's rights, and mental trauma. Teacher assigns a ludicrous amount of reading and writing. You WILL spend every night typing papers and reading about topics not related to MBIOS. Awful class",0
Theres daily readings for about 1/4 of the given book. Lectures were given by student instead of her. You may even be able to plagiarize as she lets it slide. Nothing is posted online so dont expect to keep track of it. Never went off the syllabus.,0
"Does know his stuff, but cannot explain anything. Read the textbook and really focus on the notes from class.  Bring a tape recorder if you can - it might make it easier if you listen to the class again.  Likes to talk about himself. Likes the pretty girls!",0
"Brilliant professor.  Professor Mahonâs breadth and depth of academic knowledge and extensive âreal-worldâ experience were just the background for this class - Entrepreneurial Challenges.  I learned more in this class than in any other, undergraduate OR graduate level! HIGHLY RECOMMEND ANY CLASS taught by him.",1
Doesn't teach anything he quizzes or tests you on. His lectures don't relate to the homework assignments at all. Had to teach myself everything for this class.,0
"I would not take her class. Worst teacher I have had by far, gives no direction what so ever and is not clear on anything. And she kicks so many people out of the class. DO NOT TAKE.",0
"Horrible teacher. Biggest B*$%#. Not helpful.  Looses work.  Does not want her students to succeed. Truly needs to be fired.  WVC should have no place for teachers like her, she brings the whole school down.",0
One of the best prof's I have had in Asper! Her exams are fair if you have read the material but are very difficult if you don't keep up! Explains everything and very approachable! Answers any question you may have and very accessible during office hours and other times,1
"Professor Hertog is a great guy, however his lectures were very dry and un-entertaining. There were a lot of group projects and papers. Taking this class wholly online didn't help either.",0
the worst prof. i've ever had,0
"Honestly one of the worst professors I have ever had. His lectures were incoherent and did not match up to what the assigned readings were at all. In a whole semester we barely got past the anatomy of the eye, did not learn any psychology. The only good thing I can say about him is that he let our class out over an hour early every time.",0
"Dr. Flynn is quite LITERALLY one of the, if not the worst teacher I've ever had. He does not care about his students or their well-beings especially during a pandemic. He is rude, arrogant, belittling, and overall terrible. I'm truly sorry for whoever has to take his class. He will grade you work for grammar instead of content. DO. NOT. TAKE. 0/100",0
"Great professor, really energetic and funny. The projects are do-able but you need to start early. Easy to do well if you use resources (TA, office hours) available to you. Tests are straightforward. No surprises.",1
"I do not understand those who do not like her classes.  I find her lectures very interesting, clear, and pointed.  She values student input and is very helpful.  I thoroughly enjoyed this class!",1
"She is always getting off-topic, always talking about her personal life (cats, health, friends, etc.), her class notes are so unorganized and hard to understand (so many grammatical and spelling errors it's kind of ridiculous). This course would've been way better without her as the prof.",0
"Amazing teacher! Class can be very boring at times, but overall an easy class. If you show up and do the homework, you'll do great!",1
"One of the worst professors I have had! She's a very nice person, but completely disorganized! Takes the first 20 mins out of each 50 min lecture to talk about her twitter and yet she wonders why students don't come to class- she has absolutely no self-awareness. This class isn't that hard, but it is a TON of work - avoid if you can!",0
Lectures can be pretty boring. Tests are long but are marked fairly but even when attending all of the lectures there were topics on the test that were skimmed over in the lectures. Definitely would recommend sitting near the front of the class as it seems like he gives preference to those students.,1
I chose this upper level Forensics class because I have a certificate in it from community college. I was hoping to expand on what I learned but that really wasn't the case. I mainly passed through using my notes from my forensics lower level classes. If looking for the basics on Forensics I'd suggest this professor's topic forensics class.,1
"Was confusing during lecture and didn't give much of a holistic view of social psychology. Trailed off a lot, didn't give clear expectations and was somewhat rude when evaluating essays. Topics and movies he showed were somewhat interesting, but I didn't learn much. Didn't communicate well either.",0
"Dr. Auer is the best! At first I was a little skeptical because he was a little goofy, but he ended up being a great teacher and made math fun- who knew? There wasn't much work outside of class at all and he was a very fair grader. He takes time to know all of his students and their interests and has so many great stories. Would 100% recommend him!",1
"Hands down best prof at Bentley. He absolutely loves life and accounting. You would be crazy to even think of taking anyone else. Class is 50% exams (midterm final) which are challenging, but the other 50% are easy assignments that are easy 100s if you put a little effort into them. Study for his weekly opportunities.  ",1
" all you have to do is pay attention, no hw, and everything do with calculator. all the tests are multiple choice    ",1
"Alonso makes this relatively easy class practically unbearable! She is very unprofessional, and gets enjoyment out of pushing her extreme feminist views on EVERYONE. And if you dare not agree with her opinion, be prepared to lose points for it! She assigns work due over Spring Break too and gives NO second chances so be warned. AVOID THIS WOMAN!",0
"Barb is a great prof in and out of the class. She made the material easy to understand and was always willing to help. As long as you keep on top of the assignments you'll do fine. Assignments may seem a little teadious, but are easy marks. Final exam on the computer was a little tough though.",1
"Good prof, assignments were somewhat challenging, but exams were relatively fair and easy. Knows what she is teaching, friendly, helpful in office hours, very organized notes. But if you already have some grasp of the material, her teaching can be rather boring. Good prof.",1
"Yes, finally a real college professor.  He will drive you nuts with all the material.  Then have  test questions geared towards some super Jeopardy of history game.  You will study until your hair hurts & pray for at least a low C on your test.  Then when you feel all hope is lost of maintaining a scholarship the curve will hit & all is okay.",1
"She was a great teacher! She made sewing really fun and interesting for me. But if you miss one day, it's easy to fall behind. ",1
"The reading material this professor requires is outrageous. There was no textbook for my course by he posted 10 or more articles a day that he expected the students to read. Some articles were as little as 5-10 pages but many were 20 pages+. If you have the option to take another professor, I encourage it!",1
"This man has pushed me farther away from engineering than even my parents' disapproval ever could. He has made me question every decision I have ever made. With his boring voice that is enough to put an insomniac to sleep, I've been unable to focus in any class. He is the WORST professor I've ever had, and that's saying something. Take it at a CC.",0
"Hes a horrible teacher, he talks to himself, stares of into space and he writes the ""book"" for the class, so you're pretty much screwed there. He wont clairify anything, mostly because he doesn't know what he's talking about. But if you memorize everything...the class isn't so bad. because thats all it is. its not practical applications...",0
"horrible teacher. Doesn't teach Humanities, but instead rehashes all his philosophy rants and creepyness into a clutter of a class. Any other teacher for Humanities is the way to go.",0
This class is very interesting. He will teach you more about the South than you ever want to know!! One of the best history professors I have ever had. Highly recommended,1
DON'T EVER TAKE THIS PROF'S CLASS. EVER. THE WORST PROF,0
"She is one of the best professors at UCR. Her class is very hard, requires a lot of effort and you cannot miss lecture. The tests are Hard but she drops the lowest one. The group paper was a mess, but she's stated she'll never do it again. It's an upper division class, so expect a lot of work, but you'll also learn a lot.",1
"Worst Teacher EVER! Not recommended of your trying to learn something. He doesn't care for his students and he is super arrogant. I turned all assignments in and received a bad grade, even though I have always had talent in writing. He is what I call a hater. A total jerk and the most self centered teacher I've ever had. Total fail ! I REGRET IT ! ",0
"I was not very impressed with the PowerPoints she put up on the course for our lectures. I have seen a lot better from other online learning platforms such as Coursera. And that is free.
 Overall, she is not a horrible professor but not a great one either. Pretty average overall. Recommended, but with reservations. Mostly because of her vagueness.",0
"Shes a little nutty but the class isn't difficult. If you just do the homework which is easy, and study the vocab here and there you'll do fine. If you Hebrew school growing up you will get an A.",1
"Not interested in helping students, more interested in being a gatekeeper. Rude and mean-spirited.",0
"Good professor with good lectures.  No online notes or solutions, so it's imperative to attend to class.  Hard, but fair. Can get a good mark if you try.",1
"He certainly knows the material, but he tends to over explain concepts which I struggled with. I wouldnt recommend. Tests are nothing like homework and each multiple choice test question is worth 3 points.",0
"In the beginning, Mr. Franks is intimidating and is a hard ass, but he warms up within the first few weeks. He is very funny and very understanding. There are only 3 tests, and 2 papers for grades. No quizzes or homework. But make sure you bring in an article for every class! He gives 5 bonus points to final grade for articles.",1
"For the first time in my life, I understood Math! I felt she was an excellent teacher!",1
"The hardest class I have taken. I asked many questions, but the answers were always convoluted and unclear. The guy does try, but we just speak different languages.  I spent days on the assignments just to earn miserable points. I was sure I got all the questions on the final, but he gave me an F. Btw, I got As is most other classes, but failed his",0
"funny guy, fun lectures, very accomodating, office hours are helpful, homework is hardddd af which is where i think most kids complain about, but they're not worth alot so even if u miss some pts i think ur good, quizzes and final are pretty easy, time consuming class for sure",1
very funny teacher a must have for english funny and like to go class getting him next semester,1
Is nice professor but his voice bores you and his lecture is a recap of the reading mostly but you have to go to lecture or else the final will be impossible.  His essay choices also aren't very straight foward they are kinda out there. Okay teacher but I wouldn't take him again,1
"Jp is so bad, more than Half of the class dropped.",0
"He's such a nice teacher, very helpful and patient especially during office hours. If you make an effort and seeks for help he is going to take that into account.",1
Only take if you have to,0
A lot of reading/ homework assignments but the class is overall amazing . His lectures make you pay attention and his voice is not monotone.,1
Very unfair.  Favored males.  Egotist.,0
"Ended up taking a minor in Political Science just to attend more of his classes. He's hust brilliant. A committed civil rights activist and engaged empirical political scientist. And he's fair, offers extra credit, and makes lectures interesting with some humor. Will support you out of school, and has a lot of advice about publishing your research.",1
"Very educated in the field she teaching in, which helped us understand more clearly and get higher grades. Had her in my Inro To Business, she had an outstanding ability to explain. She's helpful and entertaining.",1
"Although Lamont King seems passionate in what he teaches, he speaks very slowly to the point that the class is quite boring. he is not clear on instructions so its best to ask him any questions... there is also no rubric for any papers you do or quizzes, etc.",0
"Stay away from Donna, she is extremely rude. For being a communication professor she is does not come off as a nice lady. Would not recommend her for anything.",0
"This professor doesn't curve the test or do anything when the class average is below a passing grade than tell you to drop the class, no extra credit or anything. So if math doesn't comes to you easily then this teacher isn't the best teacher for you. You can be dropped from the class because of attendance but it is not apart of your grade.",0
"Dr. Mirsurda is really passionate about the material, but I don't think he relates it to the students. He doesn't give a lot of homework so I you don't do well there isn't much of a buffer. He often speaks the whole lecture, so it's hard to follow for 75 minutes. He often gives snarky responses to the students when they ask questions.",0
He's kinda boring.  Acutally pretty boring and his syllabus gives you no direction whatsoever on what to read and when.  He usually takes the full class period and at times goes over.,0
"This class was done before thanksgiving break, which I appreciated. The only assignments he gives are biweekly discussion boards and quizzes, then a test every few units. You don't have to read the book, just reference for quizzes and tests, since they're open book.",1
"The man teaches class with his eyes closed half the time but he is a genius. He's out there but you got to respect everything he says, and the TAs are helpful and are the ones grading your weekly papers. I got an A so it's not impossible.",1
"I LOVE ADRIANO. I had him online this semester, and he was the best. He is so caring and made class enjoyable and interacted even through zoom. Homework is not that bad either. He ended every zoom with ""Have fun, be safe, and don't drink"". I love this man!!!",1
"I had him for lab, and I must say he is one of the worst professors I've had the displeasure of knowing at this school. He spends the first half of lab talking, and if anyone asks him a question later on he snaps and them and says they didn't pay attention in some previous lab. He is arrogant and obnoxious, and he'll mark you down for anything.",0
"I felt like overall she ok: she would help with comprehension if you were lost and she seemed to know what she was talking about. However, she had a certain one-sidedness to her and had a certain hiddenly derogative way of putting down people who didn't agree with her view on subjects misusing terms like common sense & intelligence.",1
"Unethical!  Lowered my grade when I challenged him about it!  Rude, condescending, arrogant and I could go on.  Don't take his class.  I did not feel comfortable in his class as he liked to berate many students.  You won't learn much and you will dread going to class.  UD needs to investigate this one.",0
"The professor never uploads her slides onto Sakai and doesn't even post your grades up online. Each quiz and exam is packed with too much material to memorize, and the lectures are long and boring.",0
"So disappointed. It's not even the fact that all the tests are on the lockdown with the webcam and she is super strict on her assignments but with the covid situation, we had our last exam pushed in time and 2 days later a comprehensive final exam?! ( super hard) Maybe give us some time to study? It was ridiculous. Also, weak communication (blb).",0
"EASY A, but he did pick on me alot through out the semester. He seems unhappy in his marriage and belittles you when your proud of your happy marriage. Like I said, EASY A, and gives extra credit as well as extra redit for attendence. Also, no need for book..",1
AMAZING PROFESSOR! IF YOU DON'T TAKE HER YOU ARE MISSING OUT!,1
To all who read this realize u are a student and as such u need someone who can convey the subject matter clearly.Dasner does NOT.He knows the material but seems frusted he never became a famed intellect.Study the book because his lectures cover the subject lightly.Ask questions even if he ridicules u.Either he's lazy or doesn't know how to teach.,0
"One of my favorite classes so far at WSU. He is always very welcoming when it comes to questions or any misunderstandings. 2 papers, 2 exams, and a weekly response every week, but the responses are 34 page max. both papers were super easy, exams a bit more difficult because they are short answer questions (still manageable). ",1
Jenny is a neat woman and she definitely made class interesting. It was nice to have a professor who understood that this class is most likely not in any of our majors and so of being really harsh she did her best to make sure we could choose to learn the content in an interesting way without destroying our gpa.,1
"If you pay attention in lecture and browse the readings you'll do fine. I didn't read everything required and I ended up with an A in the class. He just wants to see that you listened in class and that you have your own opinion on the topics. Only graded by the three exams (including the final), so study well for those and you'll be fine.",1
Fuhrmann is a complete quack job! He is like a mad scientist and his tests are ridiculous. He straight up lied to me about my grade also. THIS GUY IS HORRIBLE! AVOID!,0
Could not ask for a more caring professor. He really wants you to learn and gives lots of positive encouragement. I have never had a teacher care more about their students than professor Austin. Lots of in class participation is needed with weekly quizzes but everything helps learn the material. Homework isn't terrible. 10/10 recommend.,1
"First of all, she was hard for me to ask questions to. When I did, I felt like she was talking down to me. She assigns homework but never actually looks at it and if you don't pass her tests, your chances of passing the class aren't good. Not a chance in hell I would ever take her again.",0
Very crude and demeaning to her students. If you go to her for better clearity she will send you away by telling you to re-read the book. On emails she replys with the least words possible giving no clearity of your problem. She isnt there to help her student suceed but to be a obstacle for her students to get over. Only professor for the course,0
"I enjoyed her class. She is very nice and caring. Her class is not hard, just be sure to participate. The only thing that is a bit complex is her test - they are very structured and shes a tough grader. But overall the class was laid back with not a lot of assignments.",1
"I've heard quite a few complaints about Harkins, but overall he is a good teacher. His grading is a bit tough, but he just wants to teach his students how to write a proper essay. Plus, he is always available for instructor conferences and will tell you exactly what you can do to improve your writing.  And his sarcasm is hilarious! ",1
He is the best,1
"Takes attendence way too seriously for a class that isn't reliant on it, which is why I dropped the course. An interesting man with lots of stories (and magic tricks!) to share, but a tough grader and unclear about what he wants on assignments. Not recommended.",0
Take every chance you get. He helps with anything and everything. Honestly top 2 best professors I've ever had.,1
"Tries to be funny a lot, and askes whether everything was understood.",1
"SOOOOOOOOOO boring, I wanted to die with this class. Lectures are long and homework is hard and he basically never gives A+'s",0
You have to read a chapter of the textbook and a whole play each week and have weekly quizzes. There are also 2 critiques and a group final project. She takes attendance everyday and it does affect your grade. She is a hard grader on the group project. I would recommend taking a different class to fulfill your fine arts credit.,0
"The experiments are quite interesting and I enjoyed working on them.  However, if you encounter some sort of issue, Prof Ho will be of ZERO help to you.  I dont think he spoke more than three times the entire semester.  Youll have fun working on his required 50 page lab reports - any less and he wont even consider giving you a grade above 80.",0
I had grammy for both econometrics and economic development. Both classes were fairly easy even though they were both deemed extremely difficult. He is the most organized professor at csub I have ever had. I would recommend you take econometrics with him because he structures the class to the student's advantage. There is lots of reading though.,1
"get ready to teach yourself, because she is sooo bad at teaching. She gives quizzes and tests literally every day, but barely explains anything. I do not recommend her class",0
"Oh boy are you in for a treat! Not only is Dr. Bellantoni an awesome professor, he's a real stand up guy. His charisma and his mustache will make you swoon and wish you weren't wearing any pants. If you're taking class with him, you better be ready for the time of your life!",1
"Hardest class I've taken. Almost nothing covered in his lecture is on the test. you must rely on the reading for that material. Loves talking about himself. If you can teach yourself, then you can do well.",0
Hardest class I ever took! I dont know how people do well in this class. So much to read! I read multiple times and took notes on everything and would still fail tests. He gives so many tests!!!,0
"no in class instruction, but will help.wants students to work in groups to ""help/teach"" each other.  dropped him right after first class meeting",0
"Lectures make no sense, good class to do other homework in. There's a lot of assigned reading but I'm pretty sure no one in the class ever took it seriously, sparknotes helps a lot. Just go to class and leave halfway through and you wouldn't miss a thing. As long as you write good papers and have a general knowledge of the text it's a guaranteed B",0
Easily one of the best teachers at TCU.  He actually cares that you learn the material and does a great job of keeping the course interesting.  If your an Econ/ Business major you need to take him.,1
"Just don't. She made the class WAY more difficult than what it should have been. She went on the most random tangents I've ever heard, fussed at a student who was two minutes late and told them not to knock on the door if they wanted to enter (I know right?), and was just overall a little off. A plus is that she was always available if you needed.",0
"He is very nice and helpful. He likes to stand in front of what he is writing on the board, so it is sometimes hard to follow his lessons. Once he started teaching things that I didn't learn in high school, the class got a lot harder and I felt like he wasn't as good of  professor. ",1
Professor Pearl is a great professor and I would recommend. He clearly outlines everything and gives the student everything they need to succeed. Would definitely take him again!,1
"Great professor, but don't expect an ""easy A"".  His classes offer a tremendous workload on two not so easy topics.  He can be offensive if you take it that way but he's just being facetious.",1
"The lectures are a joke. Everything is based on the experiment readings that you do outside of class (or you're supposed to do). She is so nice and means well, but she talks to you like you're 3. All tests are essay and can be intense, if you don't read.",0
Super nice and chill.  A little but of a weirdo but he's just passionate about science.,1
"Dr. Ferrari is very funny and entertaining, but his lectures can be a bit much for someone (like me) who isn't always in the mood to participate and just wants to go to lecture, take notes, and leave. The tests were easy and he'll even let you retake one if you mess up. He's a pretty good professor, just not going to be everyone's taste.",1
"Took him for animal science, awesome instructor, very knowledgeable and funny. Kept lectures interesting.",1
"You can barely understand what he is saying, because of his asian accent. He is VERY dry, & his lectures are painstaking. His tests are ridiculous & even if you study, his questions are so tricky it doesn't matter. Take the OTHER astr professor who teaches 121. For NO OTHER astr 121 class is it required to take a telescope lab except for this one.",0
"This terrible prof will make things very hard and unpleasing for students. She is rude in class, avoids students questions, Tests and quizzes are EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. She will test you on things that aren't covered in class and makes her tests auto graded and doesn't give option to view when asked. don't believe me? look through all her reviews.",0
"I also took 211 and 322 with German. German is the most empathetic professor I've had at IU. Whether it be explaining complex topics or helping with assignments, German is always willing to go the extra mile to explain things. He is a great professor and an even better person. There is a lot of work, but most of it helps you learn.",1
"He's a great professor! Lectures can seem a bit monotone but stick it through, it's worth it! If you go to lectures and listen you'll do fine in the class.",1
"Melanie was the actual best. She wants you to succeed in a creative writing course. I could not recommend her enough. She wants all students to feel comfortable and is so genuine. You write three major assignments; poetry, fiction and non-fiction. She wants you to succeed! Would love to take another class with her",1
The things he teaches in class are not very clear sometimes. He just ask you to memorize the fact.,1
"Content was interesting, besides the fact that the entire course grade is determined pretty much by four things. Be prepared to read three very heavy chapter books from the early 20th and late 18th century. Stay away if taking online.",0
"Professor Clarkson always sounds like she is on the verge of tears. This is understandable, considering the subjects she teaches are mind-numbingly boring. Math isn't my strongsuit (like most students in Great Ideas) however, she doesn't really care. She fails to explain most things well, and the homework goes well beyond the lectures.",0
"Took Prof. Sabau for Fundamentals of Math. Reasoning and his class was a breeze. Attendance is not mandatory but if you skip, you may miss out on a lot of important info. He gives a lot of extra credit opportunities .",1
"Professor Henderson is the greatest teacher I have ever met, Her personality is everything, she's so energetic & makes the class fun, I took her class online my first year at CWU and I was very impressed, She makes her lectures easy to understand, she responds to emails on canvas very fast so If u decide to take her class ur going to be blessed:)",1
The worst college experience of my life. Pages upon pages of homework each night - prepare to live and breathe Spanish. Don't take this class unless you don't mind being called stupid and drilled on your Spanish knowledge in front of everyone. AVOID AT ALL COSTS! And DOES look like Clint Eastwood (which is a shame because I like his movies).,0
THE COURSE IS JUST AN EXTRA ANNOYING LOAD TO A 7.0 COURSE LOAD IN MY OPINION IT SHOULD ONLY BE STUDIO LABS ALSO THE GROUPS SHOULD CHANGE FOR EACH PROJECT YOU WILL HATE YOUR LIFE THIS COURSE IS ANNOYING,0
"Tests are the only graded assignments, & even though they are open note & book,  can be impossible. Some of the questions seemingly can't be answered using the given material. He is not flexible or helpful when technical problems occur, & it's an online class! I have been nothing but frustrated this entire semester, & I'm on the Chancellor's List!",0
I took this class online. She didnt write the lectures or the quizzes/tests and that fact alone is absolutely ridiculous. I emailed her several times throughout the course to understand trick questions and she would say that the concept had been taken out or it WAS a weird question and still wouldnt give credit. Too tedious.,0
"MOST BORING PERSON TO EVER LIVE. monotone lectures are better than white noise for sleeping, reads the textbook, and does exercises, no initiative to ask students if they're learning, don't even read the chat if people have questions! HW and Exams are via 3rd party. no need to attend cuz he can care less how many ppl join, hell teach an empty class",0
"The lectures aren't important, if you have google you're fine. He is a great guy and he doesn't grade harshly at all. Just a lot of homework, especially at the end.",1
GREAT PROF!!!Do some work and maybe the tests wouldn't be that hard!!!!Must pay attention and take good notes and study for the test,1
"I thought this class was fun and informative.  I had low expectations at the beginning, but I loved this class and I'm glad I took it.  Super easy, small paper and exams weren't bad.  Prof Blackman is really kind and knowledgeable, but she is a little scatterbrained.",1
"Rodgers was not a good professor . He was constantly off subject during class, then rushed new information in the last minutes of class. Tests and homework were nothing like material learned in class. Rodgers was inconsistent with assigning labs & grading any assignments throughout the semester, making it hard to know your grade until after finals.",0
My favorite professor ever :),1
"Strange format for teaching. 4 take-home tests due every six weeks or so, if you get more than 12 correct u get 10 pts, less than 12 you get 0. In class tests given same day you hand in take home tests, so you don't know if study material is correct or not. This class can be easy as long as you stay on top of reading. 2/3 dropped by semester end.",1
"He'll walk in, smile, say good morning until he gets a grade school like response then turn around and be degrading towards his students.  His labs are will take way mopre than the alotted 3 hr period and are barley worth anything.   He is intimidating,acts like you are attacking his knowledge when you ask a question.  Generally useless.",0
"Lots of reading with an extremely high vocabulary, & are controversial & boring. Short replies that make you feel stupid for asking questions. High point quizzes that contain large essays that are due in 4 hours once opened & you can only open these ONCE. Very strict, unreasonable, & hypocritical w/ deadlines (modules taking forever to be updated).",0
"Was very clear in his lectures, 4 chapter tests and one final. Mostly based on his power points but does throw in facts found in the book. DO THE EXTRA CREDIT EVEN IF YOU HAVE AN A, you will thank yourself later! EXTREMELY EASY A CLASS, if you actually study for tests. : BTW, he is HILARIOUS and always has a real life example for EVERYTHING. ",1
Awful. All she does is talk about her dogs. Cant lecture and pretty sure she doesn't even understand stats.,0
"I am a very active participant when it comes to classes. He dissuades you from wanting to do that. The lectures are long, incoherent and have nothing to do with what you are reading. My advice is to read the textbook, study the many quizzes he gives you for the exams and sit in the back and do homework for other classes.",0
"Although Dr. Rankin is super friendly and nice, my mark rested solely on the midterms and there was no assignments where we could improve our grade. The midterms were incredibly difficult and focused on minuscule details from lectures. The midterms were very hard to complete in the time allotted to us. I would not recommend this course :(",0
"Dr. Brown is an amazing physics professor. He's very passionate about what he does and loves teaching physics. His lectures can lose people at times but he gives tons of materials that will help you understand. Daily lecture checkpoints, homework, and exam reviews are all very useful. The chaos theory part of the class is very interesting as well.",1
"Horrible Psych experience. As a PSY major, I wanted to learn from interesting reads + classmates. Instead it's ALL text book and extremely difficult gradng. Tests are 100 M.C ?'s very hard stuff. WOULD NOT REC. Not a good Psych professor at all.",0
She's incredibly mean and selfish.,0
just don't do it. It unreasonable difficult and the workload is insane. six books for 14 weeks of school??,0
"Bogdan is a great teacher who really knows his stuff. Hes a very relaxed teacher and his lectures are great. He is one of the best professors that I have had, if you have the opportunity to take his class take it",1
My first essay was a B+ and no matter how much I went to the Writing ctr I get the same grade wc is frustrating she's really nice and kind you have to participate in class and AVOID being late bc she doesnt like it the only thing w/her is w her esay instructions its quite confusing and no matter how you change the roughdraft its the same grade,0
"3 exams, 3 labs that's it. The labs are left to the TA and you learn them the day of, so pray you get a good one. The exams are 90% of your grade and the class average is less than 50. He'll never through anything with you or helps but instead keeps telling you to work harder. He curves the course but only at the end, so you have to wait to know.",0
"He was really understanding when it came to deadlines. As long as you have a valid reason, he gave you as much time as you needed, given you don't abuse it. He marks fairly, a bit on the easy side, but like any other English prof, he's tough on grammar and punctuation. He enjoys a good sense of humour in your writing.",1
"Good teacher,with sense of humor always willing to help.Some things are a bit harder than others but all in all easy to comprehend.Does alot of extra credit which helps at the end of semester,so attendance is important.Does not like if your tardy and will not accept late homework.",1
"Worst professor ever, does't care about students, gets mad if you ask him questions, quizzes are graded unfairly, he takes off points if you dont answer them his way, boring ass lecture, I had to teach myself everything, DO NOT TAKE CLASS WITH HIM EVER!!!!!, he needs to be fired from teaching",0
Ms. Smith is really easy to get along with. Listen to her lectures and review all of models she shows in class. The tests are challenging because there's a lot of material to cover. She's easily accessible outside of class and will thoroughly answer any questions you have. One of the best teachers I've ever had.,1
"she is incompetent, period. You learn nothing from her classes because she doesn't know anything and doesn't teach anything.  On top of that, she is not enthusiastic and is so extremely disorganized. Her wild favouritism and completely random objectiveness in marking will drive you crazy. I wouldn't waste my precious money on her class again.",0
"Dr. Konen is a really nice professor that makes the lectures easy to listen to and the environment easy to be in. Attendance is non-mandatory but if you want to pass the tests, which I found to be very difficult, you need to attend the lectures and take notes. He rarely assigned homework but it was easy and I found his study guides useful.",1
"I took HUM5 online during fall 2020. Prof. Terry changed his requirements for discussion board posts listed in his syllabus halfway through the semester, marking down grades. He does not offer lots of help. Directions on assignments need clarification. Super reading heavy, but if you do the reading and watch the films, you will pass the class.",0
"He's a really nice, generous and helpful guy. Makes the occasional joke in class. Goes through material somewhat quickly and isn't always clear in answering questions. Review session before final hurt more than it helped. Overall a good class and a great guy.",1
"Professor Pangallozzi is a knowledgeable professor, but I felt the class was disorganized. She was definitely very busy and was not easy to get in touch with. This class was online, the course might be more organized in person.",0
"Wonderful teacher who actually cares about delivering the material! VERY tough grader and picky about perfect attendance as well as on time to class, this can get annoying, but she means well and her method of teaching gets the job done.  You will learn a new set of 20-or-so vocab words everyday, so expect to work hard for your grade.",1
"I've never met a professor who absolutely refuses to answer emails before. Sure, a few might take longer than others. But to NEVER answer and then blame you for misunderstanding something? She's ridiculous.",0
"Very knowledgeable teacher, but easily off topic... ALL TIME",1
"He doesnt normally teach this class and you can tell. He was a bit disorganized and sometimes confused himself. But other than that he was a solid teacher, taught what we were suppose to learn and was helpfully when asked questions. All around a pretty decent dude.",1
Quizzes and exams are hard. All of the assignments are all rushed together. Most confusing class I have ever taken at UNA. ,0
"Goes over material pretty fast.. you can do well in the class if you read the book thoroughly and study a lot. The TA's were pretty horrible, and I'm pretty sure they made up the midterm/final...",0
"Arrogant attitude, not worthy of a professional",0
Rick's a great professor here at DePaul. He clearly knows his stuff though can be hard on some students. Never skip class (news quizzes every session) and do what is expected and you should be fine. Expect your homework to be covering stories around campus or the city and it being time-consuming. He's very professional and offers some great advice.,1
The worst. So rude when I saw her in person and extremely condescending. How people like her are profs blows my mind.,0
"I had Dr. Lewis for the Communities of Engagement FSEM and she was a great teacher. The class can be a little boring and slow, but it is a great way to learn about the Fredericksburg community. Dr. Lewis is very easy to reach by email and is very accommodating to her students. But if you want to get on her good side, make sure you participate!",1
"no extra credit, so many useless papers, and sometimes rude to students. Ultimately, she tries to ""leave an imprint"" on her students, but it just is annoying and weird. I would recommend taking another professor for EN 102 because honestly she is annoying. Also, doesn't use blackboard for grading which is also annoying.",0
"Tom was wonderful, he let me swap into his course after the deadline and remained understanding with my struggles of balancing multiple language based courses at once. I did end up not continuing with Linguistics, however this was at no fault of his. Tom, if you are reading this, thank you for being patient with me throughout 2018-2019.",1
Have no idea what he talks about.,0
Great class. Great Professor. Highly recommend ASTR 330 (Extraterrestrial Life) as a gened!,1
"He's fairly good at explaining ideas and concepts, and if you pay attention it will definitely make sense. His tests are really difficult considering the homework he gives is a joke (usually 10-20 problems). Even a lot of the book problems are easier than his test questions. Go to CLAS at least once a week and office hours and maybe you'll get a B.",1
"She is a very nice person in general, but she is not the best grader. She takes a while to give you your scores back. But she doesn't believe in late work and let's you turn in assignments up to three times to improve your score. He talk a lot in her lectures that seem to go in one ear and come out the other.",1
Dr. Halaby is awesome. He tries his best to answer questions and make the class interesting and applicable. Make sure you read for the quizzes.,1
"I do not reccomend taking her, she never knows where you are at in the class / grades, test are at a doctors level since she use to be a doctor  she expects you know everything right away. Does not go in order, make sense, and like no extra credit. Your grade is pretty much on your tests & our class averages were never over a 60%! Good luck",0
"Not everyone like Prof. G, but I did. He's a nice guy, and he's pretty funny because of the way that he rambles sometimes. He's definitely passionate about what he teaches, but admittedly, his course isn't the best organized. If you're trying to choose between FYSs, I'd definitely recommend this one, because it's crazy easy.",1
"The 40 year old virgin.. is possibly the worst math teacher anyone has ever had. The homework is ridiculously impossible, he goes off on tangents and makes no sense, and his tests are insanely hard compared to his lecture notes. All in all, just buy a gun and kill yourself if you're in this class b/c you're dead anyway. ""The wiki is quiet lately""",0
Id for sure say stay away from this lady. Shes in her own world and struggles to communicate with the class so she talks extremely slow and it takes about 5 minutes to get out a sentence which can be very frustrating to listen to... overall not enjoyable class so much busy work,0
"The class is more of an art criticism class. Most class periods were not painting. We listened to her slideshows for many class periods, and when it was time to paint she wouldn't let you start painting unless she liked the idea herself. Made me feel bad about myself as a painter. Pushes her agenda on you. Take if you like abstract art.",0
"Ms. Fox is an amazing instructor. She's prior military and that helped me a lot since she uses some military language  in her class lectures. She expects a lot out of her students, and she can always be reached in her office or by email and responds to emails in a timely manner! I learned more from her in two weeks then I did in my ENG 101 class.",1
"She is actually one of the worst teachers ever. Some people like her, but the honest truth is that she is very selective and cruel. If you ask for help, she will get angry/upset and tell you to find the answer yourself. She makes the class more difficult than it really is. Try to get a different professor. Her husband is MUCH better at his job.",0
Never showed up to class and I passed.,1
"Professor Irwin's class was one of the more difficult classes I've taken. Prof Irwin is very distant, not helping students when they need it and retreating to her desk after giving her lecture/labs. Her grading is unnecessarily meticulous, penalizing even a slight spelling error. You will receive a zero with no chance of make-up if you are absent.",0
"Professor Schaffer was a very difficult teacher. He lacked in the teaching part and was unclear when assigning homework, DB, and case studies. Even though he was caring, I feel like he didn't have a balance in his teaching. I agree that this is college and studying is part of what you need to do, but he was excessive.",0
"So in the beginning I thought this was gonna be hard... but I ended up passing with an A and in flying colors!! Honestly, extra credit and assignments is a must if you want to pass. He's kind, generous, cares about you. The emails are sometimes delayed but I can't complain.   Just do the work and don't drop. Most did and missed out in the end. ",1
I would NOT recommend taking his class. Maybe the first two days of class is good only. If you make it to class 4 minutes late you won't be able to get in. Which he has just arrived 2 minutes late. Tough grader. Doesn't give feedback on essays. Expects you to know your errors. No enthusiasm. Lectures feel like you'd rather be somewhere else.,0
"She can be extremely hard, rude, and she'll force you to be meticulous. She only GUIDES you through the course material and will NOT break it down to an easily understandable level. With that being said, Lutz has been the greatest contribution to my engineering education. Although you will hate life in her classes, she'll make you a great engineer.",1
"Professor Liu was really nice, and I liked his lectures. I would really recommend attending live lectures compared to recordings because recordings take time to be accessible. Prof. Liu provides us with his lecture notes which are extremely helpful and a must-read. Overall a really good Prof! He made math seem a little less scary which is a plus!",1
"Poole is awesome. As a science major, I was uneasy at first taking a Shakespeare class- but it was amazing. She kept class interesting, was helpful, and valued input during class discussions. Also, exams were really fair. If you don't mind reading Shakespeare- TAKE HER!",1
"AMAZING professor.. simply amazing. The tests come from the notes straight up, and a few questions from  the reading. But you don't even need to read the text, just read the book of assigned articles.. the study guide will tell you EXACTLY what terms to know from the text.. if you do this, you're golden. She's such a cute dresser too! GREAT!!!!!!!!",1
"This was my first time ever learning java and she did an amazing job at teaching it. Amazing professor. Attendance isn't mandatory but you'll probably end up failing if you don't go. Textbook also isn't mandatory but it helps sometimes with the assignments. Attend ALL classes, Put in the work and you get your A.",1
"WOW this class is pointless. I don't think I learned anything.. I don't even know what the heck information systems are. Clay is a nice guy, but lectures are super boring. Tests are practically impossible, no study guides. Ended up with a C.",0
If some of these people who rated Dr. A low would show up to class consistently they would not have problems.  Her class presentations and lectures are spot on and well thought out.  Show up and you will pass. ,1
"She is the worst professor I have ever had. All her exam questions are trick questions; since her grammar is poor to begin with, this makes getting an A very hard. Put of a class of 60+, we averaged one or two A's per exam. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!!",0
"Not a good lecturer at all. He mostly faces the board, and goes really fast. Homework is worth a lot and graded for accuracy, so make sure you're getting all of those problems right. The tests are based off old exams and the homeworks, but are generally still really difficult.",0
didn't enjoy the idea of only 3 exams being the only grades for the semester. topics are difficult to comprehend. exams are confusing. lots of reading. nice guy and enjoyable to listen to stories he has in class. wish there were power points to go along with material.,0
"He makes an easy class seem confusing. He goes on random tangents about his wife and kids, and you never know what is test material or is just a story. Go to the study sessions, and keep up on readings bc some test ?'s come from out of the blue. Dont bother reading the novels, just sparknotes them!",0
"She's a very caring woman who lectures a lot, but she is literally the sweetest. Participation will get you through that class as she asks a lot of questions to reflect on ourselves. There's a reading after every class for hw. One must participate. Don't use phones/laptops cause she will call the class out on it, which is understandable. 100%!",1
"If you have Temple the best advice I can give you is write down everything he does in his lecture notes. It's the only thing you'll be tested on, don't bother with the textbook or AATC tutors, they can't help. I asked if we could have a practice midterm and he said, ""no I've never taught this class before so I don't want to make 2 exams."" Uncaring.",0
"Terrible, doesn't care.",0
"Had him twice, found his teaching style to be unique -he just tells you how things work in plain English.  I think I've used more of what I learned in his classes than most of the more theory-driven drivel.",1
"Amazing Professor - super engaging and funny, knows a ton about the subject. He's wicked flexible, and will often grant extensions for the entire class unasked.",1
"Dr. Pastorello is greather lecture style isn't particularly unusual, but she's highly educated and very clear about her expectations. The course grade is comprised of two exams, a research paper, and participation, and she hands out a study guide for each exam. An A is easily in reach for anyone who can write well and attends/participates.",1
She isn't well versed in using canvas so she wont work with you when it comes to accessing materials online.,0
"This professor is clearly not in touch with the students, he's more concerned about his daugher's volleyball tournaments. Plays favorites in class, is moody and inconsistent. Too bad he made tenure, he may never be replaced.  Be honest students, you know you only take him because you have to. Could there be a more unprofessional teacher?",0
Definitely the worst prof I have so far.  Extremely unorganized notes and did a poor job on explaining the notes.  Exam covered materials not taught in class.,0
"Takes attendance every class. Lectures tend to run upclose to the end. He's old school - no powerpoints, no use of iLearn whatsoever so you are unable to access any of the pictures or info that he shares. He speaks monotone. Seems grumpy all the time. Handwriting illegible.  I boughtused the Red CR.  Midterms: A-, B+ Overall Grade: B+",0
Terrible terrible prof,0
"good professor.  The book is not needed as the exams are over the lectures.  The final grade is a combination of 4 exams and attendance, so go to class.  If you're looking to knock out a gen-ed I would suggest him.",1
"Would NOT recommend taking any class with Eric. He does not teach well, few examples, would rather talk about off subject topics. He will grade you well if he likes you as a student, otherwise you fail. One of the worst professors out there.",0
Professor Shearer is a good guy and he wants everyone to do well in his class. Was placed in this class with no interest but managed to get through it.  Assigns a few response papers and three or four essays.  Overall would not take unless you really like european history.  Not hard to get an A on assignments. ,1
"she doesnt grade anything, the rude TA does, then doesnt give feedback. Also returns grades back super late. Weekly assignments, seems easy, but have to read 5 articles and watch a movie for 100 words. Worst 100 level class I've taken.",0
"Professor Spearman is overall a good professor but the content overload is unfathomable. She expects students to know every single quote from every single novel we have read throughout the semester. If you can memorize every poem, break it down to your own comprehension, you can pass. Majority of the readings are boring and pointless.",1
never,0
"When I attended SMC in the early 90's, Niemi's classes had very interesting content. However, he is a complete condescending literary snob. The man is sinister and very demeaning. He slays students with brutal grading. I've taken 2 of his classes and got an undeserved D & C. He even called my buddy ""Bub"".When it comes to being cool, Niemi's a poser",0
"Edward is a great Professor with clear guidelines about coursework. He will assign the readings which are a lot and you will really have to read because test include lines from book or texts he assign. Managed to get a good grade but only with alot of work. Go to class for short answer questions preperation. Also, participate!!",1
This prof literally teaches NOTHING. Like the majority of the lecture she spends taking about useless unless unrelated topics. Her class notes are horrible because nothing on her notes are actually on the test. You HAVE TO READ THE ENTIRE TEXTBOOK to do good. She does bonus questions on what your TA's master/PhD topics are. HOW WOULD I KNOW THAT,0
"Dr. Novotny obviously loves to teach, and will do anything to help you do well.  All the good things you read about her on this website are true.  Highly recommended!",1
One of the best professors I've ever taken a class from.,1
Just avoid him if you can. You'll be spending all your time doing homework and studying.,0
Bob really gets to know each and everyone of his students. He wants the best for your future and will help you every step of the way. Great man.,1
"Has written books on AutoCAD. Knows it inside and out.  However often rambles in class about it and is not organized on due dates.  We have ""exams"" that have material we've never covered really. Very interesting subject and tool but he returns drawings with inconsistent grading and feedback. More clarity and this course would be legit.",0
Great Guy. Very knowledgeable and passionate about economics. Exams were relatively easy with minimal studying.,1
"Expect to put in 40 hrs/week average on homework. He demands a LOT, and 90% of people this this class at least twice. You just have to get on his good side, and go in ready to work. Despite all, I liked the material and he's not unfair, just very demandin",1
"Horribly disorganized assignments, an outdated and strange outlook on security against other coders working with your code and the inability to see when she messed up in created said assignments.",0
Literally the worst prof for online classes. He seems nice but I studied my head off and still got a bad mark. He has almost no practice questions. Just a few practice midterms. His organization of the class was the worst. His questions didnt reflect the depth we learned it in. Zoom sessions are useless. So try to learn everything on ur own.,0
"If you struggled with orgo, don't be discouraged! 425 is much better! Get the book to do his EC. It can bump your final grade by up to 5%. He's a good lecturer & lets you look at your old exams. People say he teaches similar to the ACS. That's a lie. Exam 1 is a lot of chem but bio comes in after that. Go to class for the notes!",1
"I asked the professor to extend some assignments due to me getting sick with the virus, and he did not extend all assignments which cost me my grade. The exams were not multiple choice at all and the class average for most was 50%-60%",0
"this guy is ridiculous, i have no idea how he became a professor. goes off on tangents. often confuses himself about the material, making things even worse for the students. says some really stupid, ignorant things. thank god for my wonderful TA, dave torres, who actually knows how to teach. read book to get a good grade on exams!",0
"makes a lot of unfunny jokes which come off as mean especially to students, goes off tangent often in lectures, feedback isn't helpful, readings assigned are difficult to write on for his expectations on essays,",0
"Do not take this professor, especially if you struggle with chemistry just in general. She will not help at all, not lead you towards the right direction, and does not at least try to help her students become better. Don't bother trying to go to office hours, so just save yourself the grade and choose someone else.",0
"She's a great lady! Stout's only NATIVE teacher. Born and raised in Chile but speaks more than fluent English as well. Highly reccommended if you actually want to bust your balls and LEARN SPANISH, instead of just getting Spanish credits. (if all you want is to pass, take Dr. M. Wallen).",1
"At first, Admiraal seemed tough, but after the first couple weeks of class I realized she is a sweet old woman. She genuinely cares about you how you are doing. There were daily assignments, but they weren't hard. Admiraal was very accessible outside of class. My writing improved a lot and I have used many of the skills I learned in other classes",1
"I do not recommend him. His lectures do not reflect the test questions, and he is not clear on assignments. He uses the iclicker technology so he can get input without having to hear his students speak. He's the kind of professor who knows he should care about students, but he doesn't. He should work in the private sector instead of teaching.",0
This professor is very informed when it comes to first hand experience and is enthusiastic but I found her lectures dull and not very helpful. You have no idea what to study for the exams and its a lot of material. She is a very tough grader and seems to pick favorites. I don't feel as if I have learned much but gives lots of extra credit.,0
"second writing course, 2 exams, one big paper that is broken into multiple parts, she is super sweet and actually wants her students to do well, second time taking her and she is great!",1
He talks way too much before each lab on content with no relation to the work he has you do. This professor also grades very specifically and is not fair/equal on his grading.,0
"Terrible Professor. He gives a bunch of busy work, gives terrible directions on the assignments, and is very unprofessional. His feedback is awful and I did not learn a single thing about either one during the course. Do not waste your time with this dude. Worst professor I have EVER had. I didnt think a university professor would be this awful.",0
"She is a great person & tries her hardest, but she doesn't seem to know what she is talking about. She gives handouts & study guides but doesn't really teach/explain them well (test come from these). If you like to teach yourself she is the teacher for you. Her tests are fairly simple if you take her handouts & learn that information out the book.",0
"He has a large ego, an ugly attitude, and is hypocritical in his writings. He tends to lead students on that they're doing a good job but then gives an undeserving grade. His assignments are synonymous with his writing guide, but there is no stylistic leniency - it's his way or the high way. Voice comments can be helpful, but emotionally stressful.",0
"Very easy class, but make sure you actually go to class.  And get started early on the group project and you'll be fine.",1
"Her class is hard, but as long as you study for every test, it should be easy to pass.",1
"Final exam this semester was absolutely ridiculous. Probably the hardest exam that I had ever written in my entire ECE program to date. Very difficult grader as well, he does not spare those part marks!",0
Doesnt teach Bad,0
Great class!  He was a great professor.  Make sure to do the reading!,1
how is it going,0
"""Sooby"" is the worst professor myself or any of my classmates have ever had. Don't even try to ask a question in his class. He will basically shut you down and ridicule you in front of the whole class. He sends out rude emails, passive aggressively threatens students with their grades, and talks down to everyone. Also his website sucks! AVOID!!!",0
"Wow, what a joke. This guy is horrible. Changes his mind on everything from day to day. Makes fun and insults people who do poorly on assignments and/or do not understand the material. Told the class ""if you don't understand my lectures, don't come to class!"". I honestly can't explain in 350 characters how big of a jerk he is. Avoid him at all cost",0
"The hotness, yes, made this class so much more bearable.  Did an admirable job of making a dreadful class interesting.  Tests were very easy, they're just short essays.  He doesn't really give much homework, but you have to write 2 short papers.  Grades easy.",1
Unorganized. I came back from all the classes confused. Reading the textbook helps because he basically teaches according to it. I find he sometimes pointed out helpful tips if you know what he's talking about. However he's funny and cheerful so going to classes weren't that bad. Many errors in the practice problems. Be sure to check the answers.,0
Terrible professor. Becomes side tracked really easily. Often didn't come prepared to class with a lesson plan and made us sit there with nothing to do until the time ended. You can tell she loves English but she is very unhelpful and you do not learn anything.,0
"Not the most cogent lecturer and a very harsh grader on homework assignments and exams. That said, perseverance can enable you to do well in his course. Just be sure to rely on Paul's Online Notes as a quintessential supplement to his lectures (which are incidentally copied and pasted from your textbook). Eastern style of teaching/grading.",0
"Not a bad class if you like Roman Archaeology. If you have little interest for the Romans or Roman Archaeology then don't take it expecting it to be an easy A. He's a nice guy that gives good lectures, but they aren't recorded so you have  to attend lecture in order to get the info. There are a lot of assignments.",1
"I'm terrible at history so I was unsure about this class. One of the best decisions I've ever made. Laura's passionate about her work, knows what she's talking about, and is able to teach it to others. A great lady!",1
If anything class moves too slow for me with too much explanation and I get bored and start to draw.  Dr. Meehan is an excellent teacher though.  Take her over others.  Dr. Oross is awesome for psy too!  Dr. Meehan has an easy course with the only complaint ever heard is that too much explanation goes into very basic things.  Keep it up Dr. Meehan!,1
English 101: I will no take him again. He can't give feedback and has a very hard time explaining what he would like from you in your papers. I had to asked him for an example of a college thesis for the first 2 months. Also he takes way to long to grade paper. It took him a week to grade 8 days to grade a paper that was required to be done in 2.,0
"He breaks concepts down in a way that helps a student like me (who has trouble) understand things. He constantly reiterates things so students understand thoroughly. He is super eccentric and talks about strange things at times, like a stereotypical higher level math teacher. But I honestly thought this was funny and made the class less boring.",1
Very open minded and deep lectures; I would recommend her as a professor to everyone willing to become more educated on gender studies.,1
boring to listen to but has interesting material...VERY dead-set in her ways and sometimes all over the place.  Overall pretty decent.  Fair exams.,1
"Unless you are majoring in philosophy, it is highly suggestive to not take this course. For a gen. ed req, the work is overpowering as well as difficult. Not everyone could grasp such concepts so easily, and she is very critical with her grading. Tries too hard to seem like a good prof. when half the class is complaining that they are failing. Sad.",0
Very opinionated and this has a major impact on your grades for each assignment/pop quiz.,0
"Alan is the best professor I've had so far. Extremely knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the material he teaches. He genuinely cares about student success, so he offers extra credit opportunities and is pretty generous with his grading. I look forward to having more classes with him in the future.",1
"Simply put, probably the most incompetent person I've ever met, and yes I am comparing her to every single person I have met. Avoid at all costs",0
I am now in my 3rd or 4th week of this course and it is by far my least interesting and least engaging class. It is close to impossible to understand what he is talking about due to his accent and general lack of ability whenit comes to explaining concepts. Seems like a smart guy but not an effective teacher by any means.,0
AMAZING prof. Cant wait to take more classes with her. She is incredibly fair in both her teaching and her marking. Very clear and easy to learn from. One article due per class and multiple films - loved the discussion portion and I usually hate group work. Very intelligent and well read about these topics. Would highly recommend.,1
Luke Galen knows the material and he keeps his lectures pretty interesting. I would definitely not take him again though. There are few things that are graded and the midterm and the final are the only exams and theyre extremely tough.,0
"She's a nice person, but I feel like I didn't learn very much in her class.",1
"Took 101A and 114 (Greek Myth & Lit) with this crazy guy.  Loved every minute of it!  He's into the subject, helpful, if you ask him to review your writings... DON'T PROCRASTINATE.  Some assignments may look easy in the beginning of the class, but be c",1
We were suppose to have mini quizzes about each reading. Right before the final she decided to cut them out of her grading criteria. I needed help with an essay and scheduled a meeting with her. She cancelled last minute and when I emailed her my question she didn't respond until the day before it was due. She was also late daily and unorganized,0
Seriously one of the best professors you will ever take. A little crazy at times but cares so much about you as a student. Will help you further in your career how ever he can.,1
"She is absolutely not professional at all! She brings in her dogs to class (who are harmless, by the way) and she doesn't always teach you how to complete an assignment- she just gives the assignment and tells you to do it. The worst part of the class is the big portfolio you have to do. It seems totally unnecessary and it's not explained in class.",0
Ali is a suspected Arson and Slumlord. I wouldn't take a business class from him,0
great teacher. very helpful.  loved his class.  He will make you work for an A.,1
"HARDEST 100 LEVEL COURSE  HE EXPECTS WAY TOO MUCH FOR EACH EXAM; THEY ARE ALL CUMULATIVE, CONSIST OF EVERY KIND OF QUESTION.. SHORT ANSWER, FILL IN THE BLANK (NO WORD BANK) , MULTIPLE CHOICE, TRUE FALSE QUESTIONS SOMETIMES DONT EVEN MAKE SENSE  ALL MEMORIZATION  I DONT EVEN THINK HE  WOULD PASS HIS OWN EXAMS  FINAL IS THE SAME FORMAT ",0
I have to say that Dr. Feagin was great for me. I wish I had taken her in my first history class. She was very helpful and very responsive when I emailed her. The quizzes are on the easy side but the midterm and final format were tricky. It had fill in maps and fill in the blanks along with some multiple choice and T/F questions. Overall great!,1
"Great professor. Really knows his stuff and really wants his students to do well. Material can get confusing which doesn't help when it's 8AM. Thankfully, all of his lectures are recorded. He tests right from his notes. Do well on the first 3 exams so you don't have to take the final (which is cumulative)! p.s. the answer is horseradish",1
"Don't take if you're not good at math. She doesn't teach. Her goal is to answer questions for 20 minutes then have you work with your peers to figure it out. She won't explain any concepts. You will learn by reading the book. She is soft spoken and will put you to sleep. No study guides cause that's ""baby sitting"". TOTAL MATH NIGHTMARE. BEWARE.",0
"closed minded and not helpful- Announced to the class that ""white people steal everything from us."" She was very offensive and only accepted her opinion. CANT STAND HER",0
"Hes pretty great, he gives really interesting lectures.",1
Hes a cool guy and seems like a nice grandpa but I felt so stupid in class. Every time I asked a question he responded with a question so I didnt get much clarity. Its easy to get lost but he does give points for pre-class assignments and our tests were open note and book (a book which he contributed to) which was extremely helpful.,0
Really funny and laid back guy. I loved the class and was never bored. I definitely want to continue with HTM because of him!!,1
"Unless you're someone who likes to regurgitate the class discussion in your assignments, don't take Camp. He doesn't allow research or information learned outside of his class; if he didn't say it, he won't grade it fairly. Nice enough guy, but god-awful teacher.",0
"This class made my day! His lectures are so interesting, however many think that you can do well on the test without reading the textbook. Some of the questions on the midterm and final are not covered in his lectures. This class was easy and a great learning environment.",1
Liked to go on long oral strolls 10 minutes past when class was supposed to end and would all but threaten you with academic death if you left before he finished. Very short tolerance for the slightest hint of stupidity.,1
"Hultin tries, but OCHEM 2 will kick you in the pants regardless. Such a difficult course. His explanations tend to turn into a bunch of electron drawing structure mush and eventually you just zone out and gain nothing from the lecture (or at least thats what happened to me.)",0
Not clear lectures. Study the exam reviews and you will get about 90 out of 100 in the exams. Only even-number questions are graded. Easy A!,1
"KMac's lectures are boring as he takes very long to explain each process and he usually does a lot of errors in his calculations. However, he clearly knows a lot about statistics and that's nice. Don't expect your midterm grades to be returned. We're already entering second semester and I still don't have my grade...",1
"Amazing professor. Had her for engineering 102 and I wish I had taken her for 101. This class was not super easy, there was plenty of work to do, but she made it interesting and was really helpful with anything I needed help with.",1
He would have us read every chapter from his book and had quizzes each week which was over the book but you had no clue what the questions were going to be. His questions were hard to understand bc you wouldn't know what he would want out of it (like statements). More you spend the better your grade! He is a hard grader. STAY AWAY.,0
"The class (ACC 201) is straight forward, assuming you come every day. The content builds on itself. If you miss a class you have to make sure you do over the notes but he will do problems in the near future and if you can do those you will pass with b+ or higher.",1
"The only reason I'm passing this class is due to studying with quizlet and studyblue. Prof. Glassman is NOT a good professor, his video lectures are long and boring, and his tests are only over the stories he tells during them. There is some extra credit and the 20 article summaries are ridiculous and 4% of the final grade. 10/10 not recommended",0
"this is a tough class, you really have to be dedicated in your work to pass. Getting an A isnt impossible since i surprisingly got one. LOTS of hw. She talks fast in lec but go bc participation points could add into ur final grade as EC. 4 lab and lec tests. final isnt cumulative. study guides dont really help. good luck!",1
One of the worst teachers I've ever taken. Too many assignments for an online class. Too many small things you had to complete in order to get your real work done. Too many things due at once. Too many things due back to back. She was really rude when you did reach out to her. She just didn't care.,0
Taking this class during covid 19 pandemic. His setup is a camera pointed at the whiteboard. It is constantly unfocused and he stands in front of his writing making it very hard to take notes. I contacted the engineering department to help set him up with a digital whiteboard and was told he had one and didn't want to use it.,0
"Great teacher. Funny, nice, and clear. Minimal feedback is given, but she does grade relatively quickly. put in the work+ easy A+. BUY YOUR BOOK ON EBAY FOR $5 AND DOWNLOAD IT INSTEAD OF BUYING THE $70+ TEXTBOOK. It is needed, but online is just as effective because you can copy and paste quotations. overall easy class do the work, get results.",1
"she was a really hard grader and often confusing. never clearly explained the assignments and if you asked questions she never gave a clear answer. crazy work load too, my other classes suffered as i tried to keep up and she takes points off your assignments for no reason and no explanation",0
"Though attendance wasn't mandatory, the lectures make more sense if you go rather than looking at the notes online (those are just an outline of what is covered in class). Otherwise the class is fairly straightforward and simple.",1
She is a super tough grader and enters no grades in the grade book so you don't know what grade you get in the class until the end. She gives everyone C's for no reason.,0
"Dr. Crawford makes this class harder than it needs to be. While I ended up with a B in the course, I certainly had to work hard to earn it. Reading the text everyday, attending every lecture, and doing tons of practice problems help. His little quizzes aren't many questions so they can KILL your grade quickly.",0
"Good teacher, great intro to logic.",1
"Cheap textbook, responds timely, and gives good feedback, very organized and straightforward, but holy moly so much reading, papers every week, tough quiz almost every week. You will have to read an entire book and then some. However if you put in the effort, I believe it is recognized and you will recieve the grade you work for. Planning is HUGE.",1
"I was excited to take geology and now I dread it. She's not the worst teacher; she has a few good moments but don't take her if you can avoid her. The homework takes me two hours and no matter how long I study, I can't pass the tests. There is also wayyy to much work for a gen ed class.",0
"It's a pretty easy and straight forward class. All tests and quizzes are open note and open textbook so many people in the class often underestimate how much they should prepare for a test or quiz. My advice: answer the questions in the back of each chapter and highlight the answer in your textbook, it helped me A LOT.",1
"Everything was outlined in the syllabus at the beginning of the semester. For online students, it is important to make notes of all of the deadlines. I had a few work obligations that made it difficult for me to complete an assignment by the deadline and she worked with me so that I could get back on track. ",1
AVOID THIS CLASS. He honestly gives so much homework and expects you to follow his answers word for word. He makes you read the chapter in the book and then you are allowed to revive lecture videos afterwards which I think is ridiculous. This is honestly the worst class Ive taken and I regret doing it online as well.,0
Moshe Barach is such an inspiring speaker. He brings so much energy into each lecture that he makes the class interesting. The material also changed my view on business strategies and I learned a lot of important concepts. This is an I-Core class so it's nearly impossible to fail but it's really hard to get an A. Just keep that in mind.,1
"My favourite prof at X. Dr. Watt really knows what she's talking about, and she explains it in a way that makes you understand it. Nothing she says goes in one ear and out the other, it's all interesting and important! I never wanted to miss Dr. Watt's class. Can't wait to take more courses with her!",1
Class was extremely hard for an intro class. Expects a lot whether you wanted to take the class or needed to fulfill a gen ed. There were 4 oral exams the whole year and a test/quiz every week. She's always open to making appointment but no one ever takes them. Nice lady but once class starts hopefully you know Spanish cause youre going to need it.,1
he does not care whether students understand or not. He does not know how to explain himself in a clear way.,0
I LOVED LOVED this teacher! Would take one of her classes again in a heartbeat,1
"He is the comedian of the MSE department. Likes to fool his students and talk about his life all the while to have a good laugh. There is basically zero note taking in class; what you wrote down won't make sense later. Showing up is optional. Read textbook, do examples. Tests come with equation sheet and mostly are textbook based.",1
"Dr. Airhart is symbolizes what is wrong with Houghton College.  Pretentious, elitist, but with nothing to show for it.  He doesn't get what Houghton is about.  Do yourself a favor and take someone, anyone, else.  Like so many others, he ruined my freshman year.",0
Prof. Henderleiter is a very enthusiastic teacher and she shows you that she cares about you and your grades. She definitely makes you work for your grades and her tests are fairly difficult. I am a mostly A student so ending this class with a B- was quite a let down. I could have probably tried harder though.,1
"Attendance isn't mandatory but you miss pop quizzes if you skip. Lovely instructor but the information can be confusing especially online when its difficult to pay attention. She is very sweet, a bit funny, and kind enough to help when needed. Would take again but in person.",1
"Professor Winogora is the best. He tries his best to make the class fun and engaging, while encouraging conversation. It's a fun time, and he doesn't penalize you for having opinions if you can back them up. He gives an assignment for every class, but they're usually short and just help you keep up to date with what's going on in class.",1
Teaches the bare bones of Econometrics.  Doesn't give much work but still teaches material well.,1
"Dr. Capozzi is the best! Class was cancelled about once a week, and we only had about 5 quizzes (many were take home) and about 5 labs the whole semester (only 30 minutes long too). He made one test and the final take home. Tests came from his notes and he gave you the equations. ASK HIM QUESTIONS DURING THE TEST Plus, he made Physics fun and easy!",1
"Excellent professor.  Class can become long at times, but then again, what history class doesn't?  Some complain about the level of difficulty of the course.  The work load is fairly light, the difficulty comes from the amount of critical thinking nee",1
By far best professor I have ever had. She holds you accountable and will make you work for it however in reality just pushes you to be a better student. LOVE HER,1
Contradicts himself throughout the semester and makes it impossible to write the 3 five page essays that count entirely as your grade aside from participation. Better options for the 100 level philosophy requirement as far as professors go.,0
"She speaks in all Italian so being in 101 I was completely lost throughout the semester. She is a really sweet lady but I never knew what was going on. Quizzes are weekly and she tells you exactly what will be on them. No tests or midterm, only the quizzes and a final. If you're taking to really learn, don't take her. Otherwise its an easy A ",0
Dra. Betanzos is one of my favorite teachers. She cares about her students and makes a real effort to make class fun. She also seems to really enjoy what she does and is genuinely interested in what she teaches.,1
"3 exams, basically gives the answers to 75% of the exam, the other 25% you can google on quizlet. Textbook mandatory for HW. Honestly, his accent is really bad. His handwriting is equally just as bad. Nice professor. Encourages students to participate. Loved his positivity during these hard times. Tried to do his best with what he was provided.",1
"Johnson is really cool. I had my doubts about this class but he makes it a lot of fun. Expect lots of class discussions with very few actual lectures. There are three papers, a midterm, a final, and some quizzes spread throughout the semester. The papers aren't that hard and he gives you clear instructions. Would take again.",1
chances of passing depends on how many lectures you show up/pay attention to. exams aren't too difficult. get ready for in-class discussions with random people.,1
"The professor does not even teach in class. He plays PowerPoints that are on blackboard (why am I even here) with his voice pre recorded, while sitting in the back of the classroom. He refuses to use Quizlet, APR, or work with other professors. Only study material are slideshows online you have to print off and learn from on your own (goodbye $)",0
She's great. Well versed in a variety of subjects. Gives specific and insightful comments on papers. Really good at leading class discussions and always willing to help if you don't understand a specific topic.,1
"The class project and the textbook are not related .The examples provided for the class project are just other student submissions, not actual requirements or guidance. The feedback he provides is condescending and vague. Even worse, he grades ""from the hip"" rather than from a clear rubric. I am here to learn, not just get a grade. Avoid!",0
"She assigns way work that involves us meeting outside of class times.  She is also not sympathetic or understanding at all.  She also teaches the class as if everybody already knows what she's talking about, and for those of us who have no experience with Hawaiian history/language/culture, she moves awfully fast. It just was very disorganized.",0
"This is the most arrogant, conceited, awful prof I have ever had. I only attended class because participation matters, always dreaded going. Make sure you are paying attention, because the second he notices you look away - he will put you on the spot. Don't even think about disagreeing with him. If you are shy and don't like talking in class AVOID!",0
Cohoon is a great guy who really wants you to learn CS. He grades leniently and has his own methods of teaching that I think are more effective than the other CS teachers' methods.,1
"She is very passionate and knowledgeable about this subject. Her lectures are never boring and always have lots of discussion. She incredibly sweet, but has very high expectations of her students and their work. Big group project over the course of the semester, but manageable. Very simple exams, but definitely need the textbook to pass the course",1
"Looking at the comments, this professor must have changed over the years.   When I had him many years ago, he was absolutely horrible.   He did tell some funny stories in class, but as a professor of history, he was lacking in many ways.",0
"Dr. Burridge was fine but this class was definitely dreading. A lot of reading every week, an analysis assignment per week, and the final paper was killing me. This semester was additionally hard because he didn't allow us to choose topics for our final paper.",1
"I found Dr. O to be knowledgeable humble. She shared past experience,current and relevant events every week which made class relatable to real world. She was a tough grader but provided feedback so one wouldn't make same mistake in future. I said she is humble because she is Program Chair but she related with us as class instructor so we learned.",1
He's the best!,1
"Pretty good professor, he doesn't use powerpoint so be prepared to write down what he is saying. A Midterm, 3 7-8 pg papers, and discussion. He's impartial when it comes to teaching the material.He's not conservative, if people went to his last lecture he revealed that he supports unions and that he thinks the Tea Party's popular is exaggerated.",1
"Just really annoying. He doesn't know how to spell and he is the head of the department, so he creates the labs and assignments but doesnt spell anything correctly on those. He is also really boring in class and goes off topic all the time.",0
"I thoroughly enjoyed Caneday's class, and he did a great job at explaining the importance of learning language. On top of that, he is super reasonable and is great at explaining the meaning of various rules. He is also nice in that he doesn't make you memorize every grammar rule, he just asks that you understand them.",1
"Joyce Young was fair and balanced, yet tough.  Back 11 years ago when I had her if you earned a B in her channel structure strategy class, you could use her as a reference after college.  I did this and I've worked for two different fortune 500 companies since.",1
I don't understand Math very easily and she did NOTHING to help me out. I went to the extra tutoring lessons and her office hours and she didn't seem to care enough. She likes to pick certain people from each class and embarrass them in front of everyone. Its kinda of a disruption...anyways DONT TAKE HER!,0
"Mr. Wisla is a great PR professional with a lot of real world experience, so if you're looking for advice he is a great source. He assigns a large group project that is a lot of work but as long as you do the readings to be prepared for attendance quizzes and complete homework assignments you will be fine.",1
"Professor Mizell is more into current events than the actual material you need for the class. You might as well take this online before you take her because nothing you do in here is relevant to the essays you turn in. She's constantly wanting to start a debate. Also, she has never once replied to any of my emails. If possible take someone else.",0
Great at explaining but the pop quizzes kill,0
"I actually liked her, but it was pretty clear which students she liked and which she didn't. The tests are usually very highlow scores with not much in the middle. I didn't really read the book. She doesn't have powerpoints but I was in her 3 hour class and am horrible at focusing but I was kept interested. Just write down everything in lecture. ",1
"Michael Plesha ruined my semester, not to mention my GPA.  It is unacceptable when the average grade on an exam is an F, especially if the class isn't curved. This is not a sign of  the stundents' failure, but the teacher's. I spent the entire semester frustrated and learned nothing, despite the hours I spent studying often with a tutor. 0/10",0
Pros (3),1
Profesora Luna is literally a sweetheart teacher! Makes you feel comfortable learning the language. Definitely the best Spanish teacher Ive had! You have to take her or else youre literally missing out!,1
"Im taking this class now and I hate that she takes so long to grade your essays , you cant apply the feedback to your next paper! She grades the papers pretty tough too. Hard to maintain an A due to that . And she she doesnt have extra credit for you to try to make up for a bad paper. Id never take her again !",0
Does not relate lecture to its application irl or the purpose of why he teaches us things. Assumes you have all prior knowledge of an advanced topic in what is meant to be the entry level course.,0
The worst professor I have ever had.,0
"this class was harrrrd! thought it was going to be easy because of the comments but jeesh, no way! prof is SO smart and knows so much, but just incredibly difficult to follow in lectures, especially because she rambles so much... quizes in discussion every week are pretty tough too... got a B in the class, but have no idea how... AVOID AVOID AVOID",0
"Yes, he is a bit odd, and yes, he is hard to follow. You are just kind of sitting there wondering where he got the equations he just showed you. But his quizzes and exams were reasonable, and could be done with gr12 physics knowledge, so I can't complain that much.",1
excellent proff,1
This was a great online computer science class on Cybersecurity. It was a lot more interesting than I expected and the voicethread discussions were a great way to hear from classmates in this online class.,1
Easy peasy! Lucky to have her. Barely studied the book,1
He's okay. Lectures will put you to sleep and the notes are a convoluted mess. Midterm isn't too hard as it resembles previous years and much of the material is from Digital Systems. The final exams of past years weren't too bad but ours was really really hard for some reason. Strongly advise reading the textbook to prep for the final exam.,1
"I liked the lay out of the class. You got an assignment every week which gradually got harder and harder, but nothing to bad. The teacher and the TA were great at help with any problem. The weekly assignment are the meat of the class, mid and final are the quizzes which I find easy so that was nice with the other classes mids and finals going on.",1
"He does NOT respond to emails. Does not provide any feedback with regards to grading, or for that matter does not provide a rubric. He will smile and says that he will take care of it, and do not worry,but he NEVER follows up! Not sure why he is still here.",0
She was really nice. She would go over problems a few times if that is what it took. ,1
Take this prof for any class. This prof makes the class easy to learn and understand.,1
"Okay I took his class Summer of 2019 and can I say he is probably one of the best professors Ive taken. He gives you a quiz every day based on his lectures and notes, and usually theyre take home quizzes. His final is an 8 page paper but he gives you plenty of time to finish. I truly enjoyed his class due to his intriguing lectures and lessons.",1
"In the beginning, it was easy. Then it got hard. There are random quizzes that are there to boost your grade. This is not a blow-off class.",1
"If you enjoy wasting your time, then she is the teacher for you. She loves to talk about her family instead of the subject she is being paid to teach. Just remember to bring something to do to her class, you'll need it.",0
worst teacher ever period !,0
"material she prepare is very good, but she is kind of cold nature, lots of assignments also tough marker",0
"I took her class online, and she didn't lecture. You were expected to learn by reading the textbook and the provided notes (which were just examples), and then do a ridiculous amount of exercises for comprehension. She gives ample time for exams that are open note, and she's an easy grader, but I struggled to learn through guided notes on canvas.",1
"Elliot does not care about you and gets offended my the slightest of things. Avoid him. He seems to make understanding the subject easy. While the exams seem straight forward, you wont answer correctly without thoroughly understanding the material. The exams questions are extremely tricky. AVOID AVOID AVOID HIM!",0
"Basically had to teach myself the whole course. She tries hard to answer questions and help you out, but most of the time it fails miserably because she can't understand your question and you can't understand her answer. If she lectured in Chinese, atleast 1/2 of the class would understand.",0
"Brown is fine. He keeps his voice low and is very reliant on slide presentations that have a LOT of material, and if you miss a day you miss a lot of information not included in the actual pres., but WILL be included on the test. I found him interesting enough, but the class was very boring with him. Tests have a lot of material on them.",0
"Dr. Kilmer is very helpful. He offers extra help sessions, bonus points, and trades your lowest test score for your homework grade. If you keep up on homework and get help when you need it, you should be fine. However, Calculus II can be a hard class for some. Don't expect it to be a piece of cake without trying.",1
"His ""participation quizzes"" are stupid! You need to get 100% on the participation quiz and  enter the word of the day to get 1% per week. He sounds rude when answering questions. He'll asks if you have any questions and then if you do he gets all annoyed. The course itself isn't hard but he tries to drop everyone's grade with the final. Good luck",0
He does not spend much time on teaching. Harrop is much much better and helpful. not easy A,0
This is the worst professor I ever had.  Does not answer questions.,0
"Seems a bit cynical in the beginning but as the semester went on he was an amazing teacher! Didn't quite understand something? Ask. Always there to help! Tests are a bit hard, requires studying.  Lots of notes, trust me, you will need them!",1
"She yelled at students when asked any questions, and always had mistakes in her quizzes and practice problems she went over in class. She was not clear in lecture, would rarely respond to email. She only let us see some quizzes and because she always made mistakes it left us wondering if our grades were correct. only take if ready to teach yourself",0
"Unless you have a good previous understanding of chemistry, avoid her like the plague. Yeah, you might pass but if you learn anything its most likely because you taught yourself. Getting extra help is like pulling teeth and her lectures are absolutely brutal. Such a waste of money for this class and will probably have to retake at some point.",0
"Jay is one of the best professors at Bentley. He knows so much about audit, and is truly dedicated to educating people on the subject. There would be no reason to take anyone else for audit. So passionate, very entertaining, and gives so many opportunities for extra credit. Great teacher, highly recommended, and you will learn a lot.",1
"I took an honors course with this professor and it was clear that the students were smarter than she was. Wessinger was only interested in getting students to memorize facts.  I expected much more out of the course, which turned out not to be very challenging. I wouldn't recommend her to the more capable students.",0
Miller is passionate about Chemistry which makes it a little more interesting to those who don't like Chem. I liked him as a professor but I also hear from lots of people who really hated him. He's willing to help you via email or office hours and provides some extra credit and other ways of earning points besides tests and quizzes.,1
"Lectures tend to be unclear. Very smart prof. but should be teaching a higher level chemistry course, not an intro course. Test averages were usually in the 40-50 range. Put in a lot of effort and you'll do good, but better professors exist. GO TO CLASS.",0
"I would have done better in her class if it wasnt because of corona, but nonetheless I would likely avoid her classes in future. Shes very lecture heavy, wants classroom discussion but doesnt often facilitate it well. She gives good feedback on papers and is a reasonable grader, but her participation expectations are hard to keep up with.",0
Excellent professor! She really takes time to make sure everyone in the class is on the same page. She explains very well and she is always there to help if you need any help understanding the material. Highly recommend her!,1
This is easily the most boring class I have ever had. She teaches you absolutely nothing. The book we have to purchase is hers so she makes money on it and we are required to do workbooks (1-7 pages of homework) every class. This class is extremely time consuming and a huge waste of time. UI100 should be an easy blow off. Her class is the opposite.,0
"After 18 years of school, I have to say Dr. Bezner is by far the best TEACHER Iâve encountered. An exceptional human being from every point of view!!!",1
"This teacher is really nice. She's a little hard to understand at first, but she works really hard to remember everyones name and get to know everyone.  I'm suprised to hear people say that she's snippy. I don't see that at all.  She does get annoyed if she sees u texting or doing other class work As long as you take notes/don't miss class its easy",1
"Although professor Villanueva is very experienced and knowledgeable in the subject, she does lack the understanding that students already have a demanding workload and has chosen to make it increasingly difficult. Especially in the midst of a pandemic she continues to grade harshly and make major assignments due two days apart.",0
Kathryn is very experienced and knowledgeable in Analysis. Her proofs are very rigorous and clear in logically clear.,1
"Logan was a unique prof.  I thought he a charming person that loved to enjoy himself.  Could have taught more clearly, but the course wasn;t very difficult.",1
"has a tendency to go off into space, but is a good person.",1
He's ok,0
"Ok hes a nice guy but sucks at teaching. fell asleep almost every class period. stats is boring in general but it doesnt help to have a boring teacher that doesnt speak english cleary. hw isnt like test, take someone else",0
"he is so rude... and not understanding at all... his matieral is dry and brings down the overall mood... his test, well lets say THEY HAVE ALMOST NOTHING TO DO WITH WHAT YOU LEARN. rediculous professor",0
This is my first semester with this Professor and thus far she hasn't given any effective feedback. I find that it's instead very critical with no ways of actually helping. Her homework assignments are high and the descriptions of what to do are incredibly low. I wouldn't recommend taking her class if you didn't have to.,0
awesome teacher !! Math is my weakest subject & he was very helpful & took the time to explain it until we got it,1
"What a terrible professor. He rushes through his lectures. We have class Mon and Thurs 8:30-9:45, and this fool always ends it right at 9:30 and relaxes the rest of the day. Tough grader and expects answers in a certain way. Definitely the worst professor I've ever had. Worst part is? You have very few grades. Only 6 hw assignments and 4 exams.",0
"You are graded by 3 things. Attendance, 1 paper, and 1 test. It sucks because you are not graded off many things so your grade can go easily down, but you have no homework. He uses words that don't even make sense and writes on the board and doesn't even organize it, its all over the place. Not a good prof, didn't learn anything.",0
"Tons of reading. Speaks either way too quiet or way too loud. His stories were pretty funny, but overall the class dragged on. The quizzes were constant and confusing. The material covered was much different than what was seen on the quizzes. The essays will save you in the end if you're a good writer and competent in the subject of Philosophy.",0
"Professor Heath is by far the best professor I have ever had at SCU. After taking one of his classes randomly since I couldn't get into any other classes because of my poor registration time, I decided to minor in Classical Studies. You certainly have to earn your grade, but he is one of the most intelligent and entertaining professors.",1
She doesn't respond to emails.  Has a paper that is worth most of your grade and the guidelines are hazy.,0
"PROFESSOR NINA IS THE BEST WRITING TEACHER !! I love her so much! She is such a nice lady, caring and very sweet. This class is not hard, quite easy! She is very interresting, the class is very dynamique and she is the BEST. Her class is closed next semester for writting 2, otherwise I would have taken her again without any hesitation. TAKE HER!!",1
"I dreaded going to her classes every week. She is very intimidating and demanding. The only good thing is attendance isn't being marked, but she will know if you skip class and calls you out on it. Readings were just long and boring academic articles. She seems to think she's better than she really is.",0
This guy is very rude,0
"I really enjoyed this class. Dr Pittman was an excellent professor. She gave frequent feedback on assignments and in a very timely fashion. You can tell she genuinely cares about her students! The course load was not heavy at all, very fair. She had clear guidelines on assignments but also answered emails of questions were asked. Fun class.",1
"Prof Allen is a great guy but this class was very difficult. In class he doesnt go over how to actually do anything and talks briefly about topics. There are take home tests where you can find all the answers online, but the in class tests were some of the hardest Ive ever taken. He lets you do an extra credit paper on anything you want",0
"As an elective for most people, this class is unreasonably difficult. The only grades you get are 4 tests that the class averages a 75 on. So if you're looking to get a C in an elective, sign up for this class.",0
"Hard tests, but he cares about your understanding at least and tries hard to attain it. Ask questions, his accent is a bit challenging to get used to.",1
She is a terrible teacher and spends most of the class talking about her problems. Her attendance is mandatory so you have no choice but to spend hours listing to her talk about her mother-in-law for hours. She gives no clear guidelines for projects and just expects you to figure it out on your own.,0
"Very poor teacher. Difficult to understand, likes trick questions, will not explain or provide additional examples.  If you have him drop the class now!!",0
Mrs. Perrel does not know how to  pass to her students her knowledge. Weird way to teach. Inpatient!,0
"Disorganized. Grading was easy if you put in the work and did the reading however her style sucks. Too many miscommunications and misunderstandings with regards to the syllabus, the group project, and everything else. Worst professor I have ever had. In a lower division course at that.",0
"I had a difficult time through her class. I study days for her tests and still only receives C. She requires hundreds of pages to be read for her tests. Thankfully, she gives you a good amount of writing assignments to help your grade.",1
"I took this class during the fall semester of 2020. His lectures were interesting. He has a lot of meme content which kept it interesting, but it was kind of excessive. We were only graded by 2 midterms and a final. He pre-recorded lectures and he hid the final lecture in a lecture without giving a clear date for it and many people missed the final",0
He's seriously one of the best professors I have ever had he genuinely cares ! He's the best and so nice ! He expects common courtesy like don't be on your phone don't talk when someone is doing their speech little things like that he really is the best I loved this class ! (:,1
She likes to talk about her family and baseball more than accounting. I only took her again because I know what to expect from her. I've been in 2401 for a week and we haven't had any actual teaching yet. Can't wait for December.,0
She is such a great professor. She literally explains every detail in her class. She is very energetic and confident and she gives people a feeling that she knows what she is saying to her students. She is also helpful and you can meet her during office hours and she is happy to answer your questions.,1
"I'm sure you have heard nightmares about this class. I know I did and it made me really nervous to take the class. I honestly didn't think I could pass, but I did. Honestly, if I could pass this class with a C anyone can. Yes this class is hard and unfair, but it is manageable. Trust me if you think you have no chance in passing your wrong.",0
"Amy has by far been my favorite teacher this quarter! The only thing I didn't like was having scheduled meetings online, but an easy 10 points, show up, participate, and you're good. Lots of great info! I love everything I learned amazing class! I highly recommend her! Lots of movies, but you have all quarter to prep for them.",1
"I don't understand why this teacher yells during his lecture as if the class cannot hear him. He is ineffective as a professor because during a group quiz, none of the students knew what was going on. I would advise to take another professor over this one.",0
if Francis Bacon were alive he'd tell it to her straight. People like her tarnish science,0
Best English Teacher!,1
"This class sucks-avoid unless needed.  very difficult grader.  recieved my 20 page paper back today with a F because he didnt read the last 6 pages and counted it as missing.  also, attend class if you hope to pass.",0
"Great teacher, very knowledgeable",1
Professor Davis is a good guy but a horrible teacher. His test questions are so vague that sometimes you have no clue what he is referring to. He also takes down the recorded lectures after we have an exam on them but then expects us to know all the materials for the final exam without the chance to review old lectures. I DO NOT recommend him.,0
"Great professor. Did 4 courses with him, absolutely the best",1
"Kind professor and clear class, but some important stuff that we should know was not covered.",1
Dale is fantastic.  He really gives you opportunity to realize your own strength as a person.  Students who don't like Dale are usually upset because he doesn't act like they're Super Special just for being alive.  He can really see through fake people and challenges the rest of us to be our best selves.,1
she is easy to understand and knows what she is talking about.,1
Prof is a really nice guy but i think he needs to go back to school to relearn new strategies on how to conduct a rehearsal. gives all the love to brass and drumline. doesnt write drill accordingly (putting clarinets BEHIND trumpets??). writes shows that arent interesting or something everyone knows. basically nice but out of date. ,0
Terrible. His tests are very inefficient from the student perspective and every time I send him an email for help he comes back with the super dry response telling me to figure it out. He makes it unreasonably hard to understand everything because of how fast he rips through the content. Avoid this guy at all costs.,0
"Easiest class I ever took. Exams are given on canvas (don't need to go to a testing center), every assignment is on chegg if you get stuck, final is a project. Most of the grades are on the assignments so just do those, and there is plenty of extra credit to make up for lost points. I got a 97 and have minimal coding experience",1
"Look, if you're going into chemistry, or want to learn, take Wendy Pell. For those 4 long months you will regret it, but coming out, trust me you'll appreciate the hell she put you through.  However, if you have a job don't take her. 60% of your time will be dedicated to this class.  Put the time in though, and you can get an A+ The Satisfaction...",1
steer clear if you want to pass this course. if you like learning everything via youtube and yahoo answers and gain zero understanding of concepts from his lectures then I guess go for it. he seems like a nice guy but he literally cannot teach calculus.,0
"His class was a joke, the books he gave in the class were barely used. It was not worth buying them at all.  I would not recommend anyone take his class.",0
"There is a tendency for the class to be really boring, but course research and assignments are really helpful and interesting.",0
"By far the MOST disorganized mess of a class I've ever taken. We had way too many projects to be completed in a semester and in the end, she marked none of them. She cared more about talking abut herself and her accomplishments than teaching an actual class. She gave us all an A, but I'm not sure the insanity I went through was worth it.",0
"Really hard prof. HAVE to do all readings. Designs class so that he doesnt thoroughly go over readings in lecture on purpose. writes exam questions only based on readings to test if you actually read or not. Each class has 100+ pages of reading, nearly impossible to read everything. Rly knowledgeable prof but dont take unless u have a lot of time.",0
"she sucks.  worst class i have had in college and this is my senior year.  if you want to feel like your back in middle or high school take her class.  the most stupid and pointless assignments, ridiculous amount of reading/busy work, and it was supposed to be american studies the 1930's not high school English class!!!",0
"I took this class over the summer. Dr.Z is very helpful. If you dont understand his lecture, just ask him. Always willing to help. He does give EC during quizzes and exams. If you attend lectures, do your homeworks and do all your labs, you will do good and get A. He is very funny. Class is not boring at all. Very nice teacher.",1
"Very fair in regards to grading and course load. Has average expectations of his students. Not overwhelmingly difficult, but there is work. You can't just show up and pass.",1
This is a hard class but Peffer does a good job at helping you get prepared for his exams. All of the quizzes throughout the semester are relevant and a direct example of what is on the exam (the only difference between the quiz questions and exam questions are the numbers used). Go to class and actively make an effort to learn the material!,1
"He went over only a handful of problems each class period, and he goes through them expecting us Calc 2 students to remember everything we've learned in math thus far. Be sure to remember every trig identity you ever learned and then some. He has given chances to make up points for our abysmal test scores though. Overall not my style of teacher.",0
"Professor Green's teaching style is not for everyone, but he understands that and makes it clear from the very first day. If you don't take it seriously to begin with it's your own fault. That being said, Professor Green is incredibly knowledgable and very passionate about the subject. Possible to get a lot out of class but it's up to you to try",1
"Its very tough to do well here unless youre a native speaker. Favoritism is rampant & melanin seems to interfere with his hearing aids. The more you have, the less you are heard. The grading criteria varies without warning & you will not know how your grade will turn out until its already over. Take his overall rating literally.",0
He is a really nice person since he is always there to help you. He gives bonus marks in the exam since he does consider for students.,1
"Decent professor. The one test we did was very easy, especially if you did the problem sets. The final, on the other hand, was quite difficult compared to the problems sets and the examples done in class. To do well in his course, do every question in the problem sets (several times, if necessary). You don't learn circuits by watching others do it!",0
"David is an excellent teacher, passionate about web programming, which makes his approach more efficient. It was fascinating how he developed a complete website from scratch, accurately detailing all the steps taken.",1
He's a very fair teacher who gives really good explanations for vague topics.,1
"Seems like she is scared to be up in front of the class teaching, sometimes stutters or doesnt know when you ask her a question.  Overall pretty boring and irrelevant class.",0
To go from an A in physics 1 To an F for physics 2 just tells you everything you need to know about the professor am not a lazy or bad student the I couldnt understand her. the exams were cryptic the people who write them dont know english. The worst part is her reviews just skip them waste of time. Honestly she ruined my life.,0
Mr. Cockerham is good at what he does. I did not do any of the practice problems as nothing was handed in I still passed the class with a B. Ultimately before every major test we went over a practice review thoroughly. I went home and reworked every problem what seemed like a zillion times and did well on the tests.,1
"One of the most boring while still difficult courses I've ever taken in my life. 3 hour lecture, and Dr. Harpp has a very monotonous voice. He often goes on tangents about things that sound like they don't matter, and then those things turn up on the exams (which are much harder than I thought they'd be). Wanted a bird course, got a hard course.",0
I wish I went with Falzone on this one. He's not approachable or helpful at all. He doesn't care about his students.,0
"I have had a very frustrating semester with Professor Gaffney. He seems to cater his class to gifted students, not the majority, leaving us average students left in the dust. It seems that his tests are focused on how quickly you can complete them. A slow test-taker, I never finished one of his exams no matter how hard I studied.",0
"Bad: labs are 4 hours, you need to be precise to the 0.002, need to remember Chem 101/102 (hell), lab is 40% so if you screw up you're not going to do well, if you are striving for a 4.0 and just need something for your chem minor, do not take this course. It takes time from other courses and causes pain.  Good: Dr. McDermott is amazing!!!",1
"I really enjoyed The Jacksonian Era!! I learned so much about history! There are three essays and a test, as well as weekly discussions on the reading. This class is easy and he posts every powerpoint online. Participation is a grade so talking in the discussions is important. He loves concise essays. He is a quirky dude. making his lectures fun!!",1
"If you're looking for a Human Values in Art Class, this class is not for you. The class felt way too focused on world history. The class had tons of reading and hours of assigned videos per week. On top of that, every week she assigned 5 writing assignments that were graded solely on number of words written. The class was boring overall.",0
"Shes a nice lady, but not the best teacher.  Most of the time our class had no direction.  A lot of people just never came.",0
"Won't make an effort to show up if he doesn't need to be there for testing. Even if it does happen to be test day, flip a coin if class is cancelled. Even when he is teaching the lecture it is extremely barebones. I think I learned nothing from his course except how to read lab instructions. Super easy course.",0
Knows many facts but has no real depth of musical understanding.  Tries to be one of the students instead of teacher and mentor. Unqualified to lead college level musicans.,0
Mrs. Pitelka is very compasionate and knowledgable in her subject matter.,1
On-line quizzes and on-line final exam.Easy to get an A.,1
Those who say he just wants to challenge you need to realize theyre paying thousands to willfully get their lives ruined by this sad excuse for a teacher while learning nothing in the process. You might as well print out his projects in your free time if you want to feel challenged because youll get the same amount of teaching and guidance,0
"This is my 2nd semester with this professor (the first being art appreciation, ART B1) and I have to say I enjoy what she teaches a lot! The class is not by any means easy, so you have to work for your grade...and I mean work! An A is possible as I have achieved an A both semesters. Wonderful professor, interesting class, be sure to pay attention!",1
"I am not even done with the course; however, ""hear me roar"". As a professor who teaches an online course, you would expect one to be more involved, detailed etc... She isn't. It's a good class, informational, & good discussions, but at the end you ask yourself: Where's the teacher? If you email her (a good long email) expect a 3 sentence response.",0
"Very hard class! He cancels class quite often. Does not help outside of class, and doesn't respond to e-mails. Overall, try not to get him as a teacher and you should be fine.",0
I am extremely skilled in web development and I couldn't pass his class because 1) he is using theory instead of actual demonstrations 2) he is using outdated HTML standards and course materials. 3) all his tests are theory based multiple choice and theres no tests on coding. 4)3/4 of the class is failing,0
"I never knew someone could repeat the same thing so many times but still say it like he's never said it to the class before. That about sums up Berg. Very, very dry class. Almost no opportunity for application to real life.",0
"If you want pass, keep away from him",0
So calc is hard anyways but if you do his practice exams they are really similar. I went to his office hours and he sat down with me until I got it. Pretty curved grading scale and drops two worst quizzes. If you go to class and pay attention you should be fine. He has an accident but it's not hard to understand.,1
Pretty good prof,1
"The prof gives you no idea about what the final or the midterm will be like . you practically learn nothing from the lectures. the whole course felt like a mess and you really don't learn all that much. in addition to that, most of the code given to us was buggy and had vague instructions.",0
"Lectures are entertaining, but you don't learn much. He's a nice, funny guy, and he's enthusiastic about the material he teaches, but you learn most of the material from reading the textbook and trying to do the homework. Exams are exactly like the practice exams.",1
GREAT history teacher. The problem for some students was that they got behind in the reading. I enjoyed the class a LOT.,1
"Gives helpful feedback on assignments. Very patient and positive attitude towards students. Main drawback to this class was the massive amount of reading, especially workshopping up to 19 other students in the class, 3 times over the semester, giving detailed feedback on each piece. Added to the time spent on your own work, it takes several hours.",1
"I'm not good in math or stats but was able to get an A, so everyone can just put some effort into it. Her teaching style is old and confusing at times but her course kit is all you need to know. Gives out practice exams & assignment make sure you do them ad you'll do fine (focus more on practice exams).  Found PASS sessions 210very helpful.",0
"Terrifying and bizarre experience. ""Accidentally"" marked my answers wrong throughout the semester and then continuously denied it, repeatedly pretending like they had no idea what I was talking about. One of my exam grades went from a B to an A because of these erroneous deductions. Very, very scary.",0
The only easy Chem professor at UD,1
"One of the best professors I've ever had. Really passionate about history, but won't hound you if you don't love it as much as she does. Willing to help you if you need it. VERY good with disability accomodations.",1
He is lazy and the material is difficult because he can't explain it clearly. You only get one week at the most to complete an assignment which is long and confusing. Lectures are boring and test can be difficult. Stay away from this professor,0
"Stopped showing up to lectures once I realized that since she wrote the textbook I could just read it before the (online) tests and get the same information. I also stopped showing up when I realized that you can earn 200% on moodle discussions and I had over a 100% average. Go to class on days when she's showing movies, other than that... sleep in",0
He's a really nice guy and makes a lot of jokes and he's easy to understand. He mostly reads powerpoints every class though. Attendance isn't manadatory but if you don't go you'll miss important stuff. As long as you're fine with taking a lot of notes you'll do well in his class.,1
"He was a great professor, and wants his students to succeed. The class is difficult, far from an easy A, but you will actually learn Calculus and not just memorize formulas and theorems.",1
"I took latin in high school and wasn't sure about this class, but McCreight made this class interesting. it rarely got boring, and trust me latin is a hard subject to make interesting. TAKE HIM if u can!!!",1
"If you get him for this series class, I feel the urge to warn you the WHOLE class is about HIM and what he has done!!!!",0
"He really loves what he does! When a teacher is so excited about what he is teaching, it will def rub off on you! He wants you to learn and if you just listen, you WILL learn! I studied (but not alot) and got an A!",1
"You must go to class. She does not put the information on PowerPoints, she only gives verbal lectures so you have to pay attention and take notes fast. No textbook, only some online readings that you have to write responses to but it's easy. She gives a study guide before each exam, overall definitely recommend.",1
"Took the 6 week class. Very hard, apply yourself, he will NOT baby you. Come to class & pay attention, no texting oror side conversations, he finds it very disrespectful, and it is distracting to other students.  Bottom line he helps, but will not give you the answers before you try. If you don't study you will not get a good grade. Read chapters!!",1
"AP is one of the best professors Ive ever had at Reynolds. She makes you work for your A bit if you show up to class, be involved, stay motivated and respect her the way shell respect you, youll get an easy A. Shes always willing to help and give feedback, she makes English class fun and hands on. Please take her while you can.",1
Show up and pass.,1
Kim is the perfect prof. for this class - her art background really helps you understand the abstract concepts taught in this course.  She lets you be as creative as you can and the exercises and projects are fun.  She is also very nice and grades fairly.  Definitely recommended!,1
Easy A good professor group project at the end no cumulated final only grades exams and group project and gives points for attendance,1
"I took her class online. Overall I didn't exactly need to communicate with her that often. Her online class consists of reading the book and doing the homework online, the questions come directly from the book. Overall its an easy A.",1
interesting prof tells amusing anecdotes keeps boring calc class tolerable,1
A poser.  Can't sing; Can't teach.  But if you need a shoulder to cry on.....,0
"Had Judith almost 10 years ago - she challenged me, forced me to ""really"" look at my work, and question - was fair to all in the class. You had to work - hard. I wasn't paying for hugs. She IS a practicing artist, and a very skilled reputable on",1
"To Marist students looking to take Discrete math, steer extremely clear of taking Professor Mcgrails class. Probably one of the toughest classes I have ever taken and would highly recommend taking discrete math with a different professor. Her homework were on webassign but her tests were extremely hard. STAY AWAY FROM HER CLASS",0
"While she uses the book a lot for homework, she hardly ever uses it to teach. Her entire method was hinged on whether or not you took French in high school. If you did, you're golden, if not, look for another professor because you will not get the necessary foundation for french from her.",0
"He was a good lecturer, but the course itself was terrible. He was the only reason to go to class.",0
"She is a good teacher but always super busy, she never replies to any e-mails and always leaves grading until the end of the quarter. I took this course online so it made it difficult to have any questions answered by her. The class is not difficult, just make sure you turn in assignments on time. Her face to face classes are much better.",0
"If u r taking 4555...just take her & u wnt regret it at all. Treats u like an adult, very clear and works on what the class decides. Very very interactive, fun & stress free class. Just remember to start your work on time, finish it & submit it...u'll be fine~!",1
"Dr. Fowler's lectures can be super interesting since he has lots of experiences and stories to tell when it comes to this course. However, I wasn't sure exactly what I was supposed to get out of this course because the class is super disorganized. Not many assignments, so the midterm, term paper, and final are the only grades.",1
WAS THIS A READING CLASS OR LEARN HOW TO FOLLOW DIRECTIONS CLASS? I FEEL LIKE SHE ONLY TEAHES US HOW TO FOLLOW DIRECTIONS NOT THE MATERIAL; BUT THATS JUST ME AND THATS GOOD I GUESS; OH HER GRADING WAS PRETTY RIDICULOUS TAKE HER YOU WILL SEE,1
Course is set up for students to do bad with very minimal time on tests/quizzes. Assignments aren't correlated to exam questions. Prepare yourself to become an Economist in a first year Micro course. Prof provides minimal help with feedback. Self-learning course. Prof is rude. DO NOT recommend. Take course with prof who wants best for students,0
He is the man and one and great at teaching.  Concept and detailed process at same time.  Very clear and makes the hardest classes easy to learn.  Definitely one of the smartest (if not the smartest) professors on campus.  Loves what he does.  He will get you fired up to be an engineer.,1
"I had Mme Solberg for every French class I took at K, and I loved her. She is an amazing prof, keeps things fun, always has a smile on her face, and really does care about her students and their lives. I wish I could've taken more classes with her! Don't even hesitate to take a class with her!",1
RUDE TO STUDENTS. the worst professor I have had at GVSU,0
"Very knowledgeable. He covers a lot of information in class. Sometimes his voice is monotonous - no inflection or ""pizzazz"", so if you're tired to begin with, you're doomed, but there's a lot of information in there - and he's good at answering q's. The textbook is awful and dry though.",1
"Very average math class. Not very exciting during class (you basically just go through long example problems), lots of textbook homework problems, quizzes on the homework and then a couple big tests. If you are good at math you'll be fine. If not expect a B. He takes a lot of points off for strange reasons.",1
"I took the online course over the summer. The class is manageable as long as you do the readings and watch the lectures. 8 modules, 2 essays, and two exercises. Aitken really enjoys what he teaches and that makes the class more interesting and fun. Plus he has a cute Scottish accent.",1
"He's a really sweet guy.  He really loves current events, so keep up on them and bring new develoments to old stories to class.  Don't bother buying any book except the one by Berridge. I only read that one and got As on both exams",1
"Just took him for public speaking online in the summer and all I have to say is WOW! not only were his 1 hour lectures on zoom extremely boring and repetitive, but then he expects us to understand fully how to give good public speaking speeches in front of a laptop to him. He also makes you choose topics to pick from and does not respond fast...",0
He is a good lecturer and is well-suited to teach the course material,1
"Cozzarin makes me so angry. MSCI 261 has the potential to be a good course. Too bad it was taught by such an incompetent professor. Really, Brian, we don't care about your life stories or if you hate real estate agents. Please start teaching so we don't have to cram weeks of untaught material into two lectures and have a mental breakdown. GG.",0
"Dr. Legge does the bare minimum as a prof. I have not received one evaluation yet and there are less than 3 weeks left of lectures. The course is online, she added 200 pages of notes during the first week, assigned 8 novels and we have not heard from her since, except to give evaluation dates. I would never take her class again.",0
"really sweet and nice man. people say how awful and tough of a teacher he is but they probably didn't go to class. his tests are hard and its hard to know what to study, but he gives a ton of extra credit if go to lecture and gives study review sheets.",1
First half of the class wasn't bad and the midterm was okay (although he set it out to be much easier than it was). The group project was extremely long and he added over half of the project expectations less than 1 week before it was due. He can be come off as rude when answering questions. Wouldn't recommend- lazy prof.,0
"Glenn is so passionate about physics and knows how to introduce students to concepts. It does get a bit math heavy in lecture, but the calculations aren't necessarily on exams. The lectures are interesting, and he allows for a lot of student input and questioning. If you plan on taking PHYS123, I'd recommend knowing basic Java for the projects.",1
"Top 5 worst teachers I've had at Towson (graduating senior). Worse during corona cause he can't use technology. Couldn't even turn camera on. Had to email hw, where he would MAIL back. Wouldn't receive the past hw by the time the next one was due, so didn't know how where to improve. No blackboard. No PowerPoints. No email response. Just talking.",0
"For the online class, his exams are poorly written and I'm almost positive I get a majority right according to the material provided, but I end up getting a bad grade. He isn't clear in any of his explanations or instructions and his work is shotty. Very unimpressed with his teaching style and disorganization.",0
He is a great professor but sometimes he gets off topic for the entire lecture time so you do not learning anything about that topic. Also he uses so many large words everyone in the class seems to be lost .,1
Here is what I can say about Prof  Lee  1) would take him again if he teaches other acc courses 2)His quizzes and tests are not hard at all. YOU JUST HAVE TO ATTEND CLASS AND STUDY. Midterm was a bit hard nonetheless it is very possible to get high marks on quizzes and assignments 3)He only teaches what you need to know 4)He can be mean sometimes,1
He is a funny funny man.  Class is difficult but if you stay on top of things it won't be that bad,1
"Extremely disorganized. Lectures are useless, all done through power-point. It seems like he gets irritated when you ask him to do an example on the board. If you want to learn corrosion go somewhere else.",0
"I enjoyed Mr. Parker he is a good instructor, very easy on his students that need it, and he is very funny, he moves fast, but as long as you do your homework you can stay on track.",1
"PART 1: For the 1st week, we had an intro assignment that wasn't due til the end of the week. I completed it the 1st day PLUS the one response required. We also had to attach two docs onto our post that needed an e-signature. I emailed her multiple times for help on how to attach the docs, but she coldly responded ""go back and read the directions""",0
"So I took sherry's 221 class fall 2019; I have to be honest she, her teaching methods are stuck in the past. the only reason i did well was because of group study sessions with R Gottfried, they will save your life. also the wiley HW is graded for accuracy. i would have gotten an A if it was for completion. they are very hard be prepared good luck!",0
"Make sure you come  to class with questions to ask. Definitely expects you to learn most of the material from text textbook. Very smart man, but can be a jerk.  Although the lectures were interesting, they were too often off topic and didn't fully prepare you for the exams. Expect to go to open lab and learn concepts on your own. ",0
AVOID AT ALL COSTS. I didn't receive a single essay back until the last day of the semester. The professor is not clear about what she wants at all and she never shows up to office hours to ask questions.,0
"Very intelligent, but not good at teaching. His notes are posted before class to fill in, but they are nearly useless for studying. There are 6 quizzes, 3 exams and a final, and online HW. He is not good at explaining the concepts and doesn't give much partial credit",0
She is amazing! This is the only class I look forward to going to.,1
He failed me even though I got  an 80% on the group project... Terrible prof. Not responsive to emails at all.,0
"This teacher does not allow you to get ahead, which is a big reason why students take online courses to be able to get ahead..",1
"She is very hard to understand. She uses powerpoint, but I think she just photocopies the pages out of the book because it is exactly the same. She doesn't explain anything and acts like she doesn't understand what you are trying to ask if you have a question. Most of the people in my class were completely lost the entire semester.",0
"Although the class is relatively easy, the professor seems quite disinterested in the class/teaching. I took only online classes because of covid-19, so I relied a lot on email as source of communication, Sandweiss will reply to emails, but if you have a specific question, his answers are pretty vague and not that helpful.",0
"I love Dane. He's a very great guy and is definitely passionate about what he teaches. He goes over the geology of National Parks like Yosemite, Grand Canyon, etc. Your grade for the class consists of 3 exams, a map project, and a final exam. Show up and pay attention for easy As on exams. Project is easy but start it early. Extra credit is given.",1
"I took her for ACC 210 online, and she seemed to be attentive to our learning, and the grading content is reasonable. Grading is based on discussion boards, chapter homework, a few quizzes, and the midterm and final. I'm not sure how she is for ACC 405, but for 210 online, she's a great choice.",1
"Brace seems nice at first look, but she's not as cute as she appears. Her lectures are VERY boring, and she never comes to class prepared. She wings half the things she says most of the time. Grading wise, it's confusing. One paper she could be an easy marker, the next it seems like she didn't even read it.",0
"Be prepared to teach yourself, no actual teaching takes place in class.",0
"If you want to learn, take his class. He is a really good teacher who is always willing be happy to help students. You will see he put his effort to his work. You will learn and improve a lot from his class. However, if you look for an easy class and easy grade, do not take this class.",1
"I like watching movies and I chose this course. I like her analysis about the movies, and she is really fair on marking papers and the deadlines. Though sometimes she repeated her words several times, it's not a big problem.",1
"And i quote, during a review session held, he sits in the back of the room and only says: ""You're college students, you figure it out,"" to any questions asked.  Need i say more?",0
"All of the tests are really easy if you go to class and pay attention. You don't need the sur le vif workbook, but everything else is important. Really sweet, and speaks English in the class as well, which is always helpful. The oral exam was ridiculously easy. She's really strict about phone use in class though.",1
He is very helpful and down to earth. A really nice man. Another great Professor in the Geology Dept.,1
I had professor McConnell for a face to face class we did not need the textbook because his notes/lectures were always on point! I had him during the COVID-19 and our class transitioned to an online course. He was also very helpful his lecture videos were amazing and he is just great! I would totally take him again he made statistics very easy!,1
"GREAT INSTRUCTOR!!! only draw back is he will make you feel guilty if you don't join LAPD. I have taken every class available with him Many people say he is an easy teacher. NO! He is a teacher that can teach, therefore you learn! That why you passed! Always willing to help, especially when you want to join law enforcement. Take him!!",1
"Good professor, explains things, good class",1
She is nearly impossible to understand. Her class is horribly organized and teaches absolutely nothing aside from a feeble attempt to expand your world view to fit her own opinions,0
"In this section, all the homework and quizzes were online.They are very difficult to pass by your self, although you are allowed to use your book.He is the worst accounting teacher in America!He doesn't care if you know the material by the end of his class, he diesn't even take the time to know his students because he knows they will drop his class",0
"Dr. Brecke takes a class that has serious potential to be a snooze fest and makes it fun and interesting. He's super helpful and makes himself available to you. When I was having group project issues, he listened to me and took my thoughts seriously. Probably the best class I've had at Tech.",1
"By far the easiest class I've ever taken in college, do the chapter writings and quizzes, you can do all of them in about 4 hours for the entire class. The exams take longer but just make sure you meet the word requirement! Also, he posts the textbook online! Highly recommend if you are taking this class to fill an elective spot.",1
"Cant stand this teacher or class... horrible lectures, nothing makes sense, and the tests are rediculous... none of the answers off review sheet are even on the tests! DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR! One of the least comprehensible teachers i have ever had.",0
I didn't go to most of his classes because all he would do is ramble off about irrelevant topics that have nothing to do with what we would be tested on. Basically it's a teach yourself everything from the online textbook sort of deal,1
I would not recommend taking his class. He can be rude. The test are exactly like the homework so you actually have to do it even though he doesn't grade it. I should have listened to the other reviews for his class.,0
"This class was so weird. James cancels class a lot and seems to be a pretty lazy guy. His classes have are not great, and he is repetitive. I will say, though, that when a good class day comes along, he can be passionate. My advice is just to do the work (not much) and get through the class.",0
He is really confusing,0
"I would never take a class with Dr. Miura again. He took a long time to respond to emails and when he did they were not clear. His office hours were not helpful. He grades extremely hard and expects you to rewrite his definitions word for word on tests. If you do take him, try to get high grades on the homework, it's worth 25% of your grade.",0
"Easily the worst professor I've had at tech. I understand online school this quarter was a drastic change, but oh my. 100 question tests, 60 minutes, and HARD. 10 question quizzes, 5 minutes. Tries far too hard to exert an extreme amount of control, and came off as very untrusting and condescending. Incredibly hard class online this quarter.",0
"She assigns a lot at once and is a pretty harsh grader, but you get to read some good books.",0
"Excellent prof! Class started out a bit slow coming from a science background, and a lot of the information seemed repetitive. I am glad I did not drop the course though because as the semester went on, the class became more interesting. Really helpful during office hours, and a GPA boosting class for sure! Light workload / fair exams.",1
"Bruce is a nice enough guy and he cares, however he was absolutely terrible at marking.  He had not marked ANYTHING by the last week of classes.  The class had a lot of potential, and I was very disappointed.  His TA marked our research papers and the comments were extremely unhelpful. I am sure if you write and think like Bruce, you will do okay.",0
probably the best professor at Case,1
"soo adorable and very intelligent. amazing teacher. but you really have to keep up with the readings. his lectures were a bit boring at times, but the fact he was extremly helpful VERY easy to talk to made up for it. take CLAS 1000, you wont regret it, believe me.",1
"By far one of the best professors I have ever had. If I could have him for every class I would. His tests are easy simply because of how well he presents the material. He is also available in his office for questions no matter how many times you show up. Great person, Great teacher.",1
Michael Darcher is single-handedly the best teacher I have had in all my life. He is a published writer and poet; he knows what he's doing and saying. He has great stories to tell. He involves the students in every lessonlecture. Assignments were fun. He is THERE FOR YOU. You can trust him. I would recommend Darcher to anybody. He is amazing.,1
"Dr. Rhoads is a nice guy, funny, and very approachable. But just something about the way he teaches makes me not absorb anything at all in lecture? I think its more me and the way I learn rather than anything wrong on his part. Very dry lectures, could never pay attention. Took a different prof second semester and grades went from a C- to an A-.",0
"Yeah, I suck at computers. Yeah, you have to actually ask for lots of help if you suck at this kind of stuff. But Deb is awesome. She is so enthusiastic about her subject it's contagious, and she will help you if you ask for help. She is very clear if you work one-on-one with her.",1
"By far the most challenging class I have ever taken. Dr. Dashner is pretty intense and expects a lot from his students. This being said, if you attend all the lectures, watch his youtube videos, and go over all examples he posts on his site, the material will start to make sense. Don't be discouraged! There's a light at the end of the tunnel! :)",0
"Dr. Israel gives a fair grade distribution and does not give free As. However, if you do the homework and understand the Quest assignments that he gives out, you'll probably be fine. The difficulty is on par with any other class and is not necessarily easier than other M408D professors, the midterms and final are fair and are reflective of Quest.",1
"She is a very nice lady. She is from Chile, and in this class never talks in english. she wants us to use as much spanish as possible. this class is hard because we read many stories, write papers, and do 3 huge presentations. it isn't really clear all the time what we are supposed to do for homework or due dates of things.",1
"Hes a nice guy, I am a science student and so i found this class super easy. He is a bit rank oriented for my liking (always talking about prestige of university, gpa averages, stuff like that). Most confusing syllabus I have ever seen too. Overall I recommend, don't really have to watch lectures if you're in a hard science. Very easy course.",1
Great classes with brent.. I was lucky to have him as a prof. Willing to sit back and chat when ever.  It's to bad he doesn't teach level 4 courses.,1
"He knows what he's talking about, but does not know how to make it clear to students. The articles he assigns make no sense and his discussions about them are not clear. He goes off on tangents, too. His tests are hard, especially since his lectures are hard to follow. I did not learn a lot in this class. He's nice, but can't teach.",0
"Assignments are very unclear, just like his textbook, littered with grammar and punctuation errors. If you like being graded on what youre asked to do, DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS",0
"His class is very hard for an introductory class. He's dry and talks in the same boring tone of voice in all of his lectures. Yes he knows much about what he is teaching about, but his class is hard. I would not recommend this professor at all. There is a lot of reading involved. I want to punch my past self for registering for his class.",0
"Harvey is a nice guy, but a francophile.  His classes are easy but boring, so just bring something else to do and pretend like you paying attention and let the class fly by",1
chill guy,1
"Terrific professor, easily the best I had at UCSD. Homeworks are usually quite difficult and don't always mesh perfectly with lecture. That said, Prof. Saintillan was always very accessible and I found going to office hours to be extremely helpful (if not required). His classes won't be a breeze, but they are well worth it in my opinion.",1
AVOID HIM AT ALL COST. Do not take his class you will regret it for sure.,0
"I've always really struggled with math, but this class was especially difficult. I was intimidated when going to his office hours, as he is slightly rude and pretty patronizing. He went through problems too fast, and it was difficult to comprehend what he was trying to explain. When students asked questions, he belittled them. Please don't take him",0
"I would not under any circumstances recommend anyone to take his classes. After taking his Introduction to Drama class I realized I will NEVER again take another class of his. He is a VERY hard grader, keep that in mind. There is a lot of reading for his classes too. Overall, he can be nice but he can also be very degrading towards people.",0
"Any attempt to be personable with her goes ignored. Assigns more than other lab professors without taking into account the added time they take. Exams are set up by assigning a random animal and applying concepts to that specific animal. Which in theory sounds great, but she gives you no direction or resources on what she expects, hard to succeed",0
Amazing person and amazing professor despite how challenging the class is. Do the study guides as you go or you WILL NOT get an A. Tough class but wonderful experience overall and will take her classes in the future,1
"Dr. Zhang is a great teacher. I'm not exactly a math prodigy and I did well in his class, so I'm sure most people who aren't absolutely amazing at the subject would like him. Attendance isn't mandatory, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't go. He lets you use index cards on the tests and is an unintentionally funny guy. Take him!",1
"At first when she explain the grading curve I thought she seemed like a fair professor. Then my semester of hell started. She was terrible at explaining physics and she was constantly unprepared. She would blame the students for ""not reading"" the textbook when her examples were wrong. She would lose everyone during her in-class examples. Terrible!",0
"He is a nice guy and the class is super easy, but I dreaded going every day. We don't do anything in class and he did not help me to understand anything better than i already understood it. There are a ton of writing assignments but he isn't really a hard grader.",0
"i'm taking this course now. yes, lots of reading--and writing, but the stuff is very interesting. i'm learning about things in our country/society no one has ever taught me before. the best class i have taken at wsu.",1
"I found her schtick to be more package and less product. Though she is a caring, fun, and kindhearted individual, I learned the least from her, compared to all of my other Psych profs. Further, beyond goofy (yet endearing) antics and (somewhat interesting) personal life tangents, I found very little substance in her approach, and she taught Cog!",1
Would not take again. Very unorganized !,0
"Great teacher, fun class and informative. Also helped me set up my schedule for next year",1
"There were three 5-7 page essays, but not only that, there were one page essays in between the essays we had to write, so it was hard to focus on the actual essays. We had to do a presentation for the three essays; there was reading, and a final, where we had to write two essays about a show we watched in class during the time of the final exam.",1
"DO NOT TAKE BIOLOGY FROM RISA COHEN! She is the absolute WORST teacher I have ever had in my life. I am an 'A' student and I got a 'C'. Her tests do not reflect anything she taught in class, she gives pointless homework/in class assignments, and she is boring. She is not the least bit helpful and she yells/embarrasses people when they are tardy.",0
"- Very arrogant - Large Ego - Doesn't answer questions to the point, just rambling - Tells you one thing during crit and then does a 360 for final reviews - Likes to showoff his knowledge -  Belittles students if they are not familiar of something he knows about",0
"Awesome teacher. Had him for Landforms, and then took Weather and Climate strictly because he was teaching it too. Always available for questions, and concerns. Great sense of humor... okay so some of his jokes are pretty horrible, but he tries, and that's what makes it funny.  The earring was pretty sweet too.",1
"Dr Crumpler isn't the best at explaining. He gives plenty of examples and practice but his exams are a whole other thing. He'll go over something for 5 minutes and then put it on a test. Have questions? well, better protect your pride because this man will make you feel stupid with his unnecessary commentary.",0
"Overall, he is great! He explains the reading well in his lectures, so it is simply recommended, not necessary, to read before class. Make sure to make an outline for the tests, and you'll be good. He is very willing to help outside of class, and is beneficial in preparing for tests and the paper. The grade is spread out among different aspects.",1
"Hands down the most caring prof I have ever met. Unlimited office hours, as long as he is at UBC, his door will be open, and whenever his door is open, you can feel free to go in and chat. ",1
Useless... inconsistent...unmotivated...ineffective.,0
"The beginning of the semester was fine. Once we went online due to COVID, things turned for the worst. He doesn't even have wifi at his house. Props to most profs for figuring things out quickly, not Prof Malaret. We got a total of about 3 emails during quarantine and were told not to email him at all because he ""gets annoyed by student emails"".",0
"Just terrible. Doesn't teach what he expects you to know on exams. Will take away all points on a question if you miss a single part. Wastes class time by talking about his cats and personal life. For such easy concepts, this class should not have been this much work. I learned nothing at all and ruined a perfect GPA. Do not recommend.",0
"I dont get why people say shes the best. Shes very narrow minded in the sense that she thinks everyone is a bio major with a passion for biology. Quizzes are VERY HARD and VERY SPECIFIC. Exams are easier and more general. Constantly studying for quizzes, everyday for HOURS and only got a B. She is also rude to shy people, she loves attention.",0
"Dr. Conner is funny, interesting, and most of all, very kind. He is clear about class expectations, and if you do the reading and study then you will do well in his class. Even if you don't do most of the reading (like me) and write your papers the night before (like me), you can land in the B-range.",1
If you're looking to make money shooting weddings...then he knows what he's talking about. Anything else...I'd go to someone else for advice.,1
She tends to stomp on many students if she does not hear the answer that she wants to hear. She doesn't take in other peoples' opinion and expect everyone to agree with her.,0
"Shes caring and all but if you're not good at math don't take her class. She teaches differently and is more advanced she told me to basically withdraw from the course since I wasn't understanding her way of teaching. She expects you to already know everything and move on to the next lesson after a week, also too much homework.",0
Tough class and not many assignments so don't screw anything up!,0
"Tough material, but find a study group and you'll get through.  Difficult to understand what he is saying at times, but you'll figure it out.  Take home tests and in class tests makes up final grade. He is a good guy and wants his students to pass.   *Side note: it is hilarious when his cell phone goes off with the T-Mobile ring tone",0
LOVE DR BROWN SO CHILL,1
"Dr. Pearson is a really helpful professor! If I had a problem or didn't understand the material he went over in class, he would arrange a time for me to meet with him, even at his own inconvenience! His class is really hard and I made the mistake of skipping a few times.  Overall, he is a really nice guy!",1
"Not an interesting course subject, but an easy enough class overall. Merrill is always helpful, and an easy grader. Do the work, you'll get the A. Coming to class isn't mandatory but it definitely helps. Prepare for lots of group work and verbal spanish.",1
Pretty entertaining when in a good mood. Tests were pretty easy.,1
Dr. Record was an amazing teacher considering that he was teaching a completely online format. He was extremely well-organized and made sure due dates were very obvious. As long as you keep up with the assignments the class is an easy A. Would highly recommend!,1
"As mentioned - he is a walking encyclopedia. Knows his topics inside and out, is incredibly helpful and enthusiastic.
 
 Very hard marker, you cannot BS him.",1
She doesn't teach any of the material required for tests.  So you basically have to teach yourself.  Good Luck with that!,0
Hes a VERY nice man. However hes unclear about his expectations and was very unorganized during class. Being a Spanish major who will be studying in Spain for a semester I am looking for a class that will challenge my Spanish skills and this class did not do so at all. I feel as if I learned very little from this class. I will NOT take him again.,0
"Does she think she is running her own class? Her labs take up more time than the chemistry class itself, 10+ hours a week. With 7 labs to do, each worth only 2%, its a waste of time and energy. She sends agressive and unprofessional emails about how no one included certains things in the lab which were never mentioned and takes no accountability.",0
"Dr. Pringle taught the second half of the course, focusing on fungi, diversity of life, and plant life cycles and biomes. It was her first semester teaching any class. She can be quite out of touch with the students sometimes. The things she presents as interesting and hyped up just are not. She asks belittling questions that nobody responds to.",1
"good teacher, but could improve by having clearer objectives, is set in her ways",0
"One of the best profs I had in my 4 years.Funny guy with British humor,but more importantly knows his stuff in and out.He writes his own book and it only costs like $7.Don't have to take notes,it's all in his book,just listen.Test are kinda tricky,just study his book he wrote and you'll be ok.Wish he taught the whole year.Was great in 709:481 too.",1
"My course was three hours along during this past summer. The classes are long, and he fully delivers his 3 hours. The homework is easy, and he posts his study guide online for his tests. You need to pay attention because even after studying the guide, tests were still difficult. Attendance is lenient, however he does take row twice. ",1
He thinks B is a good grade! So you will work hard for B.,0
"please do not take her course. even if you just want to finish up the English series and she's the only prof with an open seat.... do not do it. there's a reason her classes never fill up. and if they do, trust in 2 weeks half the class will drop. just finish up your other breadth classes or wait until a better TA opens up a seat in their class.",0
Very goofy guy. During discussions he would stop for 2 SECONDS to see if we had any comments and launch into his own exposition. In retrospect the class was pretty easy and I got exactly what I thought I would get from Civ 10. Just enough.,1
Excellent Professor!!! Received an A in his class.,1
"It's hard to understand his lectures. He values his lectures. He might as well try to rewrite the history books. He has lectures different from the text. Than both are than on the test. He has so many tests, both take home and in-class. At times, he'll overlook the text in favor of lecturing his point of view. Which is harder to study than the facts, because he's passionate about it.",0
"An enthusiastic professor.  When he is lecturing on topic, it is so insightful that it makes up for when he is on a rabbit trail or story (which is good, because that happens a lot).  Beware his explosive laugh and flying lollypops and tootsie rolls. Loves student participation. You hear Van Til every day, and yet never figure out who he is : )",1
"He is not that great and passionate instructor. His class is boring actually. However, the worst instructor is JC Clapp. I took JC and Brian's coordinated class. Comparing with JC, Brian is an angel because JC is so mean. JC ruined students' GPA. Brian is very kind person but lazy..",0
"Jill is nice. If you get on her good side, and go to her office hours, you will get a better grade. If she doesn't like you, she will give you a worse grade. She often assigns assignments that she never goes over, so most of the time its a waste of your time to do.",0
"Real police officer so he shares a lot of real life stories. Attendance is not mandatory but, if you don't do the readings you should not miss any classes!",1
All he does is lecture the entire class. There is little to no student interaction or engagement. His feedback on assignments is unclear and his explanations don't make any sense. So confusing. I was frustrated and confused about what he wanted me to do. Grading and rubrics were unclear (if provided at all).,0
"Extremely captivating lectures. You won't want to miss a single one. Dr. Taylor is a tough marker, and in this class my only complaint is that she tested us on information that we had not covered, not in class or in the textbook, also demanding 3 papers in a term is pushing it, especially considering the multiple-essay format of her exams.",1
"This was very lecture-heavy and he read off from his own script which is almost the same as the powerpoints that he puts up in class. 5 easy ""quizzes"" and 1 paper. Textbook is not needed (except when you need to do the essay but should be able to find it online). Easy A if you read the powerpoints and do the study guide.",1
"Best teacher I've had at the JC. Super funny, and very helpful. I genuinely enjoyed taking his class.  ",1
Very helpful and nice lady. She really enjoys what she teaches. Her tests weren't too difficult. If you study and pay attention in class her class will be fairly easy.,1
"i would say avoid at all costs, but considering she is the lab coordinator, there is not really much avoiding to do. her labs are ridiculously long and hard for no reason and is super passive-aggressive when it comes to replying to emails (that is IF she replies)",0
Very messy lecture structure. Really all over the place. Material consists of a collection of random and seemingly unconnected facts. Hard to study for. Can't really say it lays a foundation for understanding rather than just makes you (try to) memorize a ton of information. Would try to avoid her as a teacher but it will definitely be difficult,0
I REALLY RECOMEND HER SHE A REALLY GOOD TEACHER VERY FUN TOO. THE CLASS FOR ME WAS EASY I GOT A B. VERY CLEAR ON EVERYTHING TAKE HER YOU WONT REGRET IT.,1
"In the first couple of weeks of classes, Stan was spending a lot of time talking about his own personal life and his son. He mentioned how he cares more about his son than teaching here... um ok Stan, you don't need to tell us that just put some effort and be more alive when you teach and stop being so stressed and maybe let a new instructor teach",0
"I love Butterworth!  He is an absolute gem as a teacher.  He is incredibly open-minded, helpful, and intuitive.  He also picks really unique and interesting material for the class to read.  I would recommend taking his class regardless of what you're majoring in.  He is by far my favorite English teacher.",1
Terrible!! He doesn't give you near enough time on his quizzes or exams. If you don't know the information as he does you will run out of time. His study guides are ridiculously long and you have to write essays along with your 80 questions on exams. He does give extra credit was the only bonus but you have tons of other work too.,0
"Dr. Rinewalt knows his stuff. He can be hard to listen to in class sometimes, but he is generally quite helpful and receptive to questions. You won't get an easy 'A' out of his class, however.",1
"The materials that she chose for the class were interesting, but she rarely  gave me any meaningful feedback.  Her grading criteria on major assignments was confusing. Plus, she was not super nice when responding to my questions.  I would recommend buying the textbooks via kindle.  Also, ask a classmate first if you have a question.",0
Not a tough grader at all but the time limits for quizzes and exams are rough. This professor is knowledgeable and knows his topic but if you arent crazy about art history you will hate this class. Online classes are difficult as it is but this one was a downright struggle for me.,0
Super passionate teacher and really experienced and qualified. Show up to class and it's a breeze!,1
"I don't know if she just changed the course but there is too much work for a LIB 100 class. She managed to put 9 papers, a test, 6 POP quizzes, and a presentation project at the end. And if you miss 6 or more classes you fail the class. I don't understand why she decided to make this semester so difficult. This is your warning!",0
"I found the concepts within the course to be quite interesting and I will probably end up becoming an ECON major. However, Professor Elzinga is simply a bad professor. I did not learn a single thing from any of his lectures and the course was basically learn it yourself. Luckily, I had a very good TA who helped me. Elzinga is famous, but he sucks.",0
"If you don't mind being forced into lectures because the notes are useless and she does things her own way, here's your teacher. I will never attempt another of her classes.",0
"If you don't plan on coming to class, then don't waste your money by taking this class. He's a boring guy and it was painful to attend but somehow I got the highest grade in his whole lecture class and wrote me a stunning recommendation letter for a scholarship.",0
"Excellent professor. His lectures are engaging, he loves class participation and as an earlier reviewer pointed out, he swings on the coat racks when he's listening to students speak. Priceless. Nice guy, good professor, average marker. Highly recommended.",1
"She's not very clear, sometimes she runs off tangent many times and forgets what she's talking about.",0
MY FAVORITE PROFESSOR. He's so passionate about what he does and makes the class so fun. The lectures are long but so entertaining. There's never a dull moment.,1
"Dr. Rodgers is a very nice guy, but a HORRIBLE teacher. He doesn't explain anything clearly, even after you ask five times. I have taken other Chemistry classes, and what he teachers isn't consistent with any of them. I had to work extremely hard for a B and I am typically an A student. Avoid him at all costs. He is never on topic and tests suck.",0
"His English is not that good and he can't really explain well, he mostly reads from the slides and the lectures are sooooo boring!!",0
Loved his lectures. Seems incredibly knowledgeable about Shakespeare. ,1
"i do not suggest her at all she expects everyone to be as interested in plant biotechnology as she is i went into finals with a b+ and 75% of you grade is decided at finals came out on my report care with a c-, was not happy and i refuse to retake this class or any other class with this women...beware",0
I took a film class with Dr. Franks. The classes met twice a week with one meeting being about three hours long and other being 1.5hrs. Dr. Franks repeatedly got an attitude and was rude to the student that had to slip out for a restroom break during the 3 hour class. I heard the student multiple times explaining her bladder disorder to Dr. Franks.,0
"Dr. Bayers is an extremely enthusiastic professor. He is not only engaging in class, but encourages you to visit him during office hours to get extra feedback.  Although there is a lot of writing, about a paper every 2 weeks, you will feel more confident and experienced in your writing at the end of the course. He's really chill and easy to talk to",1
"I hated the man. Made horrible jokes. Wasted half the class talking about stuff that was non-relevant. Way too many personal stories. If you can plough through the jargon though and follow in class, it's honestly an easy A. I never even opened the textbook once, but I attended every class",0
"I'd have a beer with him outside of the classroom but I won't be taking his comp 2 class... Attendance may not be ""mandatory"" but your notebook will be graded down if you miss a class period. ( even if you copy in the notes from the day you missed before he grades the notebooks) .",0
"Treats you like a child. She isn't willing to help you with the simplest things. I absolutely hated this class. If you study you'll do fine, it's just a pain to sit through the lectures and quizzes every week.  Take anyone else if possible.",0
I love Professor Doane. She is amazing!!,1
I do not appreciate the cursing and belittling that I experienced in this class.  Scanlon was completely improfessional with questionable ethics.  Even going to the dean did little to change his behavior.,1
this prof's #1 goal is to make his students life a living nightmare. avoid at all cost,0
"""Alright boys Midterm exam, lets go""  Give us more of a notice next time because a few scounds is not long enought to study.",0
"Just take class with someone else. If you have children, a job, any other responsibilities, if you have any form of ADD/ADHD. You will fail. The amount of information your expected to absorb and retain is unreasonable for the time frame. The amount of writing is ridiculous. Lets face it, your not at Harvard its GCTCS. She doesnt act accordingly.",0
"I did not enjoy this professor at all. He was funny at points but he consistently wasted at least 15 minutes talking at the beginning of class when he could be a better teacher. He was constantly distracted during class, telling stories and I think the class couldve gone a lot better if he focused more on the material then being the funny guy.",0
"He was a great professor, all his lectures were entertaining and made you reflect a lot on personal issues or something that may be going on with your life. Do all the homework and you'll pass with flying color, easy grader as long as your answer seems like there was effort put into it",1
Farley is extremely passionate about the material he is teaching.  He presents clearly and makes it as interesting as he can.  If you want an A or a B you have to attend class and pay attention.,1
"paul is incredibly helpful, he goes out of his way to help students, even if you are no longer his student! he really is a fantastic prof and very passionate about his work.",1
The class is composed entirely of lectures. The lectures tend to be boring and attendance is mandatory. You will lose points from your final grade every time you miss a class. He also does not allow laptops for notetaking. There was no graded homework. The midterm and final are daunting but he grades them easier than you would think.,0
"while his grading was not hard, he liked to talk. Felt like anyone with an opinion or experience different than his was blown off.",0
"Don't take his class unless you have a lot of background in econ, because he doesn't go over basics and just jumps right into material, and doesn't consider if the class is learning or not. Overall, a really ineffective teacher that does an incredibly poor job at actually teaching. Wastes so much class time. I didn't learn a single thing from him.",0
The worst professor I have ever had! Treats his 200 level class like we are all English majors taking honor/400+. I have never failed anything till this class. When I tried to approach him about it he brushed me off. He does not use Blackboard and does not make clear (in writing) what he wants on any assignments. Do not take as an elective.,0
I didn't learn much from this course,0
Dr. Legates is an amazing professor. He never lets his personal beliefs on climate change affect his teaching and is very unbaised and respectful. He is very responsive and is always eager to take time to explain things that we don't understand. He is funny and often cracks some dated jokes mid class. Very knowledgeable about statistics.,1
"Wilson is a very sweet professor. She's very confusing explaining projects and assignments, but the cool thing is that she lets you do resubmissions after she grades everything. I didn't learn a lot (which is unfortunate) but at the same time I don't feel like it was a wasted class and I got an A. Just be wary of who you pick for your group!!!",1
"She's a nice lady and all. But if you don't do the reading, she will call you out on it and the class grade is primarily based on the midterm and final. She's not very clear with what she expects and doesn't tell the criteria until AFTER the fact.",0
"One of the most useful classes that I have taken for my major. Gives a great overview of everything you need to know about HR, very interactive lectures. Quizzes/tests aren't bad, straight out of the book. Other assignments include mock interviews (very helpful IMO) and a career assessment. Loved her, she was an awesome professor, would take again!",1
"Goes very fast. Obviously knows what he is talking about and does a good job teaching the basic concepts but sometimes gets confusing. Only grades are three tests. Can't study with friends with other professors because Yuhas teaches the class so differently than any other professor.  Don't suggest sitting in front row. Overall a good, fair teacher.",1
"Storrs is a sweet, adorable, old man, but this class is VERY basic. It is actually quite boring. The readings are easy and he goes over them in detail. He isn't responsive to objections though...Michel-Antoine Xhignesse better be your TA! He's hilarious and EXTREMELY helpful- a stickler for structure, but actually goes over the material in depth.",1
"Mr. Hensen is a great instructor  . if you were having a problem with anything you could ask him for help during and after class. he has great ways to make class entertaining and interesting. i always looked forward to his class, not only because i like biology. doesnt give much homework..if any at all!! lab practicals are a breeze and tests. easy!",1
interesting teacher...not full of himself,1
Waste of time. He's nice and helpful to those he likes if you're not on that list you're out of luck. The good part is you'll be able to figure out where you stand rather quickly.,0
"Professor Vasquez was by far one of the best professors I've had. She gives amazing lectures, and explains in detail the topic on which is being discussed. I would definitely take her again. I recommend her if you're wanting to learn history in depth.",1
"Denise Preston is a really nice and caring person. She kinda goes over the basics in class that I knew in high school and builds upon them. If you thought you were a good writer, think again. Denise Preston will take the time to look at your paper and give good feedback on how to revive it.",1
Took Issues in Contemporary Art w/ her. Syllabus and blackboard assignments do not match up. She will not correct these even when told. Lecture based class. Make sure not to miss any or you may fall behind because she tends to add on to the already Very difficult grader and will call you out in front of everyone. Would not recommend her classes,0
"International Finance Class, and he was useless and a horrible teacher.  I've never met a teacher with such arrogance and referred to the students in the class room as ""the average people.""  He should be out of teaching and it's an embarrassment that he is still at the business school.",0
Wow the TAs are terrible. Did well on both tests(90s) and yet the TA gives a 65 on the essay that we worked really hard on. No feedback was also given. Ended up with a 75. Ridiculous. Not to mention what a horrible disorganized course it was.,0
He was one of my favorite professors at SFA. He made class that enjoyable and really wanted to teach all his students. I was devastated to hear of his passing a few months ago. It's hard for me to think of a teacher I would have recommend more to anybody going to SFA. Having him this spring during covid helped keep me sane. Thank you Dr. Collier.,1
Be prepared to work hard for your grade. You have to show up to class and only 25%  of the class showed up everyday. If you show up and do your homework then you will be fine. He gives a 20 point curve on tests and homework . He also allows a cheat sheet. If you enjoy a challenge then he is your guy.,1
"I (along with the rest of the class) LOVED Figen! Can't wait to take oceans with her in the fall! Boring material, AWESOME prof and i ended up really enjoying the class",1
This professor is the most insensitive and unfair professor ive ever had. She never chooses on students with their hands up. She like to ignore students in time of need. she is horrible.,0
"Professor Gray is great. The class' content can be challenging but she is a very reasonable grader. She is also just a lot of fun--We act out plays in class, she gives us candy, etc. If you put the work into this class, you will generally get good results back. I would definitely take another class with Prof. Gray.",1
Jess is one of my all-time favorite profs!,1
"As other reviews state, he's a good dude. He knows lectures suck so he gets the class involved (especially at 7am). Tests are super easy because he lets you use notes, he doesn't believe classes should just be ""learn the material and spit it back"". Highly recommended, will be taking him again next semester. Easy A as long as you do the work.",1
One of my favorite college teachers; still remember her 6 years later,1
"Very nice guy, very enthusiastic about the subject, but not so clear and difficult to understand.  Assigments were fairly simple but exams were hard to study for even with supplements.  Not my strong side, so I knew this class would be difficult for me, and as much as I enjoyed Dr. Passwaters, I did not enjoy the class.",1
"Easy A. Lectures are useless and do not help for tests or essays. Professor Stott is difficult to understand as he rambles and his lectures are very disorganized. The class consists of two essays (the textbook and discussion help a lot for information) and two tests (know the IDs and essay prompts, be specific)",0
"Test are much harder then the basic examples in class, does not give solutions to problem sets, does not post marks online and attendance is mandatory to pass due to in class questions. Overall you have to do a lot of work to pass this course.",0
Mean and detached from reality,0
"This woman is remarkably unfair. Everyone(-few) fails participation, she doesn't know the answers to her own multiple choice, if you ask her a question like ""Why did I get this mark on this question when I have this answer"" and she's all like, ""oh, I see what you are saying, leave your paper with me and I'll fix it."" yeah...she never does. Useless.",0
"I loved Professor Bigler! She does not hand out grades and WILL make you work.  She is very intimidating, but do the assignments, volunteer in class every now and then, and ask questions when needed and you will do fine. Not a hard class by any means.",1
"Honestly the worst prof at SFU, don not take this course, I needed one history credit to graduate as a 4.0 student and he ruined it all. I do not understand how he is employed. All he wants is students to fail. I can get over the reading and homework, but honestly just help people succeed not fail! On a power trip and just plain rude and unhelpful",0
"""C+ Sue""? Nah. Show up, join in class discussions, and write like a college student, and you will do well.Women's film was one of my fav classes!",1
Lego lab RULES!,1
"Very easy to take --- tests are not difficult, and the research papers are a piece of cake.",1
"Latin can be a bit tricky at first. If you put some work in, though, there's no reason that you can't get a fantastic mark. Prof. Carty wants his students to succeed, but he can't do the work for them. Marking (in this course, at least) is incredibly fair and weighted to your advantage. One of my favourite courses, but clearly 100 level.",1
"Don't even think about taking him for Differential Equations. The first day when he said this is the first time teaching this class in 20 years I should have dropped it. Not prepaired, completely oblivious his surroundings, doesn't know what he is doing half the time, and just a bad teacher in general. Don't make the same mistake I did...",0
"In class lectures were not helpful. Most of the class was spent rambling about nonsense that could be explained much easier or that would not be on the test. Homework was regularly assigned and took about 4 hours per week. On the bright side, if you are curious about being a biology major, this class will quickly inform you if you should be one.",0
"The class I took was seminar-based, not lecture-heavy. I feel the lecturing Dr. Eller did was lacking in depth and quality of commentary. She gave out multiple long articles a week for us to read. Many of the articles had a social justice, leftist tint to them, and weren't concrete academic social science.",0
Extremely passionate about the subject matter. Turned what could be a very boring class into an interesting narrative each class. Thoughtfully executed discussions led to a comprehensible understanding of the subject matter. The discussion response are easy. The main paper is not hard if you do not procrastinate. The midterm and final are easy too.,1
"Super easy class. I am really bad at math but this prof really helps you out. She curves everything. There are a lot of homeworks and a few quizzes and tests, but she goes over almost exactly the qs that are gonna be on them during review. Do have to buy a code for Pearson which is $$$",1
Worst teacher I have had yet. Assignments are unclear and hard to understand. Treats this 200 level class like a masters course in communication. I highly recommend not taking her class unless you like low grades.,0
"Bill Dean is the goat for real. If you want a good class and a good time, he's the man. I had him in the mornings, and it was worth getting up for.",1
"Dr. Avila really cared about the students. She made sure everyone knew the content. AMAZING professor, I understood everything she was teaching clearly. As long as you turn everything in, youll for sure get a B and getting an A Is also easy. Shes also very funny and sarcastic, you can tell she loves what she does! Great prof!",1
"She is terrible. She has exceptionally high standards for her assignments but does not tell you what they are. When she teaches, she will often contradict herself in what she says, so be ready for being confused. If you try to ask a question, she will downright say that you're mistaken, and in the end, you get no help. Good luck for whoever has her",0
"He is a pretty decent teacher. He sometimes comes off as being a little boring, but always draws your attention again by a corny/but funny joke. He uses clips and illusions that are pretty interesting as well - i would take him again.",1
She is an amazing professor. She is very helpful and her class was based on 4 quizzes and a written paper. She is also very sweet and in our final exam she bought us fiber bar :),1
"He may not always be clear in what he wasnts from you, but is always looking for you to find your own way through a problem!  He's a great teacher and is always willing to help you!",1
Save yourself she will mess up your average.,0
"He is very rude and has no consideration for student success. If a student does not do something the exact way he vaguely tells them to do it, he will become very upset and refuse to help them. He does NOT teach anything. All he does is talk down to students thinks heÃ¢??s all mighty and great. Awful Ã¢??teacherÃ¢??Ã¢?Â¦if you would even call him that.",0
This class is boring. She tends to ramble on a lot. The work is hard to understand.,0
"This is by far the worst mathematics teacher I ever had. Although this teacher is super sweet and really cares for her students, her teaching style will leave you completely confused. I spent more time on her class trying to re-teach myself material she already discussed in class than focusing on my other classes. One tip: Beware.",0
"Professor Parker is a very hard professor to get along with according to myself and many of the  other students I talked to.  He grades papers very hard. Very hard to stay engaged in his class because he is very boring. The lectures didn't teach anything, if it wasn't for his attendance policy there would be no point in showing up. Don't take him.",0
I really like him!! He seems to know a lot of information and explains it well and stays on topic and lets us know what is important. I dont even fall asleep in his early morning classes .. I recommend him too..,1
"Never set up a blackboard, never got a syllabus, never had a Zoom meeting, claimed everything he created was somehow deleted by BB?? Would only teach by email. Then we get an email after 2 months from the English department that he is being replaced for the course, and he sends an email about his retirement, don't know if that's true. ??? sus",1
"This professor actually expects his students to have a good understanding of research methods. If you dont, itll be difficult to get a good grade in the course. He curved are class by 9% and I was able to get an A. Hes really helpful and nice. I would take him again.",1
he sucks. i have never been in more boring class. all you do is listen to him lecture then do a bunch of hawkes. easy math only if you pay attn in class but its so boring no one goes. hawkes is hard..not the same as what he teaches in class.,0
"Very good teacher. Incredibly helpful, and makes herself clear about what she wants out of the class. Her lectures are actually interesting rather than boring.",1
Excellent professor. I didn't think I could love marching band and symphonic band so much!,1
"Dr. Miller is a very nice and caring man however, he is not a good professor in my opinion. The majority of the class fail his tests. The only thing going for you are labs and PAs. Its not easy to fail his class because he drops the lowest grades and the Practice assignments are worth more then tests. However I did not find it easy to do well.",0
"Honestly, I don't understand the bad reviews. In my opinion, he is one of the nicest, well-respected Professors in the Finance Department. Yeah, the material may be dry in the way its presented but as long as you look over Power-points and do the few assignments he assigns, overall, its an easy A type of class!",1
"Unfortunately, I agree with a lot of the other comments -- if I was going to skip a day of econ, it was always Marty's lecture. Attendance isn't really necessary; you can easily fly by using the powerpoints online -- even the reviews were kind of pointless. She is very nice and does offer a ton of extra credit, so at least her course is bearable.",1
"too many group projects for online, worth 40% of grade tough grading on group assignments Makes it seem like an easy A class but quite difficult slides don't prepare you for the tests read the textbook",0
"Dr. Pell is an amazing woman but she talks quickly and chooses difficult questions to do in class, and then flies through them leaving you feeling confused and a bit discouraged. On the plus side, she is always very willing to help you when you go ask her a question. 5% ATTENDANCE MARKS, go to class! I was an A+ chem student in hs and I struggled",1
"Dr. Hibbs is a great prof and Adviser. I highly recommend him for FYS100 Career Habits of Highly Effective Managers. Lots of real world experience with great real world scenarios. Be sure to read the book and the worksheets and ALWAYS attend class, It is worth your time! A couple papers, a presentation, and a couple tests.",1
"Class was very easy. Do the discussions, film analyses, and quizzes, and it takes less than 2 hours a week for class. You have to do four papers in the course that are a little time consuming, but it is an easy A to help your GPA.",1
"Melanie was an amazing prof for English 100. There were lots of readings and forum posts in the course and four essays. It was not lecture heavy. She gave very clear and positive feedback and was always willing to give extra help or clarify things. Overall, the course was not too difficult. I highly recommend taking a class with her if you can!",1
"preachy and biased; class is super easy tho and can be interesting all depend on your TA, section on racism was okay but this is more sociology class-BORING; the class is like going to church, she treats us like 3 year olds, only take it if you must",0
"Geelen is one of the most ill-mannered and offensive people I've ever met.  Like the fellow below aid, he knows how to interact with equations, but doesn't know how to interact with people.  Everyone hates Geelen.",0
"He is a nice professor and can be funny but as a teacher, he is extremely confusing with dates not adding up to due dates for papers and the syllabus being unorganized. Having to write many papers throughout the semester that seems just like busy work.",0
"Had last rating deleted? HE IS A WONDERFUL PERSONyeah, no. He needs replaced by a TEACHER. I took him TWICE (C- 1st try) and know he has little teaching skills. THIS IS AN INTRO for non-STEM-oriented majors like CM. He teaches like everyone's a mathematician skips ALL in-class algebra, only uses fervor-paced Powerpoint, and LTA's are jokes. CHEGG",0
take vulakh if you can.,1
"Not the worst class in the world, but tests are very difficult. No study guides for test so be aware. Would not recommend taking this class unless you're prepared to read and study.",0
"Dr. Smith is a tremendously educated on the information given in class. Not sure if I would take her again tho. A LOT of reading, including 3 novels and long online readings she assigns every class almost. Almost the whole grade is based off of 2 tests and a paper. Also, I disliked how much she subtly pushed her political view on class topics.",1
"Prof. Sgro is a great professor.  She is nice and very helpful.  LOTS OF GROUP WORK...Was not very responsive to emails at times, but if you show up and do the work, you'll pass.",1
Saw this low rating and thought that it was unfair - this is a fair professor who dealt more than fairly with lazy gen ed students.,1
"Omg this woman was soooo extremely rude and stuck up it was shocking. I was interested in taking this course but after meeting her I no longer wanted to be in the collective behaviour course. Also, she comes 15 minutes late and makes the class wait for her.",0
"Mrs. Mudrick-Smiley was a great prof I had at DCCC.  As much as I hate English and all its ""to-the-point"" grammar, she made it fun and interesting, esp with the movie we watched with ""Boy in Striped Pajamas"". I'll be forever thankful for the great recommendation she gave me that helped me get into Temple. Take her if you want a good English class.",1
"Not a good lecturer at all, harsh grader, and made the class extremely theory based to the point you would just have to memorize everything and hope for the best. Tests were very difficult and he refused to curve or even let kids use formula sheets during the exam. If you're not a math major or naturally good at understanding theory avoid him!",0
This was the last class I had to take at SVSU and thank god it was. He ruined my experience at SVSU. He does nothing but talk down to students and makes you feel scared top ask a question. He is the biggest hypocrite. He complains and projects his feelings to his class. He also makes very inappropriate comments about students. DO NOT TAKE!,0
Jackie is the best teacher ever ! She is the best teacher ever ! Shes SUPER FAMOUS cause of her kindness and always respect her students. She always makes me feel so thrilled every time I attended in the class. She makes me feel like I WANT TO ATTEND TO THE CLASS. Thats the truth. She gave us so many games n if u pass it u will get HW PASS ï¿½ï¿½,1
"Rob was one of the nicest professors I have had at GV. He really enjoys teaching the subject. Grade is made up of quizzes, two papers and 3 play performance reviews. The reviews and quizzes are easy, but he grades the two papers tough. I also didn't most of the plays we went to in class, may had graphic language and sexual content-not my cup of tea",1
"He gave me a chance to make up my grade, responded to e-mails quickly, and assigned fun discussions. He offered plenty of time to complete homework assignments and gave quizzes that nearly reflected what's on the exams. He is a real gem! I would definitely recommend taking him for Trigonometry. Would love to take his class again.",1
Absolutely terrible.,0
Very hard to understand him at all whether through emails or in class lectures. He got very upset when students asked questions during his lectures and when student were unclear about something he made hard to understand in the first place. Avoid him if you can,0
"I took Ahmad for my JINS class and really enjoyed her as a professor! She is the only professor at Truman who genuinely cares about the wellbeing of each of her students. She kept the course content interesting, but I will admit she was a bit forgetful at times. Overall, she just wants to see improvement in writing which makes it an easy A.",1
"This class should be easy but she makes it difficult with her rigid criteria for short answer responses. Test questions are ambiguous. It's her way or the highway, do not try to explain your reasoning/point of view. I consider myself an excellent student but felt personally targeted in this class because I didn't take notes using her outline.",0
"One of the worst professors I ever had. She is unorganized, messes up on quizzes a lot. + She is really rude and doesn't not listen to what you have to say esp during these times. She claims its bc she been a professor for 30 years and your just slacking off. she never answered my emails either and when she did she yelled at me. do NOT take her.",0
this had to be one of my worst teachers. she doesnt help and expects you to know everything. she makes a simple subject very difficult. i would never recommend her,0
"Excellent professor, excellent class, very happy with her. It did require timely submissions of weekly papers with lots of reading and research to be done, which was challenging, but nothing impossible. She is very strict with deadlines, though.",1
"le pire prof que j'ai jamais connu, a eviter a tout prix",0
"Tests are very difficult and annoying, everyone likes him cuz he's a first year bio teacher with lots of enthusiasm but he would fly through lectures and there was no textbook.",0
"Great chemistry background, applies to chemical engineers.",1
"Awesome guy. Very friendly. Like any other band director, will get mad during practice occasionally. More than willing to work out solutions with you if you can't make practice.  Bear in mind that marching band takes up a ton of time. Semiweekly football, plus basketball and volleyball. You're at Tech, so only do it if you really love it.",1
No teach basics.  Hard homework.  Hard tests.  Hard labs.  Book is horrible.,0
"i realized I did not even need this. but the fact that he is actually pretty cute made it, not a total loss! LOL",1
"all of the questions on the exams are trick questions and are extremely hard even if you study and think you know the material, you'll get to the exam and be confused probably.  don't ask questions unless you're prepared to get roasted by him.",0
While Mrs Yang is a very kind professor her ideas over group work are less than ideal. She will assign people to random groups at the beginning and at the middle point of the semester. Group work sometimes isnt bad but when you get stuck with a bad group it hurts your grade bad. The professor also did nothing as one or two groups had conflicts.,0
aWSOME PROF...EXTREMELY SOFT SPOKEN BUT REALLY ON THE BALL,1
"I went into this class very excited but I found this professor to be a taskmaster rather than an educator.  I found her to be rather curt in her replies to students, bordering on impatient.  She seems to genuinely love math, but she needs to realize that she's working with undergrads.  Her attitude is just not one I liked, even though I got an A.",0
Dra. Graves was super nice. You can tell that she really enjoys teaching and she's travelled to tons of Spanish-speaking countries so she knows a lot. She's tries to make the class fun and always plays good music at the beginning,1
"Funny guy, lean but repetition",1
"Prof. Gordon was very helpful.  Her lectures were interesting and very helpful for the field.  Work load was not to bad.  Her final was an interview which was interesting and wrapped up the class in a great way.  She has lots of experience and she will help you if you ask for it.  Very down to earth, and cut out for the job!Take this class with her",1
"Definitely a fun prof, who also teaches really well. Not afraid to tell anecdotes while waiting for students to finish writing; quizzes, so far, have been fair;
 course seemed too easy given the level of the material... but maybe that's because I had Prof. New for my last calculus.",1
His lecture videos were extremely vague and did little help for the exams. The assignments given were always time consuming and graded hard depending on your gsi. He is unaware that students have other classes other than his.,0
"After 4 Calc courses with him i can honestly say he is my top Prof. Calc is hard, but he makes it totally doable and even fun at times. Get to know him and you'll love his sense of humor. gets the class laughing every class. He always has time to help in his office and know exactly how to explain every math problem even if it isn't his course.",1
GOSH!!! WHAT THE HECK IS HE TALKING ABOUT???  Completely unhelpful!  Worst grader EVER!!!,0
Wonderful teacher. Very easy online course. Turn everything in on time. Follow his formulas and tips on becoming a better writer. He will respond to your emails and answer your questions thoroughly. You will get an easy A. I am delighted to have been taught by such a quality professor.,1
"This guy is the worst prof i ever had, boring, rude, outdated, and a tough marker. please get rid of this prof",0
"Professor Wu is a very nice guy, he allows cheat sheets on tests and doesn't have too many exams. Be sure to put everything on your cheat sheet! His lectures are hard to understand what's relevant, and for his lab projects make sure you attend those classes because his instructions are vague at best.",1
"Dr. Larson is a great! You need the book for the exam review, she tells you what topics you need to focus on and you need to look up the rest. Highly recommend that you take her classes!",1
Barely did any examples in class. All quizzes were exactly from the assigned book problems. Pretty much left you to learn diffeq yourself without much help. Did not write much on the board and ended class way too early to learn anything most days. I learned almost everything in that class solely from going to SI.,0
"She is a prof that really cares that everyone understands the material. Don't hesitate to ask questions, as she gives clear answers, and is happy to answer any question. Some days, however, she goes through the material very fast, and I needed to review at home to understand what happened, but overall, she's a great prof for this course.",1
"This professor offers his own book for MTH 227 for free which is nice and convenient; however, don't expect to understand much from the book. This class has a lot to do with definitions and understanding those definitions while applying those definitions to the math. This professor doesn't teach much but expects his book to instead.",0
"Only take this class if you need it. He's incredibly smart but if you don't understand the material, chances are he won't like you. I had to teach myself all of the material through the textbook and youtube videos before I took the final. Worst class I've ever taken. ",0
"This class was way more difficult than it needed to be. The quizzes were 10% each and had over 50 vocab words and 10 listening examples to memorize for 20 Q's. Reading ""requirments"" came from an $85 online textbook that students hardly used. Lectures were material heavy and dry and slides were not posted after or before lecture if you missed class",0
Just awful.,0
"He introduces interesting theories but never explains the stuff thoroughly in a reasonable matter. For example, he almost never explains why you apply this theory to that certain proof.",0
Gosh this is a boring class and she does her best to make it interesting. There is a lot of material which she flies through. Also her test are mostly multiple choice but they are hard. Do not take lightly. and her reviews don't really help that much.,1
"if you get stuck in this class bang your head against the wall--thats how youll feel most of the semester. so much pointless work, the huge research paper is assigned 2 weeks before it's due, 40-50 journals...and the topics discussed are silly and from a liberal viewpoint...drop out if you have a choice between that and taking it",0
"This guy's class ia a joke!  I would not call him a teacher, but rather a mere facilitator.  There is no input from him or any of the other professors that ""teach"" this class.  The class is pretty much run on auto-pilot with virtually no involvement from the ""professors"".  Useless busy work - This is from someone that got an A!",0
"Awful professor, does not respect students' views especially if they oppose his own. Exams do not reflect personal knowledge but regurgitation of his opinions. Had the potential to be a good class but was ruined by his constant ramblings about seatbelts.",0
I took Dr. Ralston for the entire calc sequence and have immense respect for her and Dr. Tyler. She is an excellent educator and truly cares about all her students. The classes were challenging but always very doable with proper studying. Her interactions with Tyler are very funny and made the 8AM classes worth it. Take her if you can!,1
Prof Mantell is super sweet. Lecture is VERY boring. She does read from the PowerPoints posted in canvas so if you miss class a lot & review them and take notes you should have a good understanding. 4 exams & online quizzes she drops the lowest test grade.,1
Had all A's at Carolina until I took this class. Finished with a C (not sure how) and I emailed the TA and professor to ask for my final exam grade...no response. The grading scale is wack. Don't take. Seriously.,0
"Boyer is the most interesting professor I have ever had. I took the live lecture section of World Regions and it was my favorite class all year. Relatively easy class, as long as you can keep up with the work. He bought the whole class pizza on Halloween and made us think that someone prank ordered $600 worth of pizza in his name. So yeah great guy",1
"He was okay at times, but expect for him to mess up examples and confuse you. Not my favorite class, he didn't help much. ",0
"SHE IS SO AWESOME. She is caring and so funny. She even plays Spanish songs at the end of each class . We dance sometimes, too! I would retake her classes 100 times if i could.",1
"He's one of the best professors I've had at UNCA. He's really nice, explains the material well, and very helpful. If you keep up with the class (read, study, do homework), it's easy. If you slack a bit, it's more difficult.",1
Dr. Moe is perhaps one of the hardest professors on campus. He doesn't even stick with the subject and goes off on tangents. He doesn't follow school policy and does things his way. He doesn't even follow the class textbook. He is also very rude to the students and constantly degrades them. I wouldn't recommend Moe. Other professors are better.,0
Avoid him at all costs,0
"I felt as though she did a great job covering the course material. I had heard terrible things coming into the class, but she turned out to be approachable and helpful.",1
"Although Prof. Chinitz is a nice man, he takes this class too seriously in my opinion. There are two writing assignments, both of which he grades really harshly. theres a reasonable about of reading throughout the semester, but I am so bummed out that I took him as my prof. because I always try to get A's and this class didn't allow me to.",1
"Worst ComputerScience teacher ever. YouTube is moreHelpful than his lectures. Doesn't care about whatDifficulties his students are facing. Wants everything to go old school, like no use of the internet forPracticing, writing code on paper, etc. And a slight match of theCode with code availableOnline leads to AcademicMisconduct (gives negative 100%)",0
"Extremely helpful gentleman, I would always recommend his courses. If you cannot learn from him, then you are in the wrong program. I find him as a father figure to me, who is always there to help his students.",1
"Whispers during lecture, have to read the entire book to study for a test because you can't understand a thing he says.",0
"I thought this class was going to be like a Calculus class I took in high school, but no. Professor Gupta truly is the worst teacher I have ever had as he never provided any reasoning for grades and even though I went to all the classes and his office hours, still did not do great on midterm or final. RIP to whoever has to take him next year.",0
Prof Paige is hands down a great professor. She is easy to understand and she makes the classes interesting. For the first hour of the class she teaches the material and then the class is divided into groups. 30 minutes before the class ends we all come back together and each group has a turn to discuss. She is flexible so just speak to her.,1
"Dr. Stark is a really dedicated teacher and super helpful if you have any questions. Our class was the first 290 class taught so it was frustrating having to be the test class and have to get through all the kinks. Overall, Dr. Stark tried to make things fair and clear so we could suceed in the class.",1
one of the best prof at u of t,1
"Don't ever take Dr. Lewin's class. She can barely organize her class, assigns over 200 pages of reading a week (that honestly make no sense or anything to do with the course), essays every week, harsh grader and will constantly tell you that Indians could write better than you. If you want to pass a class, make sure you don't take her's.",0
"I LOVE Professor Crane! What an AMAZING Professor! I am so glad I had the chance to take his class. I signed up for the 8 wk course, which was grueling as is, but he made it EASY. His lectures are FUNNY, INFORMATIVE, and I carried what I learned from him to my university sociology classes!  He is so encouraging. I now love sociology because of him!",1
"Professor Brownlee is a nice guy, but I regretted taking his government class in a way. The topic was very interesting and I enjoyed the lectures. However, it's hard to get an A in the class due to there being only 3 exams (30 pts) and 10 points for showing up on exam days. A difference of 3 points or a bad exam can ruin your grade. Lots to read!!!",1
"Really great guy. Highly recommend taking if in honors as it is an easy honors section. Tests come right out of the powerpoints and assignments, and are very easy to do well on if you study a little. The class is slow at times, but overall it wasn't too bad, definitely worth it",1
"LMG is the best. She sends a kind reminder after each class to let you know what went on during class if you missed. Homeworks are easy points. Hardest thing in the class is the test, but study some and you should be alright. I would definitely recommend taking her class.",1
The best proffesor at UW I would say I was scared of coding but he made me like coding very apporachabke resubmission saved me the quizzes you could retake them as many times as you want before the deadline cant give me enough rating since 5 is too small. So sad for him to leave UW and take his career else where rare proffesor you would ever come,1
"I had already taken Chem before and I skipped Chem151 to take this class. His lectures are EXTREMELY dull, and I spent most of the time taking my own notes on the exact lecture he was lecturing on for 3.5 hours. Exams were easy for me, but any questions I had were not answered well, and it seemed like he never understood how to answer a simple one.",1
"This Professor is OK, but finding out when assignments are due, what needs to be done for them, and those details, are not able to be found online, or in his syllabus. I wouldn't recommend this class. It's really hard as a three hour, and most people spend the time on Facebook the class is so boring.",0
"Dr. Johnson is well-versed in his field of study. However, his lectures do not pertain to a lot exam content. Most of the actual course content has to be learned through reading the text books. The class is also extremely paper heavy. He gives an adequate amount of time to write the papers, but they are very lengthy and require a lot of research.",0
Took this class over the winter. Everything was very organized and he even gave us assignments early so we could start early. I would take it again,1
"if you have the option to pick between him and prof gross, pick him. Hes little nicer to talk with. if you do take notes every class and study question on textbook you should be fine. quizzes arent that hard but tests are harder. Just make sure you have good notes and dont be afraid to ask questions.",0
He tries to make his class as interesting as possible. Just show up and study his notes,1
I am currently taking a class with this professor and I am finding him hard to understand. Beware he does everything on powerpoint and rarely uses the board. I have found it hard to learn math being done on a powerpoint. He is also extremely fast paced. We had a test last Monday and We have one again this Thursday.,0
"Ryan is a very nice guy and is receptive to feedback. However, he is not a very good professor and is extremely unorganized in his lectures. Doesn't really seem prepared a lot of times and students are forced to wait for him in class. He is very unclear on his grading and changes his expectations all the time. 10/10 would not recommend",0
"Christy is a great professor! The class is not difficult, but reading the materials and participating in all discussion posts is beneficial! She is very kind and encouraging and gives great feedback on assignments (which are easy and fun!)",1
"By far the dumbest class ever. Can't believe I actually payed for it. He loves to hear himself talk. Class was made up of 3 papers in which he is never clear on what he wants. There are also discussions about topics ""related to citizenship"". But don't worry, you don't have to do any research at all and can say anything without any providing facts!",0
"Poorly organized and never helpful. Assignments were almost continuously in flux, took ages to be returned, and were often marked incorrectly when returned. Exams had numerous problems that gave an explicit guideline and then took marks off for complying. Do not take a course with this professor unless you are forced to. It's not worth it.",0
Tests were way too long and he talked way too much.,1
"John Watson is the cornerstone of the AU journalism program. He's also an attorney so Legal Aspects of Communication, the course he teaches, is a STRONG AU offering. John Watson is one of the finest people I have ever met. He is a great educator.",1
"She forgets a lot. I also have assignments from October that have not been graded. That was two months ago.  She will give you advice on how to do a project but nitpick about something else. She is not super helpful. I ran into a problem while designing and instead of helping she said ""oh well"". She knows what she is doing, just not a good teacher.",0
"Very rude, very mean. It is very most important that you do not take class with her. She will not teach good and she will get out of from here. It is very most important you avoid her. WORST PROF EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!",0
Questions student's integrity on a regular basis. Dodges questions during class.  Wastes time during class rambling about stuff that is not related to course material. If you use a laptop for note taking he will dock your participation grade. I got A's and B's on every assignment and somehow got a C+ for the course. Ridiculous amounts of homework.,0
"Very Intelligent prof. Lectures are hard to follow at best, but that is mainly due to the course content. Examples given in class help a lot. Approachable after lecture, during tutorials, and during office hours.",1
"My favorite professor during my time at MSU. He won't give you anything unless you work for it, but he will bend over backward (I'm mean, really, he's a spry ol' guy!) to be there for his students. Show you care, and he'll make sure you understand the concepts. And be sure to ask him about climbing stories. :) Thanks for everything Dr. Callis!",1
"Good, fun teacher. Lots of homework and online confusion. Probably one of the better choices for this class. I would give her a B+; well worth the hassle.",1
"Prof. Coulet Du Gard is a super nice lady who will do everything to help you whether you were good in french in high school or not. Gives a lot of online hw though that is not very helpful, but otherwise the class is easy and fun.",1
"The University enjoys capitalizing on his connections for international business trips to save a buck. However, his temper tantrums and frustration with small issues during the trip that were either beyond anyone's control or his fault mean he is not well suited to plan trips. I learned very little. Until he's out, delay taking this course.",0
"great teacher. interesting, and challenging material.",1
"Unapproachable, belittles students, too much homework.",0
"Her lessons are often incoherent at best and often seem rushed but at the same time she will drag the class out past the end. She is not supportive of students, often blatantly saying that they are wrong and never being constructive. She also claims that spelling and grammar are essential in her class, but apparently, that does not apply to her.",0
"The key is to put personal things in the writing. It took me two papers for him to say that, and it brought up my grade incredibly. Don't think too hard.",1
"One of the best SOC teachers ever.  Him teaching it is a reason to take it.  Very funny, caring and interesting.",1
One of the best instructors I have encountered at both Delgado and my previous college.,1
"She is abysmal. Completely and utterly vague and when she ""clarifies,"" she only causes more confusion. Probably one of the least effective teachers I've had in an institution of higher learning.",0
"Worst professor ever. Very boring and unorganized lectures. Adam has zero passion and doesn't seem like he wants to be there. Equation sheets aren't allowed on tests, no partial credit and review days are a joke. Material isn't that difficult but tests are you're whole grade and he makes them as hard as he possibly can. Avoid this professor",0
Professor Donia is a gem. Definitely take notes during his lectures and do not be afraid to challenge him. He gives his opinions and tells you its his opinion and why he believes it. If you disagree write it in the essay and use facts for your counter arguments. Received great feedback in disagreeing with him. Which is very rare in professors.,1
"Online class instructions were a bit confusing, essays graded very differently and harshly, definetely turn in every assignment and on time, but not sure your best effort always gets the best grade in this class.",0
"Professor Crowell is fantastic!! I have never taken a music class before so naturally this class was very difficult for me. If you put in the effort and show him that you really want to succeed, he will make sure you do. The book is a must have as you do homework out of it almost every class. He's overall a great person!",1
He's an okay professor as long as you read the textbook before going to lecture and after lol. A good recitation TA really helps. They can make going to lecture pretty much obsolete.,0
"Dr. Wilhite is an extremely difficult professor. She's hard to learn from, but if you're interested, you're guaranteed to receive good grades.",0
"Does not give very clear directions, but he does give you a chance to turn in a rough draft without receiving a grade which I found helpful.",0
"Dane is extremely passionate about teaching, and makes learning about geology as well as our national parks and monuments inspiring and interesting. Wish I had him in class rather than online.",1
Five tests are basically your only grades. Says you need to attend class but only to turn in homework. He doesn't make sense a lot of the time. Tests are graded hard (one t/f question wrong was 7 points off in one case). Do not take him if you have to take 1301. He is not helpful and confusing in his lectures.,0
"the labs for this course are the most useless labs you will ever do in your life. he also does not care about feedback given since the labs have been the same for years. finally, what the hell was the point of that salivary gland lab? almost nobody manages to isolate the glands, yet the lab never gets modified. the lab explanations are useless.",0
"Professor Wheeler makes lecture enjoyable and interesting. I believe the class is way too hard for a 100 level so if you are looking for an easy GenEd, this isn't the one for you. A ton of reading outside of class. Befriend your TA for sure.",0
Do not take his class. He is one of the most unprofessioal professors I have ever met. Terrible at teaching and explaining. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS.,0
Shes amazing,1
"Her class is a pretty easy A. The textbook that is used is written by her and has study guides in the back that will definitely get you an A on all of the exams. Lectures are interesting, and she is very passionate about the arts. Extra credit opportunities are more than enough and the quizzes are very easy.",1
Not the best. So- so,0
"So, most people probably won't take the class I took with TeBeest, but I'm glad he was the one to teach it.  Sure, he might be a bit preachy at times, and repeat information a lot, but that sort of stuff works in your favor, rather than against it.  It's a good time.",1
"He rambles SO much, and barely talks about sociology and what we have to know for the test.  Nice guy, bad professor",0
I found Dr Rashmi to be a very nice prof for my past two chemistry lab components. She has been really helpful via email and has offered to have zoom meetings to answer my questions when I was having difficulties with my reports. However I find that the lab reports are overly tedious and long and take longer then what is estimated.,1
Dr. Gordon flipped this class into half online and half on campus and its great! My biggest complaint was there never enough in class time to get everything done she wanted to. Her online lectures are great - they are long but in the end very beneficial. I would take her again for another course if it becomes an option.,1
"If you wan't to pass this class do not miss a single lecture and be sure to pay attention. Also, don't take his 8am class, because his lectures are boring and they'll make you want to fall asleep",0
I thought I should do a service to SDSU students and warn you about this teacher. She is the worst prof I have ever taken! She is unorganized & overall this was a ridiculous class. Tests are long do not include multiple choice.I will get an acceptable grade but she made it really hard for me because she is so nonsensical. TAKE HER AT YOUR OWN RISK!,0
"I took this class online and it was difficult, but manageable. Definitely a lot of assignments due each week plus there are two group projects for the semester, which was interesting since it was online. Having said that, it still is better than taking a language class in person especially if youre like me and struggle with Spanish.",1
"Would go on rants about how the students are taking up parking spots, blame us if the class doesn't do well, asked for help and extra credit and he would not help at all, was late on givng grades out on time. Don't take the class with him at all.",0
"He has an accent, so he can be hard to understand sometimes. The lecture slides (from the course website) are unorganized and havent been updated since 2002. He does NOT use Blackboard and doesnt hand back marked labs (so you wont know if you did them correctly or not). He also doesnt post ANY grades until just before the last drop date.",0
"While Keval is indeed a little outside the box, she has a good heart and she cares a lot about what she teaches. Show her you're interested in the topic and you'll do well. Don't laugh off reading and writing assignments, she grades them tough. Go to class and don't get behind.",1
"SO glad this class is over. Had her for museum studies, not an easy class at all. Attendance is important as she does not follow her syllabus at all and often gives random assignments with random due dates. She is very forgetful which can sometimes work in your favor w/ due dates. Very writing intensive be prepared for weekly writing assignments.",1
Great professor!  Very helpful and very smart.,1
Do not him to post material in a timely fashion. He'll get around to it eventually. DO the extra credit projects!,1
You don't need the textbook and you probably won't pay attention.  I can say I have learned absolutely nothing in her class.  She is boring to listen to and she reads off the slides.  The worksheets are easy but you need to study for the tests.  She started using a grading site for essay s that doesn't even apply to how she grades.  Awful class.,0
"Dr. Vinebrooke was without a doubt my favorite prof this year. He cares about his students and really tries to get them into the material hes teaching. Hes a fair grader and allows extensions. For one of the labs, they brought us a bunch of algae drinks and snacks! I recommend this class to anyone, algae people are great.",1
"There are countless negative reviews on here reporting the exact same thing for a reason, DO LISTEN to them. Linda acts extremely annoyed when asked to do any work and will attack students who do so. She rushes through her PowerPoints in about 5 minutes and that is all she is willing to do. Rude & insecure person, please avoid if possible.",0
"Upbeat, nice guy.  Always willing to help.  His grading system allows for mistakes throughout the semester.  Be a serious student and you will do fine in his classes.  I was actually very disappointed that he went on sabbatical this year and that I might not be able to have another class with him.",1
"I dreaded going to this class. For the tests, you had to turn in pages and pages of essay questions in order to take the test, only to have to basically regurgitate these in the exam. If you have a lot of time to write page long essays and are able to memorize them word for word, take him, if not, steer clear! ",0
Accused people of cheating when they weren't there were simply following his instrutions word for word.  Made it harder than it had to be and would not tell you in any way what he expected of you as a student.  Bad class.,0
"Absolutely LOVE Dr. Reddy! Took sensory phys with her and enjoyed her lectures. Her test questions come straight from the lectures & audio recordings, so come to class and be prepared to learn! Also, go to office hours and get to know her because she's hilarious. Went so many times that she offered to write me a letter of rec for dental school :)",1
"Extremely hard grader, shes a nice lady but if you want a good grade do not take her class.",0
She's really nice and helpful if you try to approach her. Her exams are easy if you go to class and take notes. Great personality - she tells jokes where nobody get her punchline and she just LOL:D  Cons: lectures are quite confusing. She assumes that you still remember the basics in F.T. and probability theory before coming to class.,0
"She is okay, but she is not as free and nice as she comes across. I privately explained to her why I didn't have an assignment done, and she called me out in front of the entire class. Very rude! As a teacher, she is easy to understand, but difficult to please. If you are not a Shakespeare lover, I would steer clear from her!",1
"he was a good professor if you really want to learn about writing...I stayed up all night to do his research paper...and he still gave me a B. He takes english too seriously, and will ramble on until the exact time class is suppose to end...he is funny...he has a preferred style of writing, which i havent figured out yet.",1
"Totally unengaging, lectures are just reading the slide and makes you want to fall into sleep. Plz don't take any online courses from him...",0
"I'll be honest here, I have never put in as much effort as I did with 116. I went to tutors, I went to the east wing, and numerous other places. I failed this class. Ontop of the confusing subject matter, he tends to ramble in class about barely related topics, such as the history of math. He is a nice guy, and is intelligen, but not a good teacher",0
worst professor I had at SMC; we would go over problems in class and then something totally different would be on the test; worst class ever!,0
"The classes at boring all she does is read of the power point and posts it up on BB. its 3 exams, 1 final, a group projects and presentation which is 9 service learning hours, and a 5pg term paper. she offers extra credit worth 5 points. test are average not too hard, takes forever going over the chapters, behind of schedule for exams.",0
"Exams tricky, not as easy as others say. Some extra credit but don't count on it to save you",0
"Love the professor, but 75% of the final grade depended on exams and only 25% on essays. I did good on the essays, but the exams were hard to get an A on even though they were open noted and it's a 100 level class. I wish the exams & essays were weighted differently or had another component/category to it because the outcome of grades would differ.",0
Hes a great teacher and the study groups are super helpful but hes strict about texting in class and about being there for tests... if you arent there for a test day you dont get to make it up,1
"Professor made taking CORE enjoyable. We tested out a new online textbook for this semester of CORE and he was very lenient with the homework since it was something new. He makes going to this class a breeze. Would definitely recommend, just do the homework, hand in the papers, and you're good.",1
"Gonda is great! She is super sweet and her modules are super organized and quite easy. Just read, view the powerpoints and occasionally write a discussion during her quizzes. Tons of extra credit, only two papers on events you get to choose. Online was only 8 weeks so it moves fast, two modules a week, but totally doable.",1
"Simply the best purveyor of information I've ever been privileged to experience. Professor Hay brought the subject of the Holocaust alive in a way that indelibly imprinted our minds & hearts concerning a subject that needs to be part of any informed 21st century student. Clear and succinct in his delivery; inspirational, gems of info each lecture.",1
"As a professor, Tom really changed my life. His course made me realize my strengths in math and he is very accommodating and encouraging. He cares about his students and that really made me respect him. The course requires some strong writing skills, unlike most math classes, but Tom is always there to help. Thank you, Tom.",1
I don't recommend her if you need extra help. I couldn't understand her very well and her method of teaching made it extremely frustrating. She likes to do the hard way before she shows you the easy way and won't fully answer your question. Even if you're good at math i would still hesitate to take this class.,0
She is a really nice professor. I took her for heritage learners and she does give out a lot of homework. But it's necessary to prepare you for the exams. She is helpful and is willing to work with you if you don't understand something. As long as you do the homework and group projects you're going to pass.,1
Unfortunately he is the only physics teacher at Marist. He CANNOT teach and I don?t know how he lasted this long. All homework is done online and it does factor into your grade...so do it. The homework brought my grade up to a B-. He?s a jerk when answering your questions and makes you feel stupid. You need read the textbook to somewhat understand,0
She's tough if you're a science person and you mostly only write science papers. Her grading especially of essays is close to impossible. More than once she gave an essay and no one received an A. She's really really nice and always helpful at office hours but I would not take her again unless I absolutely had to. Be prepared to work HARD for an A.,1
"nice guy but definitely one of the hardest graders I've come across... he'll comment that what I'm saying in one essay is obvious, then in a different essay tell me that I didn't include enough detail.... okay. i would wait until online classes are over so you have more time to write essays to the standard he expects.",0
Test are long and difficult. He'll provide the information but it's a lot of it and he crams it all in instead of spacing it out.,0
"Professor Wood is very intelligent, this course is difficult. At the start I was doing fine, but I missed handing in a quiz and got a bad score on a test and it didn't look like I was going to pass. She allowed the class to make up one test on our day off, if wanted. I studied hard and got a good score. She is a very tough grader but knows allot.",1
really poor and mean,0
"He was a good guy, I emailed him multiple times outside of class and he would respond within a few hours most times. Hes aware that what hes teaching can be confusing at times and does everything to help students understand it, but you have to ask for the help. Passionate teacher, good energy in class, definitely worth taking the class.",1
"At times, his lectures can be hard to follow, but if you go to office hours he will do his best to help you understand it. or just raise your hand and ask your question during class, he has no problem helping you through the material while he is teaching it. Overall, he is a good professor, but it might take you a week to get used to his accent.",1
His exams are tough so study ahead of time. They are directly from the book so as long as you read and take notes you should be good.,1
horrible grader,0
"Great professor. If you go in interested in political science, you will be even more interested after you leave. While professors often make classes harder than they really need to be, Dr. Grogan makes the difficulty appropriate for an Intro class. Expect to write more, but she isn't a harsh grader.",1
"Her grading is REALLY critical and she will not try to clear up the homework, and will tell you to just read the ""instructions"". I also felt I was being treated as if I was still in middle school. Wouldn't recommend this class.",0
"Does not give feedback on papers except to say wrong or nothing at all. He is easy on the eyes, but that's about it.",0
"I'm not learning a single thing in this class, as I am having to teach myself everything. He does not explain anything well and skips over a lot of information. He is hard to understand and expects us to know things we don't. Exams and homework are nothing alike. I hope I actually pass this class but I'm losing hope. Definitely do not recommend.",0
YOU WILL NOT REGRET TAKING THIS PROFESSOR. I am taking her again for another class!,1
his pre recorded lectures SAVED me for Math 1500. very clear and good explanations. wish there was more practice problems though,1
"I enrolled in Dr. Sundahl's two course IDS 393, God and the American Writer.  The class was like a survey class but the theme was to survey different theological attitudes of American writers from the 17th century to the later 20th century.  The class was, to say the least, inspirational.  Just first rate....",1
Decent teacher but very boring class write everything on over head. Just study for tests for material and she will pass you,1
"This professor is one of the worst I've ever had. Very little in class instruction, we were expected to teach ourselves while she sat back and recovered from her illness. So many assignments and so little time to do them. No instruction either, she expects great work and expects everyone knows how to do what she is teaching already.",0
"I actually don't feel good taking this class. Her presentations are good, But I don't know, It wasn't fun when working with the assignments, they are little headache.",0
"This class was great! Took both semesters of NT with him. He kept it interesting even when it was a 2 hour night class. If you have the option, get him as your teacher!",1
Dr. Solano is very thorough with this course. He opens assignments in myomlab at least a week in advance so there is plenty of time to complete them. His in class lectures are very good as well and he is great with answering questions whether in class or via email. Overall he is a great professor and I would definitely his class again.,1
i didnt find him to be helpful at all,0
"Quizzes were not highly valued, but they poorly reflect the lectures. There's not many chances for evaluation, you must do well on the midterm and final exam. Assignments are to be done on your own, with more than ample time. You must learn each concept on your own, and thoroughly - questions on evaluations are very specific compared to lecture.",0
"No, no, no. Just no. Never take Ralston if you can avoid it.",0
"Embry is a great teacher. His classes are not only interesting in content and because of the way he teaches, but they also seem to inspire a lot of discussion which is great. Some will say it's best to just go with his opinion, but the best response from him came when I argued against him.",1
Great teacher great person.,1
"The WODs in this class are pretty easy and are not interview-level questions so you can just cruise em. The material learned was pretty relevant and was some good stepping stones into REAL software development. NodeJS, MongoDB, and Github are IMPORTANT to learn for a high paying Software job, however, top companies stopped using Meteor yrs ago.",1
"Homework is very difficult.  The tests are even worse.  Makes the course harder than it needs to be.  If you go ask a question, he acts like its a waste of time.  I like the Couve as a guy, but I would never want him as a teacher.",0
The worst for online. She is not a good professor for online courses. We are barely halfway through the semester and we don't know anything STILL. The first exam requires you know the bones BUT THE NOTES AND TEXTBOOK DOES NOT SHOW US. She is very critical and criticizes a lot of your work but can't take criticism back. Anth 300 shouldnt be hard lol,0
Sherri is one of the best math professors she can explain good and I understand what she is saying. Math for me is hard but if you are good in math you should be fine. We get homework every class and we had 3 tests and 1 cumulative final. She does take off a lot of points on things so get ready for that and her lectures are kinda boring,1
I'm not sure why this professor hasn't been fired. He TOOK POINTS AWAY for doing a discussion 4 days before it was due. Doesn't make sense?? They shouldn't be open if he doesn't want students working on them yet. His comments don't make sense. And he never responds to students. Why are people still taking this class? He needs to not teach anymore.,0
maureen is the best teacher at caz,1
"Very hard professor to deal with. She changes due dates, and never, ever gives a project back on time. You can't get her feedback to improve, but she expects you to somehow know exactly what she wants. Grades off of her opinions, even if you meet all of the criteria, you can still get a poor grade. Grading systems WAY off.",0
"Examsmidterm materials do not correspond with majority of class focus, expect surprises on anything that is testable. blows off appointments  with no notice. Is not helpful outside of class and does not usually respond to emails.  He is not the prof you want during your first year transition to university. ",0
"I loved this class. The professor makes his lectures truly interesting and engaging. He's easily the best professor I've had at this school, I definitely recommend his class!",1
"His powerpoints are very boring. He puts true and false trick questions on the tests, so pay very close attention. You are required to see at least one play during the semester, and write an essay over very specific details. The critical responses towards the end of the semester are confusing to understand, watch the videos if you're confused.",0
"he will give you practice exams that have nothing to do with the exam that you're about to take. his practice answers will appear like he's looking for simplified answers but in reality he's looking for specific detailed answers. overall the class was pretty awful, i'd advise avoiding the course.",0
If I wanted to fall asleep I would watch one of his lectures. More boring than watching paint dry.,0
"I would not recommend this Prof to anyone. If possible, take someone else. His grading is near impossible, and he does not seem to understand how to talk to students. This is my major, and I have never had such a horrible history Prof in all seven years of my college experience.",0
"If you have the opportunity to take discrete math with another instructor or to a community college, do so. His teaching style is heavy on his slides which relates NOTHING to the homework. His homework DOES NOT reflect what he teaches in class. I ended up learning discrete math from a YouTuber. This was a waste of time and money.",0
"Can't say enough nice things with the character limit. I took her for A&P 1 and 2 lab and lecture (4 times total). Professor Stevenson wants everyone to succeed, she is really clear with what you need to know and her exams are very fair as long as you study. Anatomy can be a tough course but she does her absolute best, and she's such a sweetheart!",1
"I am currently taking him with my online class and I love the way he responds which is quickly, he thoroughly outlines what he expects, he has so many options available for each chapter if you struggle with understanding a concept. But be prepared to read and do your work.",1
Worse prof ever. You have to get really deep into the textbook to earn marks in exams. Go check other profs on these psychology intro courses.,0
"He really doesnt know how to teach. He never really teaches a topic. 75% of what I learned in his class was from searching the internet, the other 25% I already knew. Don't even think about asking him a question, he will talk out of his ass for 10 minutes trying to sound like he knows what hes talking about so he can get around saying he doesnt kno",0
"The class was more interesting than I expected. If you come prepared to learn and think and work you will do well. Read the assignments, you will get quizzed at the beginning of almost every class. Lots of group work in class but papers are individual. He expects a lot but is willing to help you get there if you ask. He wants students to succeed.",1
"She's nice to you if you don't slack off.  Also, Japanese is at 8:30, 4 days a week for the first the quarters; if you can resign yourself to getting up that early that often you'll survive.",1
The best professor I've ever had - no holds barred.,1
WORST PROFESSOR and very arrogant... No student should have to deal with a professor like this! ,0
Absolutely useless.,0
"Awesome woman, highly recommend her",1
"Here's the thing, he definitely is a nice guy and all but, his midterms were so vague, so many questions that can be answered with yes and no.   Labs required material that were not covered by the lecture, with you having to research everything on your own, wasting a lot of your own time.  Textbook was pretty useless as well",0
"She is nice, but most of the times she would talk about the Cubs game. She tries to make the class fun, and time is not efficiently spent. At times she was not helpful, and would not recommend to everyone. ",0
Finding the important information from the book and notes is much harder than it needs to be. Tons of useless information surrounding the actual material. If you're wanting to follow the book or his notes be ready to read them several times.,0
"She's a good art teacher, the class is always fun and very interesting...she has a dry, sarcastic sort of sense of humor, and she teaches well. We're already getting smarter with all the Mozart she plays! =)",1
"She's very knowledgeable, but somewhere across her career shes saw $ signs instead of actually teaching. She's the head of pace's bsn program, adjunct at Columbia, works at a law firm, works here and there, she does short cuts with her kaltora videos. She doesn't teach, its reflections on rotations, if she gets paid thats all she cares about",0
Professor knows what she is teaching. She gives you ID's every class (like vocabulary words) which is going to be on the midterm(2) and final. need to REALLY study those and this class is a HEAVILY reading class too!!,1
"If you ask him a question, he will send the dryest message ever. The content learned in class does not reflect in the quizzes at all. Not at all engaged with his students. I hope I don't have him as my prof next term.",0
Very nice and helpful. Talks too much about her sexual preference. It is mentioned in nearly every class. Very little prep for assignments in class. Talks only to the students who understand what she is talking about. Exams are difficult.,1
"DON'T TAKE CLASS WITH HIM!  If you want a sense of dignity and want to feel respected as a person, don't take Rogers.",0
"This man has the hardest tests, just do really well on the assignments and you might have a chance at passing. Do all the homework and watch all the lectures and rly understand, because thats all youre going to get from him. Hes nice though like as a human being.",1
First time teaching Photoshop CIS120. Used the book extensively.  Unsure of  how-to stuff.  He moved really fast and tried to please all the Photoshop pros in class instead of teaching an intro class.   I didn't learn much except for the book. Homework was fun so I think he will get  better with experience.,0
"She's really helpful.  If you do ABSOLUTELY all the reading for this class, you'll gain a lot from it.",1
"this man is so ridiculously harsh when it comes to papers it's unreal. i've literally never seen him give an A out. you could iron out as many mistakes in an essay and put your heart and soul into it and he'll give you an A- at best. he's utterly obsessed with ""conciseness"" but poorly defines what that means and often prefers dumbed down sentences.",0
"This class had really interesting course content which was very useful to learn as a CJPP major. However, the professor was very unhelpful when it came to answering questions. The exams were very specific, and nit picky (which was very stressful considering the final was 50% of grade). Would not recommend to other students.",0
Hands down the best teacher I have had. He knows everything about what he is teaching and manages to explain himself very well while maintaining a dry humor. The class is difficult but the marking is fair and it will just take a bit of effort to succeed.,1
Very academic and quite verbose. Opinionated and enjoys debate but rarely willing to concede agreement with the other side--even if they have a good point. Gives thorough explanations and challenging work that makes you think--in a good way. Tough grader.,1
"Great Teacher! Ton of group work but still got a lot of this class. Take him, he makes class enjoyable.",1
"I'm currently in her Survey of Film class and it is not terribly difficult. She lectures for about an hour and the rest of the three hour class you watch a movie. The tests detailed and most of the info comes from her lectures. As for the book reading, it's not mandatory and all I study are the bolded words in the book. Not hard, take her!",1
"It's very disappointing that  EWU continues to employ this professor. He is extremely unprofessional, he even takes pictures of all students on his personal phone without asking permission. If at all possible, take statistics from another professor! He sets you up to fail so work hard and you can pass, the math is extremely easy.",0
"Doesn't so much teach as coach . You'll either like this or hate it. Good, up-to-date papers assigned to read, and if nothing else you'll learn to read papers(!) Each class starts with an often ridiculously hard quiz to see if you read the assigned papers. Nitpicky critique assignments you can't do well on without the right style. Exam was fair.",0
Awful prof. Condescending attitude towards students. Sometimes she messed up her lessons & was corrected by her students. MC tests were horrible. I dropped this class the day before the last drop day. The material was interesting but I don't recommend this class if she's teaching it.,0
"Worst class I have ever been in, your grade will be determined by three impossible tests and problem sets that are worth about 1% of the final grade. He is is all over the place. Problem sets can only be answered using all of his links, good luck with that. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS/PROFESSOR",0
"He's not too bad overall. Doesn't really explain much about the term paper, midterm, or final. His multiple choice questions are really easy; you can cross out a few of the options just by common sense. His lectures are somewhat interesting but they're of not much help for the quizzes. Keep up with the readings. He's a tough marker for written work",0
"Nice man, but the lectures are mostly him reading straight from the PPT, so you end up teaching yourself. Every chapter is usually 120 slides long, so if you do listen to lectures, it takes a while bcuz you're constantly pausing. Office hours were online only, which is hard in a math based course. I'd only take online again if i had no other class",1
Good professor overall. I never liked math and only took the class for gen-ed requirement but the material she goes over is interesting and I did learn some useful stuff from the course. Class went fully online mid semester but she did good job in making things easily accessible. Exam problems are similar to the examples she goes over in class,1
"Harold genuinely cares about his students, and that shows in his meetings with students. I've taken two or three classes from him, and he's fantastic. Classes are tough and will make you work your ass off. I've always learned a ton, though.",1
Goes off on lots of tangents. Make sure you read every single chapter from the book or else you will be lost because he doesn't teach. He only talks about stories from his life. Attendance is taken for part of your grade.,0
"she is really a great teacher. she explains everything very well, The tests are kinda hard, but it you study you should do fine",1
"Dr. Remlinger is a hard grader, that cannot be said enough, but as someone who has had her for 2+ years, she has changed for the better. She listens to her students and offers plenty of help outside of class. She is willing to work with students who meet with her and are active in class.",1
"I took CMB 350, Foundations in Brewing course with Dr. Staves and absolutely loved it! He is very knowledgable and interactive with all students, truly wants you to understand and succeed. This was the fourth semester of the course offered and Im so glad I was apart of it.",1
"Dr. Wight is maybe the best prof I had at Ouachita. He truly cares about his students and, although he is very busy, he will try to make time to meet you 1 on 1 and he is a pleasure to speak with. Neuro was a tough class but I would take it all over again, the material is interesting and Wight keeps you thinking.",1
"Professor Lynch has amazing knowledge regarding not only China but Asia in general. There IS a lot of reading in the course however if you keep up through skimming and focus during the lectures, you will be good to go for the tests. He is a lenient grader. Don't facebook or instagram during class, he will notice and call on you to answer a question",1
His pop quizzes are difficult but he's a solid professor. Marriage & family is an easier class but he brings in real life examples to help connect students to the material. He likes participation and will keep stirring debate to force people to want to talk. He's a tough grader but if you are willing to put in the work I highly recommend.,1
"Course was difficult with a lot of work, but very rewarding because I learned a lot about women in religion. graded on participation, which was hard to do because I found her to be very intimidating,but she is animated and VERY knowledable.  i loved the material, but it was too much, assignments were tough. Came out stronger + smarter though!",1
"Ms Padget is Horrible, This week she taught us how to do MLA formattingn on Work cited pages. This is the second to last week of the class and we were supposed to be doing it all along. She doesnt follow the syllabus and yells at you if you dont do the things on it. She is unclear about everything and cant even answer questions about what she wants",0
HORRIBLE professor. Avoid at all costs.,0
She is still employed at CCRI. She is still difficult and she still threatens students to leave good feedback on this site. Difficult woman. Good luck to you if she is your clinical instructor.,0
"Professor Zimmer is a pretty laid back person. But it can be really hard to get an A if you are not good at drawing. When I entered his drawing 100 class I had no experience, therefore, I struggled to get A's on projects. Although Prof. Zimmer gives good feedback, when you ask for help he may draw on your paper and is not very clear.",0
"Lectures are fast paced, Chooljian goes off on tangents that are irrelevant to the course. She expects you to already know what is on her lecture slides. The time given in the lab exams are so inconsiderate of everyone's learning abilities. You literally get 30 seconds per question. This class will cause anxiety & jeopardize your mental health.",0
Amazing prof! Loved his class! Best university class I've ever taken,1
"Awful. My worst decision in my academic career. I don't know where to start. He has no homework, he has no email so you contact him, his tests are super hard and he changes the dates millions of times, he is hard grader, 1 little mistake  0. Also, he will give you 50 minutes for 4 questions test! What?? Other professors give 2h for easier material",0
"Lab exam days are mandatory and if you miss them there is no chance to make it up. Make sure you do good on the pop quizzes, a bad grade on those will definitely hurt you. Overall, dont slack off in this class and if youre struggling, reach out to her because she didnt reach out to me until I was close to failing her class.",1
So here's the deal: Madsen is dope but this class is not if you're taking it as a lab requirement. An immense amount of material. Take 105 instead!! But madsen rocks and is helpful and caring!,1
"How should I commence with the wonderfulness of this professor? This site wouldn't allow me to type more than 350 language. I would have penned a novel. Take as many of his classes as you can, absolutely astonishing!",1
If you take her class be prepared to teach yourself. Very hard to understand and she does not explain anything.,0
"Best professor I've had. Entertaining and engaging material with straightforward note taking, expectations, and tests. No surprises and understanding of real-world application of knowledge.",1
She was very easy to understand but challenging,1
"This guy never makes a mistake.  Didn't erase a single thing on the board because of a mistake he needed to correct.  Very quirky, but fantastic at mathematics.",1
"Awesome prof, people who are not interested in learning shouldn't take his course. Interesting and wise teacher, ask questions in office hours and get to know him. He has great input and useful tips for the future.",1
Very smart and can be amusing at times which makes the class more enjoyable.,1
odd. and looks like clint eastwood.,0
He's a nice guy I guess but he talks literally incessantly. He goes off on so many tangents that are barely related to the topic at hand and doesn't give anyone else a chance to speak. Three hour class and I think students spoke maybe twice every time. Regretting this class so much.,0
Knows his stuff. He makes the lectures interesting and is an overall great guy. He posts the notes online but makes it so they're confusing if you weren't in class.,1
complaining because he made your class interesting and he didnt read off of a screen?! doty is amazing. you do learn if you pay attention. tells stories from career based on whatever the chapter is about that week. he gives study guide that lays out exactly what is on the test. lets you use one index card for each chapter on test. doesnt get easier,1
"I had Prof Ratna Ray for CCMN 279... and all I can say is she is one of the best educators at Ryerson University. Im quite shocked that she received a low rating here because I think she was excellent. She provided amazing feedback, was willing to review drafts, and was a quick communicator. I would definitely want her as a prof again. She rocks!",1
"The best philosophy professor I had at Pitt.  I found him to be very intersted in his students and eager to help them to learn.  I thought the class was great, and not too hard if you read and study the material.",1
"Davis Houck is an extremely polarizing professor.  Absolutely brilliant guy riddled with arrogance and an authoritative demeanor.  He warns that his class with be an ""uphill sprint"" and the class average will be a C, and he is right.  Essays every week, reading assignments are a must.  YOU CAN SUCCEED, it will just take more effort than ever before",1
"Often late or not in class. Most of semester was in-class activities then in last month had 2 group papers/presentations, 5 homework assignments, and 2 exams. No plan and not clear in directions or answering questions. Changed 20pt extra credit to 40pt regular assignment without telling us. Late grader, did get an A but do not recommend.",0
"I am currently taking her summer class and let me tell you, this is the worst teacher I have came in contact with thus far. when you copy the answers word for word from the lab manual she still finds a way to mark you wrong. You can't come to her and ask her questions because she will brush you off and have you ask someone else. AVOID her",0
"Professor Weinstock knows a ton about marketing, but he makes it so difficult for students to do well. If you're looking to get into marketing whether that be a major or minor, don't start your first class off with him. You'll find yourself discouraged and frustrated by the end. Stay away unless you absolutely have to take him. It's not worth it.",0
"This professor is so suck and he can't teach me anything, his laboratory is so difficult and hard to finish. So, PLEASE DON'T CHOOSE HIS CLASS!!!!!",0
"Amazing man, terrible professor. He is kind, caring, and hilarious, but does not know how to teach in the least. This class was the biggest waste of time. I can't believe this is what my tuition went to.",0
"Professor Belus' online Literature and Culture class was really interesting. Easy to get an A if you do the work. Every week we read a book, did a discussion board about it, and took a short quiz. Grades are posted quickly. Readings are required to be able to respond to the discussion board prompts, but nothing is too hard and it's a fun class.",1
Laurel Roberts is fantastic. Lectures are so engaging and tests are very fair. She is very encouraging.,1
"After taking a long break from school, I'm glad I had Prof Blair coming back to academia. Prof Blair prepares her students to be ready to critically think through ideas, situations, and real world issues. It was an honor to have my creativity, thinking, and writing skills mentored under Prof Blair; and I'm sure you'll have a similar experience.",1
Saas was an awesome professor. He was very laid back and was really lenient. He really does care about his students. He wants everyone to pass. This class is an easy A. Literally just do what is asked of you and turn it in on time and you'll get an A. Not a hard class at all. He's also really funny.,1
"This online creative writing class had no right to be this difficult. Virtual meetings through 'Second Life' were mandatory to attend like a in-person class. Extremely tough grader. If you don't write the specific style he thinks you should, he will doc you. Too much hw for a 200 class. Several assignments a week. Won't ever take again.",0
"Good teacher, but you get what you put into the class. He will help you if you are willing to learn. If you need help, just ask. He doesn't usee mymathlab, but does use the textbook. He does not grade homework.",1
Her online class was well organized. Assignments were crystal clear and she is a very fair grader. She makes mini audio lectures on specific topics which really help. A great class -- work load minimal. Tests are open book in online class!,1
Expect a pop quiz every class and about 5 exams and a weekly online quiz. He covers a new chapter per class. If you fall behind your in trouble. Just show up try to pay attention and do your work and BOOM you get an A.,1
"Absolute gem... Take Bonney whenever the opportunity presents. Smart guy, funny, and won't mess up your GPA",1
"Ed's a great prof! He is funny and very approachable outside class. He tries to make lecture content interesting by intersecting a few jokes. His exams are fair but a little too long so they end up tough. He gives a lot of pre and in-class exercises to help you keep on top of the material. My only complaint would be, he talks fast so be prepared.",1
"Course was a 1 credit hour course but treated like it was a 3 credit hour course. There were 3 assignments, all incredibly long. Lectures were quite boring, but unnecessary as he posts his notes on his site.",1
"Mr. Goodyear is an excellent teacher with great values.  Very interested in his students success, is very helpful during and after class.  Very well spoken, relatable,and humorous. He is a great teacher!",1
"Corson is an awesome teacher! He wants you to learn and do well. He and Diana will do whatever it takes to ensure you receive an A+. As he always says "" We are friends, and friends don't let friends fail, as long as you keep up your end of the bargain""",1
A very passionate professor whose only goal is to open the eyes and brains of his students.  Someone who teaches for the right reasons.,1
"Doc is the most unprofessional professor I have ever had. I had missed a few classes due to vacation, however, stayed up with my studies and was doing fine in the class. A day after my return, he sends an email stating I needed to drop the course due to being gone. When I went into his office to discuss his email, he berated me. Worst Professor. ",0
"Professor Buckridge was my favorite professor that Ive had. His lectures were engaging, he was funny, and I learned so much. You have to work for your grade, but an A is obtainable.",1
"She makes every student accountable for what they do in the classroom. If you don't show up to class on a consistent basis, she makes you accountable for that as well. Thank you so much, for your lectures, group work, and assignments. I will put the word out, that everyone should want to take your class. It'll change their life. It changed mines!",1
"She's incredibly cool, Spanish and languages just happen to be something I'm not all that great at, super understanding though. Does Test Reflections so you can get more points, gives tons of tutoring and resources for more. Even if you're utterly horrid at Spanish like me if you work decently hard you'll do good in this class.",1
Linguistics disguised as Anthropology. Isn't that clever.... and a waste of my money. Really nice guy until you get to know him.,0
"Very stressful class. Requires a LOT of studying. He only grades the tests, but I recommend you do the homework. Ask a lot of questions. I studied over 12 hours for the second exam, and only got an 86 on it. This class requires a lot of time put into it. Make sure you go to class.",0
"Three exams, no HW. Practice problems arent provided (unless counting the Shaum book on the sylabus where you can find said problems yourself). Material that is basically review from undergrad with a little extra ompf + straight forward questions on exams + terrible ""teaching""  extremely difficult & stressful exams.",0
"I enjoyed David Gabriel as a prof. The course is very challenging and stimulating, but overall I think he taught the class well and made the midterm, term assignment and final very fair. ",1
"Super nice, funny guy, but not good at lecturing. Examples given in class and in Sapling are WAY easier than exams. However, study the practice exams for a good idea of what to expect. WARNING! A lot of unseen problems pop up in every exam so there's a limit-unless you're really smart.",0
She's excellent,1
He is a real gem! Amazing prof!!! Not many assignments and a really easy grader. Attendance is not mandatory! Just review his study guide before the exam and you will pass. He is really funny during his lecture and really fun attending class. LOVE IT. He really cares about his students !!,1
His final was so long. You would have needed excel to complete it and he did not even mention the use of excel.,0
"Strong accent, hard to understand",0
"His programming assignments took hours, were unexciting, and were often taken directly from Microsoft's examples.  His teaching style was going directly over code, word for word.  This class was especially painful because, as a game programming class, it could have been fun.",1
She is by far the worst teacher I have ever had!  She goes through the material very fast; the problems we do in class to practice are nothing like the problems on the test.  I think she intentionally tries to confuse everyone.  Do not take her if you don't have to!,1
Quite possible the worst teacher I have ever encountered. He has a vast understanding of the content but little to no skills to convey his knowledge clearly and in an understandable manner. Lectures are often empty and his slides are confusing and often have little to no explanation.,0
Oh Deb fels. Turned my multimedia in business class into the depths of hell.  no. bueno. ,0
EASY A,1
"Avoid!!Maybe for the ECON 1010/1020 he would be ok. The book which he assigned was absolute garbage, his lectures are dry, he also graded very hard with little to no feedback as if this is a graduate level course. Only made it through about half the course material due to garbage time management. Tends to explain questions by going off on tangents",0
"This guy knows a lot about Interpersonal Communication.  He gives excellent examples and makes sure that everyone participates.  You will love his class.  Sometimes, I was not willing to participate, but he made me participate.",1
I tried really hard to follow the lectures but in the end I had no clue what was going on.,0
"Dr. Collier took over this class for another professor who passed away. He is intelligent but is not personable. Grading is very hard but seems fair when feedback is given, however this is rare. For instance, on my final writing assignment I received only 2 comments on the entire paper. He stuck to the syllabus and course schedule. Do not recommend",0
"While hilarious, he is very caught up in his own scattered thoughts.  No ""lecture"".  Class usually consisted of him speed-reading various portions of chapters in the book aloud. We were meant to intrinsically know what material will be on tests.  Gave off the vibe he did not want to be there.  I often left wondering why I bothered to show up.",0
Prof Fanzone is a great instructor. The complainers just don't want to work and expect the class to be like high school.,0
"She's an excellent prof, understood material well, gave class many breaks, explained things clearly. The course is hard, the professor is good.",1
"Took this class for my minor. Honestly made me start to hate Shakespeare. Lots of material to cover in 16 weeks, not much time to adequately cover each play. Felt like there was too much to do. He's knowledgeable for sure, but a very picky grader. Papers are also insanely long and difficult if you don't fully understand each play.",1
"Terrible experience. Very unorganized and lacks the necessary communication skills to teach remotely. Whole grade is based on 2 tests taken in a totally different format than 3rd party software she uses to ""teach"". Unreasonable expectations, passive aggressive emails, no passion. She doesn't care and it shows-don't waste your time/money.",0
"Do not expect a good grade. HSS2121 is made up of mostly HSS students with science backgrounds, her whole course seemed to intend on proving that Social Sciences are better. She emphasizes the importance of critical thinking over grades but then tests on memorization solely for the midterms. The final was fair but did not make up for the midterms.",0
"New Testament - I actually enjoyed his class, but it was ridiculously difficult for a 100 level class. He is very knowledgeable, but would be better off teaching at a seminary. Unless you are looking to minor in religious studies, you'd be better off to find easier classes than this one to fill your humanities requirements.",1
"I have taken a philosophy class before and I absolutely failed. Attended 99% of the classes and even got an 80 on our first quiz. HE ABSOLUTELY FAILED ME ON EVERYTHING ELSE. I actually didn't know it was possible to get a grade in THE TEENS. His lectures are awful, and his notes are disorganized and almost in another language. SAVE YOURSELF THE F!",0
My advisor and professor,1
"Embarrassed me in front of my whole class by using a piece of my essay (not before completely editing it to make it unclear and confusing) and then promptly told the whole class that I make her job hard. Stuck in her older generational ways and thinks young people are pessimistic. $130+ text book, no time to write drafts/essays",0
"He got phone calls in the middle of class almost every time. He would ignore your questions. His TA didn't know how to complete most the HW questions. Would go through examples in class that had nothing to do with the HW. He seemed out of breath most days. But I guess he knows R pretty well, if that is what makes you a good teacher.",0
She was unclear about instructions.  Would not take her class again.,0
Gives a lot of detail and examples in lecture. Prone to tangents and rants. Her tests are challenging but she tells you exactly what type of problem will be on the exam.,1
"She's a caring teacher and she will help you if you are having trouble. I struggle when it comes to Math. Mrs. M is a strict teacher however, if you work hard she is very kind. She let me have extra time to complete my tests and appreciated how hard I worked. I earned a B and I worked for it but she was kind to me.",1
His study guides that he gives you before tests prepares you for what is on the test. He is very interactive and uses youtube/videos a lot too. He's fun and very hot!! I'm going to miss him.,1
"I took Alice's online statistics class. The expectations were very straight forward, but there was a lot of work for one summer session. Online homework and quizzes/ tests were due for each section of the book through the the book's website. She provided her lessons through canvas and links to videos and worksheets which were helpful.",1
"as you wish, his company went down...",0
"Very controversial and offensive about religious matters in class, almost like he thinks he is God. Woody West has a very difficult class and it is nearly impossible to do well unless you sacrifice your life. It seems like he is looking for perfection I would never recommend him.",0
"A little confusing, but his class was a great experience. You will not understand any of the assignments, but you will have fun in his class.",0
"Lots of work and definetly wants you to agree with her.  As stated before if you just spit back on paper what she explains in class, you will do fine if you want to take her.",1
"Just a warning, he doesn't use blackboard at all. Doesn't even bother to set it up. Definitely takes attendance, but is never on time for class. His lectures are very hard to follow as he goes on tangents quite often, so my advice if you take him is to keep all papers he passes out and just use sparknotes and you'll be fine!",0
"He doesn't teach the class to prepare you for the exams. He teaches the class to prepare you for graduate level math. This is not an easy class by any means and in fact he makes it difficult by including these difficult concepts. ""The class GPA was 2.49. The class GPA for the last MAP 2302 section I taught (Fall 2016) was 2.32"" (from his webpage)",0
"I had a teacher say once that in math and chemistry if teachers use scantrons they are just lazy and that is so true. This gy uses all scantrons so it doesn't matter if you really know this stuff but make a minor calculation error you still get no credit for what you do know. Take from Hodge, his tests let you show what you've learned.",0
"Has high expectations, knows the topic, and genuinely cares if you're understanding the material he's presenting.",1
"Brown is THE WORST professor I have ever had. He singled out all Athletic Training Students and told us our major is useless. He also knocked our grades lower than  exercise science students. In front of the class, he told us we were dumber than everyone else. He won't admit he's wrong and doesn't know basic anatomy. Do not take class with him.",0
"She is really great. Well organized with notes and power points. As long as you take the notes, the test and essays are easy. Highly recommend her.",1
"I did not have her for a class, but I did choose to meet with her to go over my schedule for Fall. She was not friendly AT ALL and talked to me like I didn't do any research. I have known what I wanted to do with my life for so long and I understand it would not be easy, yet she discouraged me & told me i need to rethink my path. DO NOT TALK TO HER",0
"Karen I would say is a below-average professor. Her lab class is boring, she she makes no effort at least that I can see to make it more fun, interesting, and engaging. Worst thing about her though is that she thinks she knows everything and it shows in the way she talks down to other students.",0
"A last resort prof. His theory class/ lectures are not sufficient, and the only way to pass is to avoid relying on the lecture.",0
"There are six quizzes required, but your top five quizzes are kept and counted for your final grade. He also gives you the opportunity to better your grade at the end of the semester by having three optional extra credit essays. I wouldn't say that the work and quizzes are easy; if you don't read his lectures it will show in your grade.",1
"Mr. Lloyd is a very tough grader who unfortunately isn't very clear on assignments. He has no problem humiliating students by showing their papers to the class as an example of what no to do. He also pulls up previous students Facebook's to make fun of them.  If you want a teacher to be supportive or helpful, Lloyd isn't the guy.",0
"Easy A if you aren't as lazy as I am. No class on Fridays (in addition to there barely being class any other day). Just do your assignments and unlimited attempt quizzes at home when you feel like it but BEWARE, turning in assignments late can cost you. Only 2 exams and they were both easy 100s. Deff one of the easier classes i've ever taken.",1
Terry was a fantastic teacher.  I would recommend him for anyone taking a creative writing class.  He had helpful suggestions for people at every level of development in our class (there was a wide range.) This was the one class I looked forward to going to all term.,1
Dr Ronan is a great instructor.  Yeah sometimes he rambles but for the most part I enjoyed his lectures.  He talks about the real world not just what is in the book.  Always helpful and you can tell that he is very intelligent.   He was always willing to talk after class if he wasnt heading out the door right away.,1
hate this class! test are hard. studying is a MUST with lots of outside help. doesnt give out OLD powerpoints. Rambles.,0
Class is boring and hes very forgetful.,0
"Well, I almost died of boredom when in his class.  He's quite competent but his teaching isn't the best.  This guy is no ""Anthony Robbins"", so get through the class on your own motivational skills!",0
She is very demeaning to students in class and is one of the most unhelpful professors that I have ever had. If you can avoid taking a class from Aurore Victor then I would strongly suggest it.,0
"This class is a very easy pass as long as you show up.  YOU ARE GRADED ON ATTENDANCE.  There are zero tests the entire semester- no final!  He gives several homework assignments throughout the semester that are worth a large chunk of points, but gives plenty of time to complete them.  He is a very easy grader and an overall fun guy.  Take him!",1
Omg!I have lots of things to say here!He is the worst class ever in my life!It was horrible!He is very unfair and he expects his students to be professional!He is not helpful and his explanation is difficult to understand!He should know how easy other lab class was at least!It is very unfair!I really hated this class!he is hard grader. Very bad!,0
"I took his online based class. He is straightfoward. You have to do all the work but that consists of submitting a 1-2 page paper on what you think of something weekly. Videos on the net were a great watch. 10 Page Final Paper on a modern work of art. still ok, he outlines everything. EASY 3 CREDITS TO SATISFY YOUR Art/Science req. for Stillman!",1
"HORRIBLE professor. She's very unclear, hard to follow her lectures. Tests are hard & she purposely tricks you, its NOT type of problems on the study guide or classwork. Im great in math & had a very hard time to keep an A cuz of her teaching style. I had to teach myself almost everything & went to other professors for help. DO NOT TAKE HER",0
"Nice guy but I hate his class. A lot of homework and projects. Also, have a midterm and final. he grades really harshly and ridiculous. If you're not very familiar with excel and access microsoft don't take his class.",0
"Amazing professor, really cares about the subject and the students. Knows a lot about what he's teaching. Don't text or use your phone in class, he will call you out on it.",1
"Little to no help with assignments, no reply through e-mail, constantly arrives late, & blows off anyone with questions after class. I was lost from the beginning because the concept of law baffles me. He didn't make it any easier. Nice guy and all (and funny), but as a professor he's not getting  a high rating from me.",0
very boring lecture. does not teach concepts well.,0
"Dr. Allison is the man. I always looked forward to his lectures. The material is engaging and relevant, whether youre a special ed concentration or not. The class is easy to understand but you still have to work for the A and take good notes. I would definitely take him again. Best college class Ive taken so far!",1
"She does not explain text clearly so it is understandable. Doesn't finish explinations, examples, or sentances.  Luckily she doesn't grade too hard but be prepared to read the book and teach yourself.",0
"Dr. Tulsian is by far the worst professor I have had in my entire life. Not only does he openly insult students, but he also is extremely rude and vulgar during lecture. This professor has ruined physics for many in the class, including myself.  I would suggest to take Physics with Calculus elsewhere AT ALL COSTS",0
Not sure what happened with him and our class but he was very passive aggressive - openly mentioned a few times how he was surprised our class didn't know how to graph hyperbolas. Also has a particular aggressive tone when asking for his help after class. Our class had a mutual dislike with him. Don't know what happened.,0
"Great professor, came to class prepared and rarely messed up in lectures. Lectures were engaging. Was available outside of class, even outside his office hours. Glad to have had him for my first proofs based course.",1
"SAP quizzes aren't bad if you practice a lot before, homework also isn't bad if you follow along. However, there are two exams that average at 70-75%. I don't understand profs who are okay with that low of an average. Reading quizzes are hard even if you take notes, so read over it multiple times. Overall I suggest taking a different prof.",0
Don't know how to teach an online class! Best you can get on discussion are 18/20 and even those are hard to get. You can reply to every ones post and prob. still not get a 20/20!,1
"CHEM 101, which Ive heard is lots of fun in person, has been turned into the most unorganized mess that I have ever taken part of, and its all thanks to Yoram. This is the fifth online lab that I have taken and it was by far the worst, basically just a few handouts and an 8 question, 30 minute exam that is worth the majority of the grade.",0
Absolutely terrible teacher and human being alike. Here are some bullet points: - 3 hour labs take 8 hours (no joke) - Bullies students who ask questions - Weekly assignments take 6-8 hours (if you are fast) - Refuses to help students he doesn't like - No industry experience - Expects you to know everything in the textbook (but never uses it),0
"she is teaching a class called technology and culture but she hardly knows anything about technology, she needs to stick to the subject way too much talk on gender we already have a class on that its called ANTH 125, her lectures are made for jr high kids not college kids but she expects us to know everything for the exams,",0
"I had internet section. Need book, need $50 terrible software to do homework assignments on. This class is straightforward. Go online. Find her review for the test. Get out your book and fill in the definitions, etc. Study the review and you have a good grade. Comprehensive final of definitions mostly.",1
Prather patted my back. I finally felt like I had a father. Tough because he cares.,1
"Good person,means well, his style of teaching is old school. I kept falling a sleep in his class, all he did was talk for 1:30 no student interaction.",1
Her test are hard and you really do not know what is going to be on them and the amount of poems and other things you have to memorize for the test are way to much. Also the test are short so if you miss a few then you grade drops fast.,0
One of the best professors at York. Loved his class so much I'm taking another with him in the winter.,1
"go to lab, get a good TA",1
This class is very hard but professor Aunave is such a sweetheart and helped me as much as possible. As a student taking French for the first time I would say it was extremely difficult even though I made my best effort. Its a small class with lots of talking and group activities. She can tell if your really trying and will grade accordingly. ,1
"This was a great online class! There is a quiz and a discussion every week (usually). And you must raise a virtual child. The weekly quizzes are open book and extremely easy. A 15 min scan before the quiz and good use of the glossary should suffice. Discussions take no more than an hour to complete per week. The virtual child was intriguing and very simple to do. There is a great amount of extra credit available! I got a 96%, easy! Prof. Orme really cares about the students and was flexible!",1
"Had Mook for both Dynamics and Dynamic systems. Probably the most helpful professor I've had, but he does make you work for your grades -- quizzes at random, and at least one per topic. Honestly wish he taught more of the higher level courses, but that would just make it too easy.  TL;DR: Show up to class, ask questions when lost, get A. ",1
"I was looking forward to this class and fully regret taking it! I am not a left on my own kind of learner. I need engagement and support but felt like I got zero, even when I emailed asking for assistance. If you are exceptionally strong in English, go ahead and take a chance but if you want to learn or refresh you'll be on your own to do so.",0
"Awesome professor, twin of Reid Spencer from Criminal Minds. Advisor of more than double the number of students than any other professor. Super class, which makes you understand the material better than a common lectures! He is ""Da Man""!",1
Awesome teacher she kept me interested so I actually learned...  Pay attention in class and you get an A in the class,1
"If you're not a math or science major DO NOT take it with this guy. Guy can't speak english, offers no help, and doesn't explain his grading system. I've had great experiences with other teachers in the math department but not him.",0
"Great class, great teacher, fair grader... he'll keep your attention and will engage your interest.",1
"I was a freshman while taking his course though I felt as though it was a class level more appropriate for seniors. Funny, interesting, very organized, and very hard! My biggest complaint would be that his paper prompts are very broad but when he grades he marks you down for missing things he never asked for.",1
"Even though I have failed, he was  decent. Maybe the lectures were boring and all and the tests were really hard but he made himself available for anyone that needed help and help us to make a study guide. He isn't bad.",1
"I would recommend taking this course online. He's a great professor. One paper was due a week. Use the book to know what is expected in the paper. For the final paper if you make all the corrections he pointed out you, you will do well on the final. ",1
"No one has inspired me more than Professor Austin. This semester he was on sabbatical, which made me very sad. Each day I would sit at the table outside his office hoping he'd stop by, but he never appeared. My life has been empty without him.",1
"This is an Intro to Java class. Coming from not knowing any Java, I quite enjoyed it. She is usually late to class and it seems like there isn't any lesson plan she follows. Takes awhile for her to grade things. Codelab is a waste of time so just get the answers off the internet. Expect to spend a lot of time later in the term on assignments.",0
"She doesn't email back, the tests don't make sense most of the time, and the whole ""flip the classroom"" thing is super confusing and doesn't help with actually learning.",0
"Pretty easy class if you've already taken a lot of science classes like I had. He does a great job of spelling out the entire semester from day one. No need to buy the textbook; everything you need to know for the quiz is on the study guide. Lecture tends to drag, but it's only once a week. I wish he taught more classes. I would take him again.",1
"He certainly made up majority of my Cooper experience. Best math teacher I ever encountered, especially on combinatoric stuff. Hopefully he'll come back to give some short seminars.",1
"A lot of people will tell you that Costa's 384 is the hardest class you'll take in ECE, and they may be right. Homeworks are long and harshly graded. Exams are very intimidating, but doable.  Decent professor when it comes to explaining but the material can be annoying to learn. Projects aren't too difficult, but overall this class is a lot of work",1
"I Totaly agree with other comments below. Great guy, BUT can't teach. Make you look like stupid when you ask question. Wont grade HomwWorks.",0
"Course is easy! Professor is absolutely terrible, and for the final makes you hand write out the problems and copy scan to her.",0
"He prefaced the class with sending out an email stating that he wasn't responsible for teaching the class, which is exactly what he delivered. Just learn from the book if you take the class with him. He's also a complete ****, so I wouldn't take the class with him if that'll bother you.",0
"I took him in a seminar, History of Technology. It was the only com class I could get into, but it wasn't that bad. his lectures are more like discussions. He is a somewhat funny guy, and is really into the topic. There wasn't that much work. He made us buy a 105 year old magazine as our ""textbook"" but it was really interesting.",1
"There are literally 8 grades in the entire class and if you do the ""extra credit"" he drops your SECOND lowest quiz. He talks forever and you cannot even follow it because he is goes off on tangents. You will NEVER get out early. Do not take him unless you want your life to be a living hell.",0
Just my humble opinion. I think she is average. I did not really understand the proofs in her class and did not really learn much from her. Learn the most by reading her notes and the textbook or by doing the questions. She is one of the most organized teacher I've seen so far. She sometimes gives the lecture notes for the upcoming weeks in advance,1
"very helpful, goes out of his way to help you",1
Dr. Dean is the best!! Had him for two classes in my freshman year. He really cares about his students. He's a legend around campus and everyone knows him. He really inspired me to continue in PR. He always starts class off with a joke or funny story. Attendance is very important if he sees you're trying he will help out with your final grade.,1
"Pretty tough class attendance is mandatory and exams are impossible unless you study the powerpoints and connect problems. there is extra credit, she is definently a solid teacher and I would recommend her",1
"It all comes down to a great professor. (Wish i had him for lab too) He makes silly jokes like ATP and kcal9. And I STILL remember them. And that's the point. His lectures aren't boring but memorable. He makes chemistry fun and understandable. Easy A if you just try! Seriously, I'm an English major and he was able to make everything easy to grasp.",1
"He does not realize that we are not in the 1970s anymore and is absolutely a terrible professor. All he does is rant about how ""handheld devices"" have changed our society. Class is a complete waste of time.",0
"He class was interesting and I had a lot of fun. He is definitely one of the best instructors I had. His class was always well organized, which I really like. He cared about student's performance in class and always gave feedbacks to our assignments. Be sure to read the material in advance, it will be easier to participate in class discussions.",1
"Your grade is 15 quizzes, and that's it. The textbook is filled with typos and a lack of explanation, which makes teaching yourself really difficult. He is impossible to reach and won't respond to any emails. He makes the work wayyyy more difficult and complex than it should be to learn how to do simple stats.",0
"Going into tests I never felt very prepared and found myself guessing on many questions but managed to get As on the first two exams. Did not help me decide if I want to declare my major in Advertising, which I was hoping this intro class would've done. Not many notes taken in class so it is up to you to read textbook.",0
there is no homework in this class so your entire grade will be based of exams. First exam I got an F but that motivated me to study harder and ended up passing the class. Usually half of the class will drop. You need to study to pass. Textbook was not used.,1
"Dr. Finucane teaches like he's telling a story, which makes the material easier to remember and much more interesting. I actually learned about theology, not the textbook, upper-level info that a lot of other professors make their students learn. He actually wants us to learn and cares about his students so much.",1
"Professor Miller is one of the best Statistics teachers at Pace.  Do not take him if you are not a serious student. He explains very clearly and is very caring. If you can not handle a simple stat class. let's face it ,you do not belong at Pace.",1
"Super nice and educational professor. He definitely knows what he's talking about which makes it hard for a student in an intro class. He goes on tangents that are hard to follow because you don't know the content he is talking about. Super, super nice and supportive, just wouldn't recommend for a 100 level class.",0
"Just got out of her 1 credit pilates class and it was the worst I have ever been in. I work out and have done step reebok and other classes and this by far was the worst. It wasnt the class, its the teacher. She ruined my GPA, she tests hard and has too much work for a 1 credit class. Also, unless you are a ""danceer"" she will fail you.",0
"Definetly the worst class I have taken at LVC, she expects entirely too much from a 100 level course. Avoid this professor if possible!",0
"Prof. Lichtman is awesome! He explains the material very well, and he really cares about his students. He wants them to learn what covered in class. He gives many assignments, and the final is a lot of writing but not hard at all. Very interesting class if you want to learn!!",1
absolutely useless!,0
"Easiest class I've ever taken. Didn't read one of the books he assigned. Can google everything and get by. A lot of writing but hes a lenient grader, very open minded",1
one of the best economics prof in thsi university...,1
"Will give you a good foundation for knowledge as long as you go to class. He posts useful supplementary lecture notes which will also help you get a good footing. If you do not take consistent notes, you will be in a pile of trouble. Tutorials are really useful so make sure to get your bearing.",1
"Dr. Schellhorn definitely cares about her students, and she helped me with some confusions during office hours. However, I think that something she could have done better is making the material more interesting, and conveying it in such a way that students can understand. She is helpful one-on-one, but her lectures can be hard to follow.",1
"Dr. Ptak does a great job at getting you to think about the lesson in new and interesting ways - and he's a great, approachable, and caring person too. Class was fun and engaging, and I really learned to think more carefully and analytically about my thought process. That said, I wish the class was more organized and that he graded faster.",1
"I'm a math major and for me, this class was hard yet not impossible. There's a lot of hw and quizzes every week. My advice to you is that you should watch videos for every topic you don't understand, do examples from each section and then do the exercises&hw. That is what I did and I did well in this class. It takes a lot of time but it's worth it.",1
"Fantastic professor!!!! Best professor I have had at the university so far. She is very enthusiastic about the material which helps student find an interest in the subject matter. The tests are not difficult, they are mostly reiteration of material from the readings/notes with a little application. Overall a great course with an awesome professor!!",1
"Great professor. Homework was pretty average. If you read and do what you're supposed to, you should pass, no problem. She requires a discussion board per chapter, which I found to be annoying, especially for the assigned topic. I would, however, take a class from her again. Overall a solid professor choice.",1
"This professor was horrible. Her grading is impossible. She isn't clear on her expectations and will take off massive points on little errors. Have to hand in case brief every few weeks, there is 2 writing assignments and 2 tests. Her classes are all powerpoint lectures and she is kind of rude and belittling.",0
"So some people say that those who don't like Roman just weren't ready to work for a good mark, which is fair for some. But as someone who went into the final with an A+ and feels as though it went well, I can still say he is bad at his job. He doesn't teach the course well, just reposts old lectures. Basically had to teach myself everything",0
Li Gao is the worst professor Ive ever taken. He writes on the board and lectures to the board. His accent is pretty thick took me all semester to get use to. Do not take him. He makes consistent mistakes on the board and his posted online notes are not similar to lectures in class at all.,0
so glad she's gone! she was the worst feminist i've ever heard. she only preached things one way. she would walk out of class if someone's phone went off but would answer hers when it rang. also came late or just didn't show up to class frequently. she annoyed the heck out of me,0
Mrs. Procter hands out note packets before each lecture and there is a quiz every week and after each lab. Her study guides have little to do with the quizzes and she makes them more difficult that they need to be. She makes you stay after lab and would be better off teaching high school. Study hard or you wont pass.,1
"Boring tedious nonsense. More reading than anything else, and when I could drag myself to lecture I'd inevitably fall asleep. I've never met any one else with the uncanny ability to make you yawn during the most fascinating of stories.",0
One of the easiest classes I have ever taken. Had three tests and I would guess the class average was an A on all of them. Tells you exactly what is going to be on exam as it comes right off the study guide. Also makes class fun and enjoyable. One of my favorite classes. TAKE DR Z,1
"*This course was taken during the Spring 2020 Covid-19 pandemic* Prof. Davidovitch would be much better suited to teach graduate level courses than a second-year physics course. His lectures were confusing and too fast-paced, assuming students already knew more than they did. A great person, but made the course material too difficult.",0
"absolutely, beyond a shadow of a doubt useless. there are no words to adequately describe this guy's sheer incompetence at any sort of instruction. can't enunciate clearly enough to speak to someone 10 feet away, treats students with 0 respect, overall worst human being i have ever had the misfortune of dealing with. i don't know how he keeps a job",0
"Lots of opportunities for extra credit (up to 30 points), you get an 8x11 cheat sheet  on each exam and she gives partial credit. For the plant tour project, make sure your group has the best report or you will not do well. My group was marked down for things that were not in the rubric. Lots of homework and quizzes, but only 5 out of 8 count.",1
do not take his class,0
"A 20-point curve is added to each assignment. The highest test average was a 60, and all other tests had an average below 60. He is extremely hateful when a question is asked- regardless of the question. As a student who has succeeded in every aspect of college, this man lowered my self-esteem.",0
BEST. PROFESSOR. EVER. This man really cares about his students. he is brilliant and inspiring. best best best!!!,1
"Good teacher, however he has a decent amount of lectures and discussions.  As long as you pay attention and participate youll be perfectly fine.",1
"Very nice, and agreeable.  Better to have her during the semester rather than Winter session.",1
Learned more in this class than in any other class I've taken so far. She relates the material to life experiences that make it so much easier to remember and understand. Extra credit for working with kids at elem. school.  Extremely rewarding. Mrs. Mattox is one of those rare teachers you hardly ever find anymore. Would be dumb not to take her!,1
"If you are somebody who has a lot going on in your life and need a bit of slack, then do not take a course with her, she denied my request for an extension.  Needed a dr. note or to go see a counselor.  She is cold and serious during lectures, difficult and intimidating to talk to.  I loved the course content, but I despise her teaching methods.",0
"Do not take her, take another professor f possible. she does not even teach correctly, it is more of a self learning class",0
"Professor Higley is engaging and is clearly passionate about the materials taught in the class. The only thing I disliked was the way that she acted towards students, as she can sometimes be very moody and impatient with them. All in all, a very good course. I would take a class with her again just for her outstanding abilities in teaching.",1
"Complete hypocritical jerk shows up late literally everyday but the one time he is on time he takes 3 points off grade for being absent, arrogant, totally disrespectful, picks favorites, has absolutely no problem breaking rules to punish a student because he doesn't like them personally, thinks and brags so highly of himself he's a P. Of S.",1
"This Professor is straight to the point, with what she expects from the students, out of the class. Whatever work that you do, is the grade that you earn. She is preparing us for the real world, and all of the challenges that come with it. Thank you! I will definitely considering taking another class with you, in the future.",1
"Professor Bunn is extremely knowledgeable in accounting and is available during office hours if you do not understand something. Accounting can be tough, but he made it easy to understand. Would take him again for other accounting classes.",1
"He's a nice guy and knows his stuff; however, not cut out for teaching. Another teacher (head of dept maybe?) sets what he teaches and I feel this is a downfall for him. Teacher needs to use his own lessons to teach the required information. If you actually want to learn something, take a different class. Looking for just a grade? Take his class.",0
"He was hilarious and made it a joy to attend his lectures. Although there was a lot of textbook reading, the information is pretty interesting!",1
"Svillen is easily the best teacher in the entire program. If you have any problems with the course, talk to him and he will go out of his way to make sure you do well.",1
awesome prof....take MIS with him if you can,1
"thinks very highly of herself.  marks unfairly.  the discussions can be interesting, but that's dependent on intelligent students.  sucharov herself doesn't seem to have ever operated outside a university.",0
"I was very disappointed with Brownsey's class. Despite his painfully repetition, he was very hard to follow. His humour was nice at the start of the semester, but it became culturally racially insensitive. I found Brownsey to be quite rude when I asked for help. Overall, not the most interesting or professional teacher. ",0
Does not seem to understand the material during lecture times and does not go over the material to make sure you understand. Not the best professor!,0
He seems like a good professor but when it comes to his online class the experience was horrendous. His papers are very specific and if you don't meet one criterion it's very difficult to get the grade you want. Such a tough grader and if you ask for help he seems like he doesn't care. The only good part is his flip grid discussions.,0
"one of the worst profs i ever met he is soo boring staying awake in his lecture is impossible ,the starting material is not bad then it gets hard his midterm was really easy but the FINAL WAS SOOOO HARD  i have no idea where he got it from .AVOID AT ALL COSTS",0
His classes are tough and difficult to follow. He is biased towards specific identities and lacks any sort of cultural competency when working with a diverse student population. Can be very disrespectful to students and faculty. ,0
He's an average professor but his voice his pretty monotone and his enthusiasm leaves al ot to be desired. Then again it's hard to make the course he teaches really interesting so I can't fault him.,0
Treats students like they should know the material already and if you don't makes you feel stupid for not knowing it.,0
"Not a fan! He was quite rude to the TA and consistently talked down to them. He has a habit of coming off quite condescending and isn't a fan of repeating himself. I did find the course itself interesting so it wasn't a complete waste, I just would avoid another class with him in the future.",0
JPOW THE BEST!,1
"She is a very nice professor with a very clear explanation for each question. By reading the PPT she provided, and do all the practice, it is easy to pass. She also provided 3 grading policy and she will be based on your grade to see which policy was best for you. Also, she will curve the exam, so you don't need to worry about not passing her class",1
"As a person, he seems like a good guy. As a prof, I hated the way he structured the course. He doesn't post his notes, so you need to come to class. He also talks about a lot of studies from the lab and has images of graphs of the data.. which he does not post. I wish I had more space to explain how terrible this course was but avoid if you can!",0
"At first, the lectures are intimidating as you try to keep pace w/ Prof. Raphael's chatter.  Moreover, Prof. Rapheal asks questions that are easy to catch students off guard.  His attempts at humor are awkward but all in good fun.  Not exactly receptive to questions but a nice guy nonetheless. Exam was fair, if not easy and straightforward.",1
"Briggs is pretty monotone when he teaches, which can make it hard to focus in class.  You probably won't like him at the start of the class, but he grows on you over the term.  Surprisingly funny guy at times, and when he is doing review classes and not just lecturing he is much more concise and teaches the material well. ",0
"General Physics at Umass Lowell was hands down the worst educational experience of my life, the professors are inept and incompetent. The lectures don't match the recitation, which doesn't match the labs. The Umass Physics department is the biggest sorry excuse for higher education I've even had the misfortune to be a part of.  F's across the board",0
AVOID HER AT ALL COST!!!!!,0
"Excellent teacher! Made learning theoretical mathematics fun and interesting. Never puts long proofs on exams. All are theorems that he proved in class. I completely failed 2 exams, but still ended up with a B in the class because he saw that I knew the material after I aced the final.",1
Brilliant and fascinating and one of my favorite people ever. She is very very difficult but you WILL come out of the class a better writer!,1
"Parevez is a very bad professor. His classes consist of quizzes, and meaningless lectures. The days you don't take quizzes, he will run through problems out of the book and run through the problem as if you knew the material as well as he does. He does very minimal teaching. Grading at the end of the semester is on a curve, but by his discretion.",0
"VERY BORING! His lectures do not correspond with his tests. Puts questions on tests that weren't even covered in the chapters assigned. A lot of movies that will put you to sleep, only watches the beginning and expects you to know everything about the play. Relates everything to sex...(notice no pepper by his name) TRY TO GET A DIFFERENT PROFESSOR!",0
He is a rude person who uses words to hurt you if you don't understand the material making you feel dumb. when the course is very hard if you dont understand it with difficulty math involved. He slams his hands on tables and doesn't help you if you dont understand sometihng.,0
"Decent prof. Must buy lecture notebook from bookstore with all the notes or else its hard to follow along and you'll have to write your own notes (open book). Does lots of examples in class. Can sometimes go over concepts too quickly and can be dry but overall the course isn't too hard. Exams are all similar from previous years, easy to do well.",1
"Johnson is an educated English teacher. She knows what she is talking about but doesn't really give helpful feedback, it's more like she is just telling you what you did wrong and won't help you how to fix it. We wrote a lot essays; the research and argumentative ones wear the hardest. The presentation wasn't so hard to do however.",0
"I love this class, plus he's not one of those immensly boring psych teachers that everyone has.  I'm glad this is my major :)",1
This relates to the online version. I found Dr. Rhymer to be tough but fair - no late submissions and all projects/exams MUST be completed by 11:59 p.m. Friday night.  She provided excellent demonstrations of the most difficult equations and responded promptly to all questions (within a day or two.)  I'm a 4.0 student and I worked for the B+.,1
"Every Heldenbrand class is extremely predictable. Slide lectures daily with occasional humorous commentary. 10 point quizzes sprinkled throughout. Couple of Labs. Couple of Projects. Tests however, are HARD and WEIGHTY. They are literally worth 61.2% of the grade. If you figure out how to take his tests, you're golden. He's also a great guy.",1
The course seems easy but the way he teaches just sucks. Teaches about windows 7 for like 5 weeks. It could be in the course content but at least teach windows 10..? He deleted the materials we needed 2 days before the finals which is mean af. When you ask questions he would always get annoyed and be rude about it. I recommend choosing another prof,0
"Midterm was fair, but final is hard.",1
Young professor so he's really excited about teaching.  He tries to make it easy by having homework from connect online and the rest of your grade is tests.  Yu have to study for the test unless you know the material really well.  He's a very generous grader when it comes to essay questions but the tests are 90% made up of multiple choice.,1
"Dosn't make anything harder than it has to be, exams are fair",0
One of the rudest professors I have ever encountered.,0
Laura makes the very heavy and difficult course material interesting. She manages comments in the class well and provides a safe space for difficult topics. Love this prof! Hope to take more of her classes.,1
"The entire CGS major here at UCI is a big joke, especially since it's run by Frost who doesn't even have a good understanding of modern games honestly. You're stuck reading about articles from the 1980s and what makes video games ""art"". Why not just list this course under the Arts huh? At least you're combining two equally poor curriculum",0
She is a really nice person and a good proffesor. Teaches well and is very fair. You have to put in the effort to do well in this class.,1
"He is a great teacher, but you have to put ALOT of work into this class. His lectures are interesting but you have to write down EVERY little thing he says to make a good grade on tests. I can't stress this enough. He doesnt use PP or textbooks. Also, just read the 4 novels ok. He gives a ton of EC at the end. Take him, but be prepared to work.",1
"Gormley is awesome. He's funny too. Can be kind of pushy, but in a good way. He tries to push you in the right direction for the answer. If he questions a remark or response, don't take it personal, he's just trying to get you and the class to think deep. Great professor and very personable. Make a connection early and you'll do great!",1
"It honestly is an awesome class, and there's no one I'd rather have as a teacher. Yes, there are quite a few readings, but they are easy to keep up with if you space them out enough. Studying for quizzes and tests is more complex, but it is a positive experience learning how to.",1
"Do not take this class online. Extremely lecture heavy and the way he lays out his modules is confusing. Videos are also reused from like 2015. You have no contact with him at all during the semester, his TA is the one who hosts review sessions. Review sessions are also not helpful. May be better in person but online its very hard for a 101.",0
Very passionate about the subject and knows a lot. Uses  interesting stories to emphasize what we are learning. Very upbeat and easy to stay interested for a three hour class.,1
Mrs. Padgett is the worst teacher I have ever had. She is EXTREMELY scatterbrained therefore can never stay on topic. She claims to go by the syllabus but never does. She also picks favorites which get graded differently than the rest. Her grading varies by student or what mood she is in.  She is very unprofessional and inappropriate.,0
"Dr. Paquette's class is not hard at all, just time consuming. I learned a lot from him so far and plan to finish his class with a high A. All you have to do is complete the work he asks for, he has given plenty of time to get this done and I am taking his course during the summer. I look forward to History 122 in his class.",1
"I took this professor for 3 different classes- the other two were 1130 (Comparative Politics) and 3144 (Latin American Politics). He is a very supportive and understanding teacher, but he won't let you get away without doing your work. And though you talk about the readings, you will probably be ok to skim them for important points. Uses WebCT A++",1
He's the man... just dont try to contact him in any method except in person and expect any kind of timely response,1
"Dr. Gea is a very nice man; however, he is not a great physics teacher. The lectures are absolutely pointless and really only help you with attendance points. I taught myself everything in this course and relied heavily on past physics courses and the textbook.",0
"This professor is the best. His class is very interesting and he does a great job explaining confusing philosophical topics and moral issues. If you go to every class or at least most of them, you will get an A. His homework assignments are once a week and very reasonable. He's a lenient grader and the tests aren't bad either. Highly recommend!",1
He is truly amazing! You will be doing short quizzes weekly. They are helpful for th e midterm and final. Make sure to study those well and understand the labs as they help with the final exam. he really knows what he's doing and makes the materials fun and understandable. Take him if you can!!,1
"Dr. Morris has made a relatively boring, useless subject much easier.  She gives ample extra credit (up to 10pts/test), has flexible office hours, and obviously deeply cares about the progress of her students.  Anyone who slams her on being too hard doesn't belong in college.",1
"10/10 recommend I loved this class! He takes role every class but his class is enjoyable. 2 midterms, 5 homework assignments and a final. He gives study guides which are a list of terms from the section and you just need to memorize the definition. That is basically the test. No math or case study in this class. Only memorization. Super easy class!",1
Cant follow along during lectures at all. Stay home and read ur textbook,0
"She's Awful Awful don't take her if you register her class for now drop her today is last day to drop classes ,",0
Read the textbook thoroughly and you will do well on his exams. Also don't wait last minute to start your projects do small amounts over the coarse of the semester.,1
She was very helpful in lab. She would go over every section of the lab before you start. She would put any necessary formulas or examples on the board. She graded very generously. She was extremely helpful and always willing to help everyone with anything. She was very nice and friendly too. You always has plenty of time to complete lab in class.,1
"Dr.Ropp really knows his stuff.  He is really aproachable and wants to help students  He jokes around and makes learning fun. Great proffesor, Challenging class.",1
"Had to drop this class after a few weeks. She gives tons of homework for little credit. Homework is worth 5 points only and thats only if she collects it. She does some mistakes on exams like marking an answer wrong when its correct so you have to look out for that. Whole grade is based on tests and final, does not count homework or attendance.",0
This instructor is the worst instructor I have ever had. She doesnt have the quality that teacher supposed to have. She shouldn't be teaching at all until she goes back to school to educate herself on how to be a professor.,0
"He is a good teacher, however his midterm and final are very difficult. But he is always willing to help you",1
Best prof I have ever had. It's a tough class though. One tip is to ask lots of questions. She knows her stuff and gives really clear explanations.,1
"Pretty average. Talks slow, repeats the same thing in different ways, kinda boring. Labs are mandatory but don't always help you - like watching movies. The tests aren't necessarily hard but it's different than the notes. He is understanding if you miss an exam but keep up and go to class - participation grading happens a lot.",1
"Thad is great! I took him this Summer for Physiology,and he made it awesome. He doesn't waste your time with things you don't need, and is VERY clear about what he expects you to know. It's a hard class, but Thad gives you every opportunity to do well. He's got a good sense of humor, and really knows his stuff. I would highly recommend taking him!",1
I have had Professor Bemisdarfer twice now. Once in person and recently online. He is a wonderful person in person and great online. If you pay attention and listen to instructions you will pass with no trouble. He gives good feedback and will try his best to help you succeed. I would DEFINITELY recommend taking his class. :),1
very very tough grader. I made one little error on a ten point essay question on a test and she marked the whole question wrong. Did that with everyones test all or nothing grader. Tests were made up from quiz questions but she changes the words around most students I talked to got Ds on the tests.,0
"he's a nice guy, work oriented. i'm just a fanatic of the field. i just wish he would take interest in all aspects of teaching both inside and outside the cassroom. i've cried i've laughed and i'm still breathing for the moment. take care sir. opportunity knocks at the door, but my knocking seems futile. this sample has too many associated errors.",0
"Prof. Auxter spends the first half of class summarizing the readings, and the second half talking about his interpretation of them, especially how they relate to his ideals. While it's engaging in the beginning, I don't feel like I actually learned much. The three papers were easy, but I wish that the class had centered around discussion.",0
Her elegance and poise is only matched by her classy style. She's really nice and well organized. Hands down the fastest marker i've had. she's tough and doesn't tolerate nonsense but if you're on the ball and know your stuff she is a joy to have as a teacher.,1
"Frank really know his material & is genuinely intelligent but the way he teaches this class & the way his tests are set up, are ridiculous. The tests arent based off anything that he puts into his power points. There are lots of papers & it's almost as if he refuses to give out good grades for them. This class was very frustrating to say the least",0
Mark was arrogant and rude. He got angry at a student the first day of lab because she forgot a protractor. Our midterms were handed back on my birthday (sorry I wasn't in class) and he asked me to review the attendance policy and pick it up from his office. He needs to get off of his high horse and tune into the real world. ,0
dont be fooled by Elementary Spanish this class is tough and if you are not comfortable with the language do take it. im fluent in Spanish and there were some questions that I struggled to answer. the professor seems nice but completely disappeared throughout the 10 week course. she DOES NOT RESPOND TO EMAIL. avoid at all cost. no support at all,0
"very interested in the courses he teaches, helpful when asked",1
Ask you put comments on every piece of you code and take all points of if you didn't. I got every thing correct on my final but lost 40 point all due to her stupid putting comments rule,0
I really enjoyed this course and I recommend Professor Schmitz's class to everyone!,1
"Found Dan to be a pretty straight forward guy. Very clear. He was pretty generous marking papers. A good number of people did poorly on exams, however other found it quite simple. Overall i believe it was taught really well. Learned a lot.",1
"I love Affonso, but his teaching style is something that structure oriented students should avoid. He truly does care about each of his students and wants us all to succeed, but he is very disorganized when it comes to actually collecting assignments. You will be able to get an A as long as you actually participate in the class and around campus.",1
He is sweet and very given. He really cares about students and the community. There are amazing speakers.,1
"DO NOT TAKE ONLINE. She never replies to emails and her grading criteria is very unclear. Failed most of my class on a project that was honestly not hard just because. The midterm and final are the only tests and both worth 20% of your grade, each only have 20 questions. Worst math teacher I've had at Blinn, and that's saying something.",0
"He was by far my favorite professor this semester. We learned so much about media, including South Park! He was so interesting and he's adorable. Even as an honors class it was very clear, but still challenging. I would absolutely take another class with him.",1
"He is terrible at explaining concepts and he does not prepare for his tests which are extremely difficult. He is available for office hours, but he lets all students into the room so that it is really hard to get your question across.",0
"Professor Willmore is fine at teaching, but the amount of assignments we have online (during Covid-19) is ridiculous. She cares more about the specificities than if youre actually learning the material. You can definitely tell she cares, but I took her class in an extremely difficult time of my life and she was less than understanding. Id skip.",0
Okay so Wilson is really a nice guy and cares about what he's teaching but he's not clear with grades and uses a curve so broken that 93s and 94s become B pluses. He's also very bad about responding to emails and the lectures are incredibly boring and dry. Also his quizzes are beyond beyond beyond arbitrary and unless you memorize readings no luck.,0
Nordling is a very hard professor. His tests are unpassable. He only gives three grades if you mess up one your done. He doesn't tell students what to study or even give hints he just says study the entire first six weeks. If at all possible do not take him.,0
"He knows the subject well, but his attitude wasn't great... like he couldn't be bothered, either to update pre-taped recordings where you can't see the writing on the most important first six chapters, or go back himself, listen to his own lectures and see if still they actually match what he says will definitely be on tests (at least 50% didn't).",0
"I gave this professor such a low rating because she just doesn't care about her students. I only had her for a lab, and she graded my labs wrong (which she openly acknowledged), took forever to give back labs, and was never available after class to answer questions. I can't begin to imagine what I would do if I had her for a lecture.",0
"For a class that was as tough(for me) as calc was, Dersch was able to get the material across and was excellent when it came to teaching the concepts and why certain tasks can be done. Along side with that, he was able to make the classroom feel like a comfortable space and provided nice comic relief during lectures.",1
This class was difficult and easy at the same time. Only tests are midterms and final exams. You are graded off of 3 essays which he grades very difficult on. Tests and midterms are all writing definitions and essay questions. Every other day are just lectures the whole class period.,1
"Dr. Ahmad is a chaotic professor. She didn't know what she wanted us to get out of the class, and it was very obvious. Every class time we talked in groups about the readings. She made us give her our phone numbers and set up meetings with us very late in the evening. During our final class, we spent two hours watching music videos.",0
Terrible at explaining the material. You come to class and all he does is work through examples. If you ask a question -- be prepared to look like an idiot. His tests are more difficult and somewhat different than what's on the homework he assigns.,0
I was so excited to take this class and ended being very unhappy & disappointed. He doesn't know much about pop culture & turns everything into a discussion on race. Tests are 100% written & asks questions that don't even make sense. If you email him he responds with vague answers that leave you more confused. Changes assignment criteria at the min,0
"Don't buy the really expensive textbook- most if not all of the short stories can be found online for free. Honestly, a Wikipedia summary is enough to past the quizzes.",0
"Professor Lane is unorganized, horrible at grading, vague about assignments, inconsistent with due dates and instructions, unqualified to teach, talks to much about himself, and will only give you an A if you kiss his arse. Do NOT take this Prof. I could teach any of his classes right now, because he doesn't actually present any knowledge.",0
I enjoyed this class very much! I am going to take ENG 112 next semester. If you need to take ENG 111 BLANKENSHIP IS A MUST. Helps students when asked questions. Provides great feedback on essays. Midterm is a research paper that you do in two class periods and is there to assist. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED (:,1
"As an online teacher, he's not great. Lectures have been incredibly boring - I've been using the book and homework to teach myself. The tests were open-notes, but I didn't have enough time to finish. I feel like I understand the concepts well, but it doesn't translate to the exams.",0
She should be teaching an introductory class. Her lectures are quite dry. She reads straight from the powerpoint. A lot of modules are online. Majority of the projects are group assignements when they don't need to be. Assignments are graded by a TA that we have never met. This class could easily be an online 8 week course. Quizes might get you.,0
"Very hard to follow lectures, quiet - kind of hard to hear her in a class of 120. She always seems anxious when teaching the class. Also, she is vague about what will be on the midterm and totally misled my class, bringing the class average wayyyyy down. Not recommended.",0
Doug is awesome! He is so nice and you can tell he really cares about his students and Sociology. Although my class was remote delivery with him I knew that if I ever needed anything he would be understanding. I was I could've had his class in person 10/10 recommend.,1
"He knows a lot about his subject and has interesting lectures. Old way of teaching, he lacks pedagogy. I got lost in a sea of information. The process of how to write an essay was confusing. If you are a visual learner like me you will be lost. There are no charts, drawings, pictures, audio or movements to support learning. Just disorganized text.",1
Gross didn't teach anything in class. We had to attend class 4 time per week so she could just talk about nothing and we would have to learn it on our own. She wouldn't even review in class. She also was never in her office so I could never ask her a ques,0
"Barb is wonderful, even if this class is a little too in depth for an intro class.  You really have to be interested in the information to pay attention to lectures but she always has the slide shows up before hand.  As long as you study exactly what is on the review sheet and do the discussions/essays you'll do fine",1
"I heard a load of great things about him but, taking his class as an arts requirement was NOT worth it. Like yeah it's a level 300 class but not all of us in the class is a music major, even a music minor. Great guy though but don't take his 325 if you want that arts requirement. Take MTC 110 instead.",1
"He has clicker questions every day so his attendance is mandatory and you also get points for showing up to class. Study for those quizzes, show up to class and for sure do the extra credits cause all these will help you to boost your grade up by a letter. His lectures however are useless and reading the book and powerpoints will help you for tests",0
"Very nice man, if you attend all classes, pay attention, & take notes then he's really nice to you & will help if you go to his office. However he's terrible at explaining things clearly, homeworks are hard to do & are 30% of your final grade, so getting A's in your tests is nothing if you make less than perfect 100s on your hws -_- Easy tests thou",0
Melissa Benfield is a great teacher!  She is very nice and warm and cares about here students and wants you to do well.  She will answer questions and she is very clear.  If you do the work and follow the instructions you will do well.  I would take her again if I had the chance.,1
"As an undergraduate, I was extremely disappointed with Merrimack's Education program and the quality of teachers the college offered. Despite my disappointment, I gave it a second chance for grad school. I am so glad I did. I've had Joanne for two classes. She is without a doubt the best professor in the School of Education. Intelligent and caring.",1
"Meadows was an awful professor. To the point where I didn't even go to class and tried teaching myself the material. The material itself is really easy, it is the way she presents it and grades that got a student who gets basically all A's and B's a D in her class. Good luck asking questions too, because she comes off rude and disrespectful, too.",0
LOVED Dr. Bush!!!  She was my advisor.  I catch up with her every year at alumni events!,1
amazing professor. his lectures don't put you to sleep and he makes the class fun.  just show up to class and do your 3-2-1s. you have to do an incredibly easy midterm and a short presentation at the end of the semester. easy A. also don't bother getting a textbook.  ,1
"He would spend a large amount of time having us watch irrelevant movies or talking about topics not directly related to US History. He would also have us read from the book but ignore the material and test us on absurd topics, e.g. How are Trump and Hitler related (we didn't even cover the rise of Hitler or his policies pre-WWII).",0
Never take this course with him.,0
"Lots of people like him because he is funny, but frankly I think he is just a lazy drunk, didn't grade any hw till the very end, never saw the correct answers so know I got things wrong, no way to know why or how to fix.",0
Although the subject matter of the classes are intersting the manner by which it is taught is exteremly lackluster. This woman is also not very approachable.,0
She is a very nice lady. Her lecture can be a bit boring sometimes (make sure to participate once in a while) but she definitely cares about her students and the class isn't too hard.,1
"She gives ALOT of homework ( which i find helpful for studying ) but what I dont find helpful is the fact that she literally re-reads everything you did for homework right back to you during class, theres no new information being taught to me. She also isn't very clear w instructions for homework and grades ( too ) harshly in my opinion.",0
"Dr. Lalonde is a super caring and insightful professor. His lectures can be a little dry and boring but his tests are extremely fair. If you read the textbook and study the lecture notes you will do well. Moreover, he tries to guide his students towards the material that he will test. Overall, if you try and will do well in his class.",1
"Sometimes contradicted her text, but overall knows her stuff very well and really tries to help you.  Puts people on the spot but only because she wants to help.  Very funny, and I learned a lot from her. Songs are so much fun!",1
"cannot speak english, cannot communicate effectively, not very helpful at all",0
"Dr. Conner is excellent. However, if you are looking for intellectual history, a different prof might be advisable. He is very good with events and the narrative of history, but for American Heritage, I was a little let down by the lack of evaluation of the success or failure of the American experiment.",1
He is an awesome teacher! Very caring and personable. Would recommend!,1
"Lectures often seem pointless, but he really tries to interest students. The ebook is a MUST, take notes from the text and his lecture summaries and do all the exercises without looking at the solutions until after you're done, and you're basically guaranteed an A. Usually happy to answer questions at his office, but his answers can be confusing.",1
Very hard professor. You are better off learning from someone else. Avoid at all costs. ,0
Hes strange but okay.,1
"His lecture made me curious and enjoyable. He explained the theory as easily as he can, it helps students to understand. His lab and exam are not too tough, which makes less pressure. Less assignment, no quiz. But he emphasizes attendance. No attendance, no mark for the lab.",1
"Very nice and knowledgeable, but she gives a staggering amount of work & is a very tough grader.  She believes that in order to get an A, you must go above & beyond what is required of the assignment.  She is very responsive via email for online classes & gives good feedback, but the assignments are often unclear. Be ready for a lot of work.",1
Awesome prof!Really enjoyed the course.,1
"Lethbridge is okay at what he does. He bases the class on his own book, so it's generally very easy to get an A+, much less pass. He is rather annoying, but at least he's not boring. He goes on interesting rants and when he's wrong about something his reactions are downright hilarious; he gets really flustered. Easy course -- take it for that.",1
"I think the geology department needs to find a replacement teacher. Linda does not teach or even provide the material needed for the labs, and then insults students as if theyre dumb when they question how theyre supposed to complete the labs. You have to google the answers or ask the handful or geology students. She does not want to work.",0
"Well. I am in the class now and I am here to say, avoid him. Social problems is a very interesting class but not the way he does it. Hes a stickler for you being in the class but the lectures dont help with any exam. The questions on the exams are hard and even with the reading, hell ask a question but make it so your work doesnt matter.",0
i'll wait till i see my grade...then i shall comment. lol. nooo am kidding. seriously...he is a cool guy...very lax and seriously you learn alot of interesting things. Makes you think too. I loved the class. the whole 6 to 9 thing was a bit much though. But fun nontheless.,1
Rick is a great professor but definitely makes you work for your grade. Participation is crucial to passing his class. His lectures are very helpful so pay attention!,1
"IF YOUR LIFE DOES NOT DEPEND ON YOU TAKING THIS CLASS, DO NOT TAKE IT! TA sections more worthwhile, but still extremely difficult for non-music majors and NOT WORTH the aggrevation :( HATED THIS CLASS",0
"He's the best prof at Blinn. He's extremely experienced, very intelligent, and very hilarious and kind. He made me love the topic and I learned things that will stick with me for a long time. Cares about animals, cares about his students. I can't say enough kind words about him. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",1
"Avoid this professor at all costs! If you want to do self-studying the entire sem, he prolly is for you, but if you actually wanna learn from this class inside a lecture hall, nah this aint it.",0
"Dr. Mathews is a nice guy but I hated his class. He never gave A's on anything, even though there were many times when I believed I should have gotten an A. He assigns reading to you, and then reads it to you in class. Then waits for someone to say something. Then keeps reading. Waste of time.",0
"Terrible. Changed everything last minute, didn't grade a single thing, expected students to do more than what was initially stated. Very unorganized.",0
"His class is great.  He's very relaxed and converstional with his lectures.  His exams and assignments are fair.  He's very easy going and makes the class pretty fun.  I think he also teaches at NVCC-Alexandria and GMU.  Look for him, he's a winner.",1
Throughout this class I questioned if Dr Lee really knows what he is talking about? Maybe things are lost in translation but content he is teach is just plain wrong.,0
"The work load for this class is very heavy including forum posts, quizzes, listening quizzes, and tests for it to be an elective class. Play close attention to due dates. He is a fair grader. If you stay on top of your assignments and due dates, you will be fine. He is going to make you work for an A!",0
"PMATH 351 is tough and his version is harder than the others', and the workload is very high now that things are online. However, other than workload and difficulty, there should be no complaints at all. Generous bonuses, comprehensive lecture notes, videos, and solutions, helpful Piazza hints. Learned so much from this course.",1
"Her lectures can be pretty vague - often they are based around literary-philosophical concepts such as 'form' and 'nature' that are not very well-explained. As a result, it can sometimes feel like she is talking in great detail about something that nobody (even the TA's) have a grasp on.",0
"In adjusting to the online format, Prof Wiebe has continued to go with 1h 20 min lectures, which he uses to go off on side tangents frequently. Be prepared to work hard in his class, as most phil 140 classes I've heard to be among the easier side of classes, but unfortunately not this one.",0
"Very interesting professor.. He isnt the type of professor that makes sure you understand what you learned in class. Sometimes I felt as if his lectures go in one ear and out of the other. Your grade throughout the year is based on your ""portfolio"" which he skims through the hw you've completed and the corrections to the test that you WILL fail lol",1
"Butowsky is so dry and boring when he lectures.  If you don't read the books he assigns then you won't get higher than a C on his tests.  He doesn't really go over them, and doesn't teach all of the material he's going to test on.  He has literally two grades for the entire course, so be careful.",1
His lectures just confuse you more than anything. A lot of people (including me) only attend recitation and grades have improved since then. He rambles about unimportant details and is very dry. Hopefully you have a good TA to make up for it,0
"Her projects were really fun and interesting.  she is hard on crafstmanship.  she is really nice and friendly.  tough to understand at times.  contradictory in critiques sometimes.  she grades tough, almost impossible to get an A.  it's possible but very difficult.",0
He's an amazing professor. He is like when you can recall an entire textbook and its concepts because it was taught so clearly. The professor is like that. He explains the course curriculum real clearly.,1
He was a very good writing teacher since he has been at it for a longggg time. His level of interaction was low but that made the writing pace up to the writer which was really nice.,1
Great teacher and even better guy! I took his class and learned a lot!,1
"If I could give him a 0, I would. Worst prof I have ever had to date.",0
Worst Professor I have had at GVSU. His tests always had errors and was not interested in hearing how you interpreted a question. His tests are very vague and extremely unclear so misinterpretation can cause a wrong answers. I am a strong student and struggled to receive an C in this course. I would warn all pre-nursing majors not to take him!,0
"Had for Chem Lab. Learned more in his lab than I did from a different professor for lecture. Very relaxed, makes everything easier to understand. Don't Hesitate to take him for lab. I can only imagine how great it would have been to have him for lecture",1
This is probably one of the most challenging Classes I have taken. Proffessor Robertson expects a lot out of her students. You have one big research paper throughout the whole semester and a final group project. Personally i feel like a lot of her assignments were rushed and required a lot of crunch time . But i will say I learned a lot.,0
"It worths taking the class if you're interested in digital circuits or embedded systems. Nice person, HOWEVER, he is extremely unorganized and NOT prepared for many topics. The materials are not that hard, I strongly recommend study yourselves if you cannot get used to his lectures (I CAN'T, and he makes me HATE the related fields).",0
"A TON of homework. One Chapter may have up to 10 homework packets, which should be semi-completed by the time he gives lecture, (which he rarely does.)  Study guides do not match his exams. Grading is difficult to understand. Every other word from his mouth is ""I wont explain it, you guys are at a 209 level. "" Very rude",0
Dr. V is very knowledgeable. VERY knowledgeable. However it seems her busy schedule takes precedence to the class. This class was a 6-9 and she showed up late almost every time. She gives you random assignments and acts as if they were super clear and concise. That is never the case. She really means well but she misses the mark.    ,0
The tutorials were a mess--not very helpful at all. She tried to break down the material but was disorganised for the most part.,1
"I lost all respect for him towards the end of the semester when he kept showing us pictures of the effects of war. They were tasteless and vulgar and lowered his professionalism as a teacher. Also, he made a paper due a couple days after our final which is not ethical. I spoke to other professors & they all encouraged me to talk to the dean.",0
Had this teacher for 2 online classes. Introduction to economics and principles of microeconomics. Watch videos on the connect site and you should get an A.,1
"He laid out the course in a very confusing way so I never knew how to study for this. When asking for help he never once responded back to various emails (shocking as being online is sort of his job). If this is your first online course DO NOT TAKE HIM, better to do in class. Midterms were nothing like what we learned or what he said they would be.",0
"One of my favorite profs ever. While we are all online, he does his best to engage students and make sure we are understanding the material. Super important you read the assigned readings. Even though they're long and dense, makes everything easier (plus he doesn't cover some content in the book) TIP: form a study group w peers",1
"This professor is overrated.  I don't know how his clarity is so high.  He's hard to understand and doesn't explain enough.  Not terrible, but expects you to know too much.",0
Uses slides and goes fast. Hockey stick for a pointer.,1
"She's tough, rude, and doesn't know how to use a quiet voice. If you did something wrong, the whole class about to know what you did. She also scolds you like you're in elementary school. Get ready to read, and get harsh criticism. She also doesn't always tell you everything that you need to know, or only tells you once. Don't take class with her.",0
"He's really funny and gives good feedback.  I enjoy his class and his papers are not terribly long and intense.  He loves to tell you about how liberal he is, but what do you expect from a lit professor? Take his class! He's a good time.",1
"Solid prof, discussion based class so few lectures. My only issue with her is she doesn't use Canvas so it's hard to keep track of things. She springs a lot of random assignments on you but their always small. Requires you to go to events outside of class a few times. Group projects but their easy if you work with solid people. She is nice and fun.",1
"Okay, so his class is VERY easy.  BUT, he's got too strong an agenda. I honestly remember nothing but him talking about how terrible we've been to natives. I've been to all the classes, and that's honestly all I remember. We learned nothing the syllabus said we would. I feel like I wasted an entire semester for what could have been one seminar.",0
"Caring defines her best. The first professor I took time out of my day to leave a positive review about. Orgo Lab was really intimidating, but Sara is definitely one of the few instructors ""on the student's side."" She's very sweet, patient, and helpful. The work load is average for chem, but she's there to help at all times.",1
"He does the bare minimum to teach, breezes through material & does not like to explain concepts. Also, we used a book that was mainly online & this was not communicated well. I did not know how to use the book until 3 weeks into the semester. Do not take if you have not had a math course in a while.",0
"To my fellow student who wrote the false comment below: I am in the same class, attendance is optional, there is a textbook, which you my fellow student never used. Instead of making false claims and blaming others, why did you not show up to class, study hard, and seek help when needed? The final was easy multiple choice, online, and open-book.",1
Didn't have a great experience with Prof Watts. He grades pretty tough as I would try my best but never could get anything over a B. The compositions and oral exams were graded in a way that you cannot make mistakes if you want an A. Nothing we did furthered my learning in the class. Waits months to put grades into BB & isn't good at emails.,0
"One of my favorite professors! You can tell he's definitely passionate about what he teaches, and he always has the best ways of explaining the significance of the lecture topic.   Use his notes, along with 2nd language text and practice alot!  NOTE: THE FINAL IS ALWAYS HARD AND WILL MAKE YOU CRY.... But ""That's the nature of the beast!""",1
Dr. Taylor-Perry is a wonderful chemistry professor and I would highly recommend her for Chemistry 111. She gives a lot of pop quizzes but they aren't usually too difficult and you can work with a partner. She makes chemistry lectures enjoyable and she knows how to capture the attention of her students. Ask for help and she is willing to help you.,1
"The work is appropriate for the type of class. Ketterer may look like a hardass, but he's a nice guy if you crack the shell.",1
His class on arab-israeli politics is transparently biased.  He actually did try to argue that Hamas was a moderate group.  His assignments are intentionally vague and subjective so that he can give any grade he wants.  He subverts students' opinions.,0
Be prepared to stress but good thing is that open book besides on midterm and final.,0
"I could not stand this class. I found it to be annoying since I signed up for an in-person class and got a hybrid class. The lectures were boring, people would sign in and leave. It was frustrating because her class was all based on MindTap. I would not recommend anyone to take her just because her class is a waste of time and money.",0
"He is a horrible teacher, does not show time or devotion to his students. Seems less versed on his subject matter to those who actually understand programming in general.",0
Tom - was a huge inspiration even 11 years past graduation I talk about him a lot.,1
"One of the best! He's always there for you, and his classes are always the highlight of your day.",1
Beware. Just dont take her unless you have to. Trust me!,0
"I got fooled by all the glowing comments. This teacher rewards the ones who does not work by extending deadlines more than once, and we who got bags under our eyes, giving everything before it was due, got nothing. Waits until you lost all of your sleep to anounce extensions. Very harsh grader. Not an iota of extra credit. Regret taking her.",0
"Lectures were kind of monotonous, so it was hard to pay attention. He posts slides online. 1 midterm exam, questions are easy if you even just review lectures. Final was a paper, which was time-consuming but not too difficult. Had a required field trip to a Sikh temple (w a reflection paper on it), which was an incredible learning experience",1
"Dr. Brown is hilarious, so listening to his lectures was never a challenge. The class was extremely easy, although he was a very slow grader and our grades were a bit unclear. If you ask for individual help, he's very nice and takes the extra time out to speak with students one on one. I could tell he was passionate about what he was teaching.",1
"Literally the worst professor I ever had. Quizzes were very hard, and you can't really study for them. Tried my best, and still failed. Will NEVER take again. Very specific o quizzes and the final paper.",0
Ok she is a tough teacher but unless you are one of her favorites and she does have favorites you will not get any positive feedback from her. She will knit pick you to the point that you can get a note out of you. She'll make you so mad that you'll want to punch her. She can be extremely disrepctful to you infront of everyone!Take someone else.,0
"She was super frustrating. Algonquin has a college that teachers are supposed to respond to emails within 48 hours, and she would reply a week later, most often she didn't bother to reply at all. Very hard to get any real help. Will take the course again with a different prof.",0
"I was fortunate to have Prof. Keaney for ENG 325. She prepared us extremely well for future classes. She expects hard work (don't be absent, and expect frequent quizzes), but you get your money's worth in this course. In one-on-one meetings, she is warm and engaging and will help you improve.",1
The grading she implemented for a made up summer class pretty much ruined my freshmen year GPA.,0
Dr. Kahn is a nice professor who does not know how to direct a classroom. She tends to let people get the class off topic and it usually results in a tangent which takes up most of the class time. She teaches at a high school level and tests at a grad level. She also takes around 2-4 weeks to grade tests. If you can take another professor do so.,0
"She's way too enthusiastic for it to feel genuine. Students do improve under her, but not as much as they probably would under another teacher. This class has everyone from freshman to senior in it, so you would expect differing levels of difficulty for each student, but she really doesn't push anyone past a freshman level.",1
"Easiest professor thus far, and i learned a lot.  The other kids in my class were 3/4 retarted though. If you are breathing and have a pulse over 10 beats/minute, and spend only one hour before each test to study...YOU WILL GET AN A.  PERIOD.  Also, nice guy, loved talking to him.  Grades super fair and super easy.  take him!",1
"Great teacher, be prepared to study. She explains things very well but you will have to devote a great deal of time to studying. Her class prepared me very well for other biology classes.",1
"Geveci is really knowledgeable when it comes to math, he definitely knows his stuff. The problem with this is he goes through everything very quickly and with very little explanation of the basic concepts-- you need to be ready to teach yourself because of this, although his (free) book is pretty decent, and he gives you the solutions.",0
"IDK what everyone is talking about, I took Zann before him (same class)& Zann didn't care at all & I ended up failing. Jingpeng did livestreams so we could ask questions & actually taught. It was great! He stutters but I watched the streams afterword at 1.5& had no problem. He helped me out with projects t me turn some in late Give him a chance!",1
"Should've dropped her class when I had the chance. She treats her students like elementary children. First day she started off the class threatening grade drops for walking in over 3 mins late, bathroom breaks (permission required.) Besides her attitude and the fact that her voice made me cringe, it's an alright class..",0
"Lectures are very poorly produced, concepts discussed don't match up with homework content, and tests require every single step to be properly documented",0
"I would not recommend this instructor. She was very upset with the students, because she had to teach in a computer class, so she took it out on her students. Doesn't even go step by step with porblems. WAS ON HER PHONE MOST OF THE TIME AND GOT COCKY IF YOU ASKED FOR HELP.",0
Just don't. If you don't need this class for credit don't bother taking it with him.,0
Profe is super nice and hilarious. She talks mostly in a mixture of Spanish and English but her accent is easy to understand. Lots of reading for the class and her tests are very challenging. Need to study a lot to do well. She teaches the language really well and I really feel like my Spanish improved a lot. Take her if you want to learn.,1
"Very caring, amazing person. Great overall teacher.",1
"Idk who gave him a 5.0 and said he's charismatic bc my class experienced the opposite. He would pre-record lectures and play them during class, but leave his computer so no one could ask questions. He was rude, condescending, and dismissive toward students. Grading/expectations were unclear and lectures were unorganized. Do not recommend",0
"She is extremely nice and approachable. She is also hilarious. Definitely a great prof, however the course content was quite dull.",1
"She really knows what she is talking about. You really have to show up for class, but she makes the material interesting and engaging. I truly enjoyed this class.",1
"He's a very interesting person and he is very knowledgable.  However, his lessons seem kind of random and he gets off topic easily.  Also, he is not always clear in what he expects from assignments.  Lastly, the final paper is 12-15 pages.",1
"Serious blowhard, heard this class my be cancelled due to such terrible student reviews. Incomprehensible and frustrating if you're actually interested.",0
"Ooh-la-la.  WHAT A HOTTY.  GREAT CLASS, GREAT PROF.  AND THOSE EYES....",1
"great professor, class is interesting and if you dont do well on his exams but go see him about it...he will find away to help you",1
She is the most hate-inspired woman I have ever dealt with and that is not an exaggeration by any means.  I absolutely despise this woman and cannot understand how she's still got a job.,0
The guy is the prof from Back To The Future (doc). Very entertaining but will ruin you on your midterm if you make the most minute mistakes. Not very pleasant when you go to him for help.,1
"I made a huge mistake taking Prf. Smith. She is nasty, sarcastic, doesn't give good feedback on papers, and is very unorganized. I should've stuck with my professor from last semester. Prf. Smith runs her class in an ""my way or no way"" kind of fashion. Do not take her, ever.",0
"Lectures deal only with proofs and are boring. Homework is extra credit. McNulty is great at explaining problems if you go to office hours. For exams, just memorize the example problems and go to the review session. Careless errors will kill you in this class. You receive many attempts to Master a problem so poor performance early on is okay.",1
Kim is hilarious. She really has a passion for art history and knows every little story about every work of art by heart. Does her best to help students.,1
"Professor Jenepher is my favourite prof by far. She makes sure everyone understands the material before moving on (Good communication skills, duh). For us, there was an online quiz due every week before class starts which I think is so helpful in preparing yourself before the lecture. Overall, she's just an amazing person. 10/10 would recommend",1
"Do not take. His lectures don't make any sense. He only goes through basic algebra, doesn't explain how he got his answers on the new content. If you have to take him, make sure to go to another professors lecture to understand what is happening in the class and actually pass.",0
"Great professor, makes the content interesting! It's hard to organize a class with over 3000 students but he did a great job!",1
"Very interesting and informative instructor. Very clear and reiterates all the important points. She lays everything out exactly how she expects it in terms of assignments.  Excellent prof, I'd take any and all classes she offered.",1
"She did not giv clear instructions, and she graded whether she like you or not. In the syllabus she stated that it did not matter how you did grade wise on your papers and test it was all up to here",0
Doc can be described as a mad scientist. His honors CHEM 111 and 112 classes are NOT like a regular class. You cover the regular material in the first couple weeks and then he talks about what he wants. It is very interesting. You learn a lot and you are forced to develop good study habits. It isn't an easy class even if you've had chem before.,1
"Bobby is a great professor. He has an odd sense of humor that makes things entertaining, but he also presents the material in a way where it clicks with you. If you've struggled with math I would definitely recommend him.",1
She does not answer emails. She did not grade any assignments until the last few days of class. She is very opinionative but nice. I would choose a different professor if you actually want to learn about the subject. She does give good feedback for improvement but she is very unorganized and does not clearly specify what to do when she gives work.,0
His handwriting is sometimes hard to read and his lectures aren't very engaging. He is very nice and always accessible and willing to help. Wants his students to succeed and does reviews for all tests. Notes are posted online but if you're not great I recommend you to go to class. Textbook is not needed. 4 tests only but does extra credit.,1
"Falcon is one of a kind I would say. His class is hard and requires a lot of reading but I think being able to hear him lecture is worth it. He presents a lot of different perspectives and isnt afraid to get controversial. Im glad I stumbled across his class and didnt drop it, he really has impacted my perspective of the world",1
This class is really easy to pass. Just show up and you will get an A. Our last test in his class we watched the Tiger's opening game.,1
"DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PROFESSOR. Does not post all lecture slides, tests are very tough (his questions on exams are not to be found in your notes), if you have a second option go for the second option. Not the greatest prof.",0
"I had never taken calc before and damn I needed help. I advise getting a tutor because in class you cannot pay attention due to the monotonous teaching along with the difficulty. He means well but it is hard to learn from him. Also, do go to him and show that you want to do well he may bump up your grade if you do well on the final.",0
It's your typical useless credit course. He is  guy who quizzes on reading retention (useless) and his paper is unnecessarily difficult - minimum 6 pages and we can't use the Internet (WHO DOES THAT). He is a little pretentious and thinks he is above all else when his class is just a course people take as a required course. Lectures are good tho,0
"Professor MacArthur is a double edged sword. If you are a non-English major looking for an easy English class, he is your man. Just prepared to be bored to death. Bring work from other classes to do. However, if you are a serious English major, he is a waste of your money. You will learn nothing because he is busy rambling about irrelevant topics.",0
"Professor Gaston is Unlike any other professor, he is extremely wise! I think every person should take at least one of his courses. He is a tough professor but because he cares, very tough class definitely a challenge, but a challenge worth taking. One class of his will give you a deeper insight to life! Be ready to be mindblown!",1
"Really good class but was some of the hardest grading Ive ever experienced. While I managed to maintain an A, I spent more time on this class every week than any other. The class averages were generally Cs or lower. Dont take unless you have very strong English skills and lots of time to devote to homework.",1
"Don't ever take pictures or be on your phone in his class, or he'll yell at you and kick you out! His last two tests were also stuff that was never seen before, as almost the whole class got zeroes in the writing part, thus making a bird course much harder than it should be.",0
"Started off fine with lectures followed by a weekly lab assignment. Then about 3/4 into the semester, we jumped from writing simple linux scripts to installing a linux server on a VM, installing a new kernel, editing and recompiling the kernel with VERY little instruction. Class structure was rather sloppy in my opinion.",1
"Good luck with Baldi. You're gonna cry. You're gonna fail. You don't know what's going on. You won't finish the homework. Satan just sent this guy directly from the deepest hell. He also looks like Michio Kaku, which is very intimidating. The first and second week was easy, so don't be overconfident. Starting the 3rd week, welcome to hell.",0
"hard... im not a big fan of people who intimidate me... probably because not many can get away with it... but he's genuinely intimidating.. and not necessarily in a bad way... but lets be honest, i never did my reading, i listend in class... most of the time, and i fell behind on my worksheets = D+",0
"The best english teacher ever. Read everything he assigns because there will be quiz. The content of the class is boring but he makes it so interesting. Take good notes, read, participate!",1
LOVE pellathy. he is so smart and just an all around nice guy. very helpful and funny.,1
"I couldnt get a worst introduction into NYU, like I still think im bad at math because of this class. like actually ruined my GPA, spent so much time trying to figure out the notes for this class I did bad on other classes too. She seems like a smart person but she just CAN NOT teach. If any freshman see this, please do yourself a favor and SWITCH!",0
Gives excessive amount of assignments. His teaching is ok but his grading is rediculous.,0
"Awful grader, doesnt give feedback to help your grade.",0
"Kirtland is my favorite math teacher by far. He is funny, assigns one piece of homework per week and is available very often for extra help. Calculus is not an easy class, it is on YOU to do the work. His lectures are informative and if you put in the work outside of class, you will have no issue. He also lets students shoot the chalk into th trash",1
"The best professor I've had in the ECE department thus far. Excellent lectures, and if you put effort into this class, it will be rewarded. Programming assignments are somewhat challenging but a fair testing of our knowledge. Would love to have him for another class in the future.",1
"This man loves to hear his own voice. He will find any reason to stroke his own ego. If there is a moment where he is in thw wrong, that is completly preposterous to him and will find someone or something else to blam such as the book. Lastly, all of his material is not from his own knowlege but from a book that was writen 10 years ago!!!!!!!!!!",0
He was super energetic and really invested in the topics that he was talking about. I loved listening to his lectures because they were super interesting. He was an awesome professor to have and really wanted to see his students succeed. He did make the class tough but it was always fair.,1
An extremely boring and redundant professor who really doesn't seem to care too much about the students. Will avoid classes that name him as prof.,0
His passion for the subject in contagious. Explains everything thoroughly and will re-explain anything you didn't understand. Tests are off the power point notes. They're MC and short essays.  As long as you pay attention in class you will do good. I didn't read the book much. DO ALL the HW because it does count for a significant part of the grade,1
Jason is your typical math prof. Not bad but not great. He does not have an accent,1
"Love Dr. Record! Really easy class, just show up and participate a couple of times. The group projects can be a pain but if you complete them with effort this class is an easy 4.0",1
"This course is a hybrid course, meaning that its a class you go to to simply do work online. MyMathLab helps a lot in refreshing your memory on past techniques and the professor is always there to help. However, he makes it clear that he doesnt teach the material.",1
"Swingley talks a lot about feminism in her classes. Even though it's an editing class, many times we talk about other things besides editing during the class period. I thought I was going to learn about commas, semi-colons, etc., but we only talked about how to address each gender in writing.",0
"I really did not like this class, Dr. Barnes was disrespectful, always went off task, never specified details for assignments and was a tough grader. You won't learn anything in this class and she doesn't give any help when asked. Probably the worst teacher I've had in college so far.",0
"Engaging lectures, interesting assignments (sometimes with vague instruction, but generally if you demonstrate that you engage with the material you'll attain a solid mark). The course was certainly anglo-centric, using mostly British media and sources to draw from for the major assignments.  Friendly and approachable, willing to help!",1
"I remember I went to several office hours and she does not know how to answer my questions. She tells me to refer to textbook (which I did prior to attending office hours). This is a horrible professor who isnt very knowledgeable of what she teaches. This is why tests are so easy, because she basically uses the textbook to come up with questions",0
This is absolutely the greatest teacher in the world. She is very specific about what she expects you to know and will go into greater detail with you about anything you have questions about. Test are cake.,1
"Seriously great prof! Interesting, funny, approachable and smart.",1
"If you have proficient writing skills you will be fine. Her workload is very average, and you have lots of time to prepare for each essay (4). She offers great feedback that really helps your writing skills. As long as you put effort into every assignment you can definitely end with an A.",1
"Shes tough, slides arent that clear, gotta study on your own if you want to pass!",0
Love this class! It's really eye-opening. Easy A if you show up to class and do the assignments ( you get 3 free absents )if you miss more you can make them up easily.,1
"He would constantly interrupt people and then complain about how they never contributed to the discussions. A better title for this course would have been, ""The Fascinating Life & Times of Michael Heffernan."" Still, he was sometimes helpful in spite of himself. He can be a really nice guy, but he chooses not to be one about 90% of the time.",0
"I graduated from cuse a few years ago and Prof Castro was an incredible professor and person in general. He genuinely cares about his students, their success and wellbeing. I took a few of his classes during my tenure at Cuse and his classes pushed my critical thinking, analysis and communication skills which have made me successful in my career.",1
great teacher. she only plays favorites because only some kids talk and other decide not to so she obviously gets to know the kids who talk more.  there is work to do but she makes it very interesting. i am not the kind of student who goes to class because i like it and i am intrested however this class i liked and was interested in.,1
He is a very nice guy who loves his students. Listening and taking notes is a large part of the class but the information that he gives is interesting. I really enjoyed him.,1
"awsome guy, horrible teacher",0
I just want everyone to know this professors is not helpful at all. Totally doesn't care about students. Why is allowed to teach?,0
"Mrs. Nicholson, is a very nice lady. The class has advanced organizers due over each chapter. The class isn't hard, but there are several assignments that you must complete in order to do well in the class. I would recommend this professor to anyone needed SED 104 or a class to fulfill the diversity requirement in general education.",1
"She is wonderful! SO helpful with course material as well understanding and caring if personal issues arise. She's not an ""easy A"", she just wants her students to reach their potential. One of the best teachers I've ever had",1
"Only gave lectures everyday, which half the class ignored because they were on their devices ignoring him. 2 exams, first worth 100pts and the other 40pts. Everyone failed the first exam so he gave a 55 point curve to everyone's exam. Same with the second exam. I passed, but I'm not sure I'd take him if information systems is your major.",0
"Great teacher! Very knowledgeable, you will learn a lot if you are interested. BIG group project for the second half of the semester. Overall his class is fairly easy, but pay attention because it's useful information for any business/management major.",1
"Did someone just say that they wanted to learn dates and times?  If that is what you want, go to a library, or go back to middle school. College history isnt about dates and times. Is it more important to know when Vietnam happened, or why it happened? Pollock is wonderful. Take his class if you are interested in history and not incredibly lazy.",1
I took her Sci Fi class as an elective. The books were great but the lectures were awful. She doesn't control class discussions and topics unrelated to the material rambled on forever. Take this with someone else.,0
Course was well planned and Prof. Moinian is truly interested in helping the students understand the course material.,1
"Nice lady, means well. Unclear on instructions, quizzes are difficult. Sometimes refuses to answer questions. She tends to pick out 1 or 2 students that she gives special treatment. I feel like she has good intentions, but is not a very good professor. Avoid her unless your life is Geology.",0
"i came to improve my speaking skills, I not only found new information, but tricks of the trade to improve my focus, I am always nervous. Matt helped me improve my skill set and that is why i took this class, when you get what you came for the professor gets an A",1
worst professor EVER! expects you to be knowledgeable about the topic & expects you to know vast amounts of technical terms & huge amounts of facts & numbers for the exams. Your grade is only 3 exams and attendance is required. I took this b/c I saw people give it a good review & it seemed easy but I dont want people to make the same mistake I did!,0
"Professor Barto was by far the best professor I have had at UNCC. He is passionate about baseball and is a really nice guy. He has two tests, which he gives you all the questions for. It's just your job to memorize the answers. You learn about baseball for the first 8 weeks, then you play softball the rest of the semester. Highly recommend.",1
"I've taken multiple courses with this professor. She is awesome. I had a lot of fun in this class. Just like any other college level course, there are expectations. If you are interested in developing your critical thinking skills and challenging your world view this is a great course.",1
"After enrolling in Chem1A this semester I can honestly say I miss him. I learned a lot from him and his teaching style was easy to understand. He is a funny, cool, chill, and understanding guy willing to work with us. Gave LOTS of extra credit which saved my grade. His tests are kinda hard but he also gives study guides which are extremely helpful.",1
"Dr. Ernst does care about her students- when I reached out to her about me not doing well, she took the time to go over things with me. However, this class is hard, and very test heavy. Her rambles include what will be on the test. Normally if she doesn't mention it in class then it won't be on the test.",1
"The course was very heavy in assignments and lectures. Very demanding in time (which they warn you of). This prof was very monotone, lectures were hard to get through. Tests were fair but there exam was very hard (for me) and not enough time (only 1 hour).",0
Super unorganized. He is not clear to what he expects in the group projects. The quizzes are only 5 points. His extra credit opportunities are few but definitely take advantage.,0
Hes a very good professor. I dont have any complaints.,1
"Taken in summer I, basically a self-taught class since it was online. There were only 6 assignments and you only get 1 chance to do them. No extra credit. You must have textbook to pass. Very easy but I wish there were more assignments so it wouldn't be as stressful. I would take again.",1
"I doubt his C++ skills.  But he's one of those ppl who can teach anything since he is a very good communicator.
 
 I really do have to wonder if another prof with more experience in C++ could teach it better.",1
"this class was my least favorite class. the teacher is hot but that doesnt make up for the total lack of personality, he is so boring i wanted to shoot myself in the face every class. plus it is some dumb experimental math class where they give you a bunch of stupid word problems. would never do this class over again",0
"No lecture slides whatsoever, class is pretty much the professor talking for 1 1/2 hours, pacing the front of the class practically just summarizing the readings. Definitely don't take the class if you have a short attention span. Prompts for papers aren't difficult but that depends on your ta. Some are lenient, others not so much.",0
"I LOVED Prof. Pilla. I was so scared of Math as I haven't done it in 6 years and he teaches in such a clear, calm way. Hes funny, is patient and wants the best for his students. 4 homeworks, 4 tests(open book) which were pretty easy. The final was so, so hard and didn't resemble what we were doing in class but apart from that, GREAT guy, GREAT prof",1
this professor sucks. if you want to fail take him. he takes points off for every little thing. you cant have the whole answer right but still get so many points off the problem bc you didnt do the work the way he showed us! dont take himmmmmm,0
"This class is extremely textbook geared. Reading is the main way we learned anything in this class. Each week you have a designated reading and a discussion post and quiz over the reading. You can take the quizzes as many times as you want. Every 4 modules we had a test. If reading isn't your strong suit, I wouldn't take this class.",1
"The material is easy to understand. BUT, she is WAY too tough when marking the group presentation. I spent hours and days on that project. Even made improvements after getting feedback from her. She gave me a C. The project is worth 40% of our grade. I am in my third year and am a straight A student. Trust me, don't take her course.",0
"He's very smart & knows what he's talking about. few grades, all essays (tough grader, helps you in office hours then marks you down anyway on what he helped with) favors the kids who participate in class, but he can be unnecessarily rude to students who do not participate and he makes passive aggressive comments often. going to class helps papers",1
"Dr Metzger stands at the front of the room, doesn't address the class, and makes you purchase a $150 book for an access code that's unnecessary considering everything could be transferred to Canvas for free. Students answer 130 questions per class instead of the professor teaching anything. I DO NOT recommend Metzger as a professor at all.",0
Don't walk..run away!  He reads straight from a powerpoint and makes things very confusing. The tests are extremely difficult...he really enjoys the essay questions.  Way too much info given for the amount of time he teaches (aka-read straight from the powerpoint). I would never take another class taught by this professor again.,0
"Really enjoyed this class, he is a great professor. Make sure to go to class and take detailed notes on his slides because that is what is on the test. DO NOT buy the book, I never cracked it open. Tests were slightly harder than I expected them to be, but still reasonable.",1
"Not sure about her from a MATH course standpoint but she made for a pretty great FYEX professor. Very interactive and engaging with her lessons overall. If there's one complain I have, perhaps she can be a bit TOO ""loose"" with her instruction style, for lack of a better word, if that makes any sense.",1
do need to read book to get A,1
Dr. Ruiz plays around to much in class and favors female students. If you don't like classical music do not take this class.,0
"He talks about literally everything in the book and when he tries to help you, he gives you a half-(you know the word) correction and doesn;t even have the decency to help you through it. You can't read his writing,so it is really hard to make corrections. Hate the teacher, but if you do the project with extra credit and do decent on tests,it=pass.",0
"Legates is a really nice guy/professor, but the class is super boring. If you're looking for a group D it's manageable but not an easy A. Only reason attendance is mandatory is because of clickers. Otherwise everything he uses is on Sakai.",1
"If you love 75 minute lectures, this is for you. Lectures are long and his tests are over 2 class periods. Only grades are 4 tests that go over 2 class periods. The problem is its 75 questions and does not relate to the lectures all that well, so its hard to study. I would not recommend, there are definitely better options at Creighton.",0
Maida was a bit difficult for me. She's a bit of a scatter-brain - didn't cater to all learning styles. Obviously calc isn't easy. She doesn't check the homework and doesn't give quizzes after lessons as often as she says she will. She's really busy so isn't often available out of class. Does test corrections for extra 5 points. Very fair grader!,1
"Prof wakem is not a great professor, his tests are not on topic of what is expected. He is not willing to budge on any grade dispute. When told a issue, all you get from him is finger violins. ",0
Great teacher!! Definitely one of my favorites which says a lot because I hate writing. He makes you work for the grade but it's not anything to hard to do as long as you participate from the beginning.,1
"Avoid!!! Nice lady but she is by far the most unorganized professor I have ever had. Posted every week's assignments late, grading criteria was unexplained until semester's end, and she never graded anything on time- seriously, not once. Can BARELY get a hold of her by email. Posted final paper guidelines 10-days late too. Not worth the headaches.",0
This teacher has a tendency to have favorites! She needs to give credit where credit is due and to whom!,0
"Avoid Spy Fiction at all costs. It will not improve your writing or analysis skills. He will only make you take ridiculous reading check quizzes that ask you for very specific details that don't relate to important themes or plot points. Basically, it's possible to read every book in depth and still fail the quiz. Don't do it!",0
Very knowledgeable and passionate about the subject.  She does her best to keep you engaged the entire lecture even though she knows a good portion of the class are not geography majors. Very pleasant class experience i would recommend to anyone.,1
"This class definitely is one of my favorites! The assignments are small and sometimes time consuming but really easy. A LOT of extra credit opportunities! Raw point scale so its easy to get an A. She is a great professor, super funny. Tough essay grader but if you go to office hours she likes that. Definitely recommend.",1
If you love photography you will love it even more once you take the B&W photography classes and James Spence is my all time favorite teacher.I just graduated this spring and I miss that class more than anything and James. I recommend you take his classes! Great teacher he knows his stuff and hes honest and you just have a great time in class.,1
Awesome instructor!!!  He really knows what he is talking about and adds interesting stories to his lectures.  He seems to really care about his students and their success in the class.  We got out early almost every week and he keeps it interesting so that the class doesn't get bored.  This class is a great night class so take it if you can!!,1
"Not hard to get a passing grade at all. However, the grading method is mainly based on opinion. This applies to the ICS 52 course as well. In other words you're not really learning anything. There is 1 benefit I got from CS 113 though, and that is networking with people.",0
"This guy is absolutey the worst in the ECE department. He teaches off of power point slides that he has made himself, can't speak english, and his lecture topics are totaly random and has no structure. As a result, u'll have no idea what he is talking about. 7000+ a term for this??? what a cracker",0
"My least favorite professor here at Calvin; he doesn't allow make-ups, is not understanding, and is just very frustrating in general.  His tests are not easy, and he doesn't give back the weekly quizzes, but instead throws them away.  During lectures he quotes from his book and then stands gaping at his own, assumed brilliance. A very bad class.",1
"I usually like going to class and don't mind paying attention but i have never hated a class as much as this one. like ever. I have absolutely no idea how i finessed a B in this class but I did. I never paid a lick of attention just read the book and took notes from it, got mediocre grades on exams and some how passed. would not recommend.",0
"The class is difficult not because the professor is bad, but because the material is challenging. That being said, the quality of lectures is very good, lots of study materials and it is defiantly possible to do well with effort. Do not blow off problem sets and be ready to form study groups. Exams are hard, but doable. Very good honors class.",1
One of the best professors I've ever had. He is always ready to listen to students ideas and discuss them. He is very open minded. And he's got a great sense of humour.,1
"she's the bomb! she expect you to come prepared, she's clear with what she wants from you, and always willing to help. amazingly knowledge-able and talented as a teacher. also a really wonderful woman to get to know.",1
Don't take English with her if English is not your strong subject.,0
"Brett is an amazing teacher and person. He is extremely understanding and while sometimes the work load was a little overwhelming, it was overall a relaxing class. I learned so much from this class and I can't say enough about what a great person he is.",1
"Largely reads off of a powerpoint. One of those classes where you won't do much but be bored in class. I prefer active interaction with Profs & students (keeps me awake). Memorization heavy, long exams (3 + final). Overall a ton of information you have to somehow retain quickly. (If you're premed, get used to it.) Not a bad choice for Micro though.",0
"I loved his class.  I like writing though.  I think that if you aren't dedicated to learning, he's probably not going to be anywhere near your favorite.  Meets privately with you twice to discuss your work and where you can improve.  Gives you every oportunity to get a good grade if you are willing to apply yourself.",1
"Honestly, I picked this teacher based on the reviews on this website. I was not impressed at all. I had a difficult time getting in contact with her, calculating my class grade was literally impossible until the end of the semester, and she definitely graded quite harshly for a freshman level class. I would not take another of her classes again.",0
"He's a really nice guy and class is actually pretty interesting, but he grades pretty harshly on essays. Reading Logs are graded a little easier but he has really specific things he looks for in essays and if he doesn't find it you'll get a really average grade",0
"Very reasonable grader, reasonable workload, and a fairly decent lecturer. His material may not always seem relevant, but it is important; attend all lectures, read all assigned readings, and do all of your assignments and you will pass this class easily. Extremely helpful, as well, and the structure of the class encourages creativity.",1
He made tests too difficult for students to pass. Was never prepared and was not very intresting during class.,0
oral presentations homework every week attendance is mandatory if you skip a class takes points off,0
I took CALC 201 before with another professor and didn't pass so I took it again with Gove. To be completely honest it was easy but only because I had take it before. His lectures are boring and he doesn't know how to explain things clearly. He does curve though and replaces homework with quizzes.,0
Very interesting class! I enjoyed her class but she was a very hard marker. Her input on my papers when I went to see her during office hours was was worth it though. I learned a lot. Do the readings and participate in the class! She likes when people participate!,1
"Professor Fleshman is a good guy, but he simply isn't good teaching Math 370. He speaks quietly and is a pushover to the louder students. He doesn't prepare you for the Calculus series  and is consistently late. His lectures last for what seems to be an eternity and makes too many mistakes during lectures.",0
"Shes amazing. I had her for Contracts 1 and 2, for 9 months of my life. Shes extremely personable and also knowledgeable about Contract Law. I had UCC before Contracts, and I still learned a lot of new things from her. Her exams are hard but practical.",1
"I don't usually give bad reviews but avoid this guy. The group projects were a nightmare. He wanted the class to feel ""real world"" by assigning you to a random group. At one point he thought about making each group ""fire"" a person and then he was going to make another group of the rejects. Lucky that didn't happen. Again don't take him.",0
"Not going to lie this class was my most difficult this semester. Bobs a bit of a tough grader and the speeches take a good amount of time to prepare. However he gives back great feedback. I actually think Ive grown as a person in his class. Im glad its over, but Im really glad I took it.",1
"Do not miss a class or you will fall behind! He doesn't use the textbook, everything you need to know for tests are in his lectures. Taking notes, however, was a joke because his lectures are so scattered, that I felt that I didn't get enough information to study with. You also need a strong background in Mathematics, which he doesn't tell you.",0
"Answer Advanced Reading questions on TopHat (easy points). Although the workbooks are long, they serve as a good resource because they include practice problems in them... Tests are difficult but refer back to the workbook for help!",1
This class relates well to life after Clarkson. He brings in guest speakers and we do an interview with them then each group in the class gives presentations. So you are really learning from your peers however he does a good job at leading conversations,1
"Lectures consist of ""learning"" terms and specific pieces which are just the quiz answers. No in depth understanding or outside example. Koehler rambles incoherently every single lecture as others have noted. Talks for mere minutes at a time about the class subject, elsewhere rants about unrelated and milquetoast conspiracies about society.",0
"She isn't the greatest professor in that she lectures most of the class and often forces you to move on from speeches right after she assigns them. She does give extra credit frequently, so make sure you do everything she asks. She is a pretty easy grader, as long as you do what she asks. She also gives a lot of work days outside of class.",0
This is my second time taking math 222 and he really helped me understand the the criteria and make connections on how everything is basically related. this is something other math teacher were never able to do. he helped me see math in a simpler way.,1
"Corrin is a nice person. However, homeworks are much harder than anything done in class and long. Tests are full of vague questions which make answering difficult even if you know the material. Often she will rush through a lecture and you will not have time to understand. If you want to do well you must depend on the book. Quizzes are every class.",0
"Very nice lady. I loved taking her class. She is very understanding and always has time outside of class to meet. Class was rather boring, but you get participation for attending. Overall i recommend her!",1
"Prof. Serbanescu was intimidating in first year physics, it's true, but can you blame her? She's dealing with swarms of mark-grubbing premeds. In the upper level course I took, she was great. Very, very nice.",1
"Julie is an amazing prof. Yes, it may take some time to warm up to her but once you show her that you are serious about learning and being in her class, she will do all she can to help you succeed.  She is amazing at explain the harder stat concepts and will always explain them in a way that is easier to understand. I will really miss her.",1
"Dr. Andersh is a great professor who truly cares about the success of his students. He is extremely attentive, very helpful & accommodating. Material on exams & quizzes will always be known. If you put in the effort, utilize the resources provided and attend class then you were certainly get the grade you deserve.",1
Total disaster couldn't get a hold of him. Don't take if you want surprises when it comes to your grade after the class is over and you see what your grade is. Grades in blackboard are different from the actual grade given.,0
Learned a lot- made me see things from a different perspective. Fun learning activities,1
"As a professor, she is one of the best I have ever had. Not only does she truly care for the students and what they are able to take away from her class, but she does see the effort that the students put into her class. She tries to help clean up students' pronunciation whenever possible, so that the students speak as authentic Chinese as they can.",1
"Though sometimes he seems to confuse things by over-complicating problems, he always puts forth the effort to explain things to students when they do not understand.  His quiz system (weekly quizzes) as well as his outside availability make it so that you will do well in proportion to how much effort you put in. I plan on taking more of his courses",1
"The most unprofessional professor I have had at UW. She wants to get out of the class more than the students. She has unstructured, unprofessional, unhelpful lectures in which almost nothing were taught. This unprofessionalism should not exists in such a prestigious program. She enjoys making your life as difficult as possible. This is a joke.",0
"Extremely hard to work with, doesn't care about her students.",0
"Great teacher, very helpful and extremely intelligent. Go to class, study for the tests and participate and he will like you. I highly recommend Dr. Misawa",1
"Lectures are easy, he repeats things in other lectures which helped a lot. I never needed to study extra at home.",1
"You have to work for a good grade, lectures are important, he doesn't give out good grades, gives good examples, the book helped me a ton on the homework, TEST ARE HARD. I always feel awful after I take them but the grade turns out better then I think it's going too.",1
supportive and harsh to. you can tell who she likes and who she doesn't. Seomtimes has attitude. Doesn't respond to emails or follow-up on things.,0
"Great teacher, this guy is like a father to me. Ok, I am just joking about that. But he is a teacher that teaches, not just preaches.  Easy A, what is wrong with that. You do learn, it is really up to you to learn, the teacher is there to calrify the subject not to study for you.",1
"Biased towards jocks. If you are anything other than a jock or an attractive girl, then he's not that nice to you.",0
Avoid at all costs. You will not be rewarded for your efforts. The content is the most useless things too.,0
"His class is a nightmare, everything he teaches you dont need to know. But everything he says 1 time write that down! Its gunna be on the test! His review covers 10% of whats on the test even though he says at the end of his review thats everything on the test. His hand writing is awful and labs good luck figuring it out yourself.",0
"Tests are not made by him. So his tests do not mesh with his teaching style. I am a son of a math teacher, and even his math oriented questions were confusing because he does not clearly go over the math part of the course. Personally, I wish there was more math so I could have had a different grasp of the information. Physics can get wordy!",0
Professor Spaeth is super kind and patient. The class is very interesting and goes into Greco-Roman magic. There is a ton of readings and some big papers which are time-consuming. Overall the class was intriguing and she was always open to helping people during office hours and gave great feedback on papers.,1
"Not a good prof at all. His lectures consisted of him just solving problems on the board while not clearly explaining how to solve it. Assigned online homework assignments which did not match content taught in class, leaving you scrambling to try and teach yourself. Does not post grades online.",0
"She was not helpful at all and never returned anything. I had no idea what my grade was, and she always gave random pop quizzes. It was a very boring class and awkward, because nobody ever participated in the discussions. Don't take her if you can avoid it!",0
"empty slides, tough quizzes, meaningless lecture",0
"The class was extremely boring because he just reads his slides, and he often diverts and talks about something unrelated to the subject, that's when I get lost after trying my hardest to pay attention. And he's not funny, although he certainly think he is.",0
"Hardest teacher Ive ever had in my whole entire life. Ive always been an A student and got my first C in her class. Very tough grader, one little mistake and you will get a low grade. Does not explain anything and if you have a question she just tells you to read your book. Very strict teacher, and most of the time she does not make sense.",0
"One of the hardest classes ive ever taken at valparaiso. I don't even remember ANYTHING and I took both semesters with him. couldnt tell you one thing about chemistry, which has gotta say something about this dude's teaching. AWFUL",0
"Professor DasBender is a wonderful professor. She is extremely nice, and we always have good in class discussions. I love the class, but she's a pretty tough grader, so if you want to get an easy A I don't recommend the class. If on the other hand you want to become a better writer and learn something, definitely take her. I would take her again!",1
The most incompetent and uncooperative prof I've ever had the displeasure of taking a course with. Assignments are constantly posted late with minimal/no adjustment to length. Even the final assessment was posted 4 days late when they had 2 full weeks with only 1 of 3 profs teaching to construct it. Assignments were sloppy+full of missing details.,0
"Very difficult to understand her teaching style. She isn't really one to answer any questions as her excuse is ""I don't have enough time"" to answer them. Her grading style is very off and seems a little unrealtic to pass the class. I don't recommend taking her if your math skills aren't up to par. She's not one to go into detail about.",0
"Sarah was enthusiastic about history, but expected way too much from her students. Homework packets were literally 15 - 25 pages long per packet and you had to complete one every week. Tests were hard. They were all short answer and essay questions and no multiple choice. I love history and am actually minoring in it, but I hated this class.",0
"As a 4.0 student at my four year college I received by first B. The content is terrible, and there are no clear instructions anywhere.",0
Horrible experience. Bad overall. You'll be better off avoiding this missile if you can. Good luck if you do take her.,0
"She was a great professor. i took her my sophmore year, and i will say that her class was NOT easy but if you go to her she will help you. If she sees you trying then she will not give up on you. She Curves all of her test. I failed all of her test but 1 before the curve and i still got an A out of her class. TAKE her but be prepared to work.",1
This teacher was by far one of the HARDEST I've had at UH.  Her notes are very mixed up and her tests suck.  They're multi-choice/fill in the blanks and essay.  NO EXTRA CREDIT ever.  I went to her for help and she basically kept repeating herself over and over again to just re-read the book even though I've already done that.,0
She will not hold your interest.,0
"The worst professor I have had at W&M. She does not communicate well with students and is very hard to reach outside of class. This class was super interesting, but head this warning and take it with a different professor. AVOID PILKINGTON!",0
worst prof.boring lectures and extreme hard final exam!!!!!,0
"I wouldn't recommend this class with Professor Orme! You do a lot of unnecessary stuff: raising a child, discussion posts & replies, written assignments. I got an A but I really had to spend a lot of time reading and the exams are hard by the way. Don't think that because its online its easy, it really isn't. ",1
"So awful. Worst professor you will have at UCONN. Her class should be for philosophy majors only, and philosophy IV or something. She grades everything so tough and if you complain to her via email she basically doesnt do anything to fix it. Take this class and youll want to die! If you have this class in your cart delete it before it is too late",0
"Really not a good teacher.  I had him for RES in 8th grade, and he told us he hoped we'd all fail.  Incoherent, unorganized and mean.  He got off topic easily and often.  We know far more about his 5 children then we want to now.  There were never clear due dates for anything we were assigned, and changed about 5 times in a 45 minute period.",0
Mark is a great professor with a wealth of knowledge. Those who don't pass his class have no business in higher education. That is how easy this class is!,1
"Pinson is the spaciest, most disorganized and most incompetent professor I've ever had. She can't keep up with the work she assigns, she drops assignments for half the class when she ""runs out of time,"" though the other half has done it, and her grading criteria are completely random. Don't take unless you have a lot of patience.",0
"Took a Ken class never having heard of him before. Changed my world, my life, my mind. THIS is education: dialogue, passion and critical thinking. It's not a syllabus, but a journey, and what I learned from Ken makes up for everything I didn't learn in school. Ken's classes are for the few who actually expect to find a little education at college.",1
"He's a very nice guy, but I like him better as a person than a professor. He jokes around a lot, sometimes way too much. Isn't really helpful, because he's very opinionated. He'll tell you how he feels,so be prepared for his criticism. Barely any work in class, no work out of class. I would take him again just because it was an easy A.",0
"He used to work at IBM. He does a good job at explaining globalization, due to the insight he learned at IBM. If you disregard his slides and just study the textbook you can do a good job, like how IBM does as a job on the global market. His stories are pretty interesting and you will learn a lot about multinational corporations, such as IBM.",1
DO NOT TAKE THIS IF you are new to concordia or struggle with doing research. He will not care much if you are in course based stream he only will to care for ones who can invent things like him. Very ignorant to people who workhard he loves talented students and will reward them extra marks. You WILL GET COMPARED WITH THESIS BASED people so DONT,1
"This man knows absolutely nothing about Muslim Fundamentalism. However, that does not stop him from giving his ""expsert"" opinion every time he can ""grandstand"". Stay away!",0
PROBABLY THE EASIEST PROFESSOR AT UCBA!,1
This was an incredible waste of time and money. Norm is a business professor trying to teach IT and CPS courses and failing. Most of the work is busy work and completely useless. You would be better off reading a book because that is all you'll do anyway. He lacks and ability to teach and instead assigns papers on modern tech to avoid doing work.,0
"I LOVE HIM!!!!! He made class fun, he has a great personality and knows his stuff well! He was nice and helpful and understanding and I cannot WAIT to take another class with him. TAKE HIS CLASSES!!!!!!",1
"I'm taking his class online and Mr. Manley is great! Encouraging, funny, and understanding. It's not too much work, and about what you'd expect for an online class. You get to learn about Adobe Photoshop too, which I love. Really cool guy who personally responds to you each week- I'm learning a lot!",1
"Jenny is by far my favorite professor I've had at UW. She is incredibly professional and knowledgeable, yet so approachable. It's clear that she cares very deeply about students. Even tough subject matter seems intuitive when she presents it. I only wish she taught more courses so I could take them. This class changed my life, take it if you can!",1
This class was interesting but extremely boring at times. A lot of the material he covers isn't even on the exam! I came to class all the time and always took notes for the first exam and barely got a passing grade. 2 exams 50% each with extra credit. I got A's in all my other classes and barely passed this class.,1
Classes pass quickly and he explains everything perfectly. Very little work and tests are easy. He makes sure you know everything you need to know for tests. Very straightforward and just wants to see you succeed.,1
"Ok, I'm biased because I have hated honors since 1st semester but he is just bad.  He doesn't care at all and it shows.  Gives you bs assignments and class was worthless.  Nice guy just a bad teacher.",0
Dr. Schwarz is an extremely tough grader who will give minimal partial credit. He also lectures for the whole 3 hour time period and provides tests that ask you about the littlest detail. The tests also dont relate to the HW problems.,0
"Mr. Burt would just read off the slides. He doesnt give a straight answer to any questions whether it be regarding course content or grading. In labs, he only gives about 15 minutes to do them them and spends most of it trying to set it up. He curves at the end of class, so you dont really know what youre going to make until the very end.",0
"Honestly, his lectures are a mess and so unorganized, and good luck writing notes and keeping up with him . There is alot of reading and papers due for the reading. The study guide that is provided is no help. Whoever is a history major please avoid taking this class. This isnt high school where you can't use the bathroom either during lectures. NO",0
"Professor Plesha was very helpful and very opinionated. If there was a mistake with grading or with a computer, he will not be too likely to take your side. Though the class is hard he makes it quite a bit easier through old fashioned good teaching. That being said, if you weren't good at math last semester, that's probably not going to change...",1
A very funny and passionate professor. Intro to Yiddish Culture is an easy but very interesting and useful class to take!,1
good style of teaching,1
"She is a very nice and caring professor. Lots of work. Lab material, labs and quizzes.",1
"Not very clear on majority of assignments and grades really tough. Makes her political views known, must be politically correct. Wouldn't even consider having her as a teacher again.",0
"Not a bad teacher. Don't listen to the other reviews. Just do the work with a friend, read the course reader it's a big help! The final is 50% of the grade but you get a SG/Mockfinal/and a 8x11 cheat sheet. She sometimes gives EC. Just put in the effort trust me, don't copy the work with a friend actually try to understand it and you will do fine",1
He is a very good lecturer who cares if you show that you care about the course and participate. He responds to emails immediately and is very understanding. He made me like Chemistry more than I would've imagined Highly recommend.,1
I think I learned more watching grass grow than being in this class. As an objective person I think his methods of teaching are a complete waste of students valuable time. All we would do is listen to other people's opinions on irrelevant topics. He is also a pretty lazy grader. Lacks constructive criticism and when he does it's a few sloppy words,0
"This prof is very intelligent but is VERY condescending.  He knows how smart he is, but does not simplify his thoughts for his lectures.  Nearly everyone I knew was frequently confused by his lectures.  I will not take a class with him again.",0
Nice guy and a great student. He understands what its like to be in college (allowing for you to turn in papers very late for almost full credit). The quizes are based on lecture and the book kinda. I didnt read once and got a b+.,1
not impressed,0
"Because of the influence of Covie-19, this class is a zoom class. He spends at least half of each class checking everyone's homework. In the other half of the class, sometimes some new knowledge will be taught, sometimes just to modify the classmates bug or own bug. The teaching speed is very slow and you will waste a lot of time.",0
Very unclear about anything.  Handed back assignments 4 weeks after we turned them in.  Makes me want to vomit everytime I am in that class.  By far the most uninspiring teacher I have had.  I have learned something in the class...shes the model of what not to be when you teach.,0
"Mr. Mac was a great teacher.  His first test was very hard, but after that the class isnt bad.  I probably would have made an A- or A if i studied harder for the first one.  He makes managerial accounting as fun as you can make managerial accounting.  I would definitely recommend him. ",1
"Was often very condescending. Quizzes on brand new material, THEN teaches it in class (sometimes). Be prepared to pay tuition for a class you have to teach to yourself. Expects you to understand things she already understands. she has a confusing accent that can confuse newer spanish students. I'd suggest avoiding her classes.",0
"Easy class, intro level, she is very unorganized though, and a little awkward, but she means well. You learn a lot more than you expect. ""text books"" are work books so you need them.",1
"Her lectures were extremely dry, and would usually go off topic in material that had nothing to do with exams (even though all testable material came from lecture and textbook). The tests are near impossible and I did all the required work, tests had nothing to do with lecture. Took this for my minor and lead to my change in minor. do not take her.",0
I dont understand his teaching at all .he is not a friendly and very difficult to understand his subject especially business students as we do not have an idea in International relations .,0
He really tries to make every effort for you to pass but you honestly have to make sure to put in the time or you won't get the grade you like.,1
Wonderful prof.  Really cares about the students!,1
"A great teacher and advisor. Very, very enthusiastic, down to earth, and helpful. His lectures are very detailed and tests are difficult, but he does cover all the information in class. He will prepare you very well with outside readings that are about current economic related topics. Knows his stuff.",1
"This instructor is the only reason this class was difficult. The rubric was barely followed, if at all sometimes. She will mark you down for random things without reason, and for things I've never had issues with before. She finished grading all my milestone papers within 15-30 minutes.  Nothing was ever clear, making this class terrible.",0
"I liked her. If you do the work and study the material, she is very fair.",1
I remember her. She was very friendly and helpful. Lectures were clear and interesting,1
rude,0
"I had Sander for Bio 108 lab. Extremely tough grader and not clear on material. She is not very clear on feedback. While she is a very nice person (I liked her personally but not professionally) I would not have her as a lab instructor again. On a positive note, she was very willing to help during non-test labs.",0
"Love this guy. His TAs grade pretty well, but make sure you study for the tests. When he sends out the study guides, DO THEM.",0
"I don't see why people complain below. She is so nice and makes the class interesting. Yes, this is not an easy A and she challenges you to write better. The expectation is high but it is not that difficult to get good grades because she let you rewrite your essays. She gives good feedback and is always available. She is def one of my fav profess",1
She was a friendly lady but was super unclear about grading and speaking your mind about topics was not an option.,0
"There are not many assignments, so it is important that you ace each one. Other than the time consuming reading, it is not a demanding class.",1
"Quizzes are meant to hurt your grade, only a few questions, and he tries to trick you.  He puts stuff on the quizzes that were focused on during lectures. Doesn't drop the lowest grade. This class will drop your GPA which is used to get you a good job. His lectures are terrible, he puts up a bunch of definitions, not many examples.",0
Traditional teacher who teaches very clearly. Tutorials give at the end of most lectures to reinforce material taught as stated below help tremendously. Multiple choice is actually hard for this course. He's a pretty nice person who wants to help.,1
"Good for math majors who just want to pass easy, bad for CSC majors who need to learn something.  Take Roger's over this guy, he is easy and fair, but has trouble explaining the material",0
"I love British Literature, buthe made it terrible. It's an easy class, but listening to him was not worth it. He thinks he knows everything, but he's really not that smart. He just stands up there and tells you simply what the text says and is not very open to discussion or opinion. If you're looking for an easy useless class, go for it.",0
"He is well planned out. His tests are not easy, but he gives you good study tips/guides. I would take him again.",1
"Online, no book, study lectures. Quizzes are easy google answers. exams are based off quizzes. Exams are easy if this isnt your first business class basically. took as senior and got an easy B. highly recommend online, 30 mins of work or less per week",0
"Read the material - take good notes and you better know how to write!!! You'll learn and you'll like it! She's passionate about lit and it's contagious! Grades are not ""give me's"" - you have to earn them!",1
hes not that good of a teacher. he cant teach at all,0
"Dr. Krause may be the most intelligent professor ive ever had in my whole educational career. She has so much to offer the social work community and has so much experience to learn from. Yes, she assigns a lot of readings but theyre for your overall benefit in the program & in your career. Highly recommend taking a class with Dr. Krause.",1
"Great Teacher, makes class fun to be in with his lively lectures and jokes. Tests are challenging proper revision and lots of little details are needed to get and High B or A.",1
"Professor Thurtle is easily one of the best professors at UW. He makes his classes intellectually challenging, while also interesting at the same time. He seems to take a great interest in what his students have to say, and his classes have never been a disappointment. Take him if you can!!",1
"Prof McKean is the only teacher for this course.  He IS hard and says it on day 1.  Marks your papers up and does not take time to help you when you come to him. Notice other students papers received an A for the same issue I got a D. Rude, caters to his former students, treats others like in kindergarten. Not patient. ""Pay attention in class!""",1
I have never had more issues with a teacher. I have had to email him about every assignment to get a clear understanding of where to even start. Class does help except when something goes wrong and he just skips it(when that information is important)and never comes back to it. He was showing us something on a past assignment and the average was 59%,0
"His accent is tough and he doesnt really tell you when to expect a quiz, so make sure you study after every lecture. If you use your phone he will kick you out of class, but with fair warning. He tends to only explain the bare minimum of a topic and doesnt really go into greater detail of tough problems that you will see on the exam.",0
"NO WAY!  VERY opinionated, and if you disagree with her views...WATCH OUT!  She hates extra curricular activities. Her class is pretty difficult but she did make an effort to help everyone.",0
"He is decently personable, but an absolutely horrid Professor. If you dont tell him exactly what he wants to hear (where hes a very lenient grader), be prepared to have your grade docked significantly unless you have what essentially amounts to a court case of evidence to back it. A tried and true Neoliberal boomer.",0
"This is a great class if you want to learn. She is funny and keeps the lectures interesting. Make sure you do the reading because she will call on you. Study for the tests and take good notes. Not a lot of homework, and the homework that is assigned is easy.",1
"Lectures are pretty pointless, theres no tests and the lectures don't correlate with the two essays or group projects/homework.  attendance points during lecture so you have to go.  the t.a.'s grade all the work so depending on which t.a. grades your stuff determines your grade.  aitken is a good lecturer though, entertaining and is happy to teach",1
"As a person, Don is a nice guy. I can't argue that. He'll help if you can pin him down long enough to get a question answered, but that can be tricky. He ""explains"" by reading off the slides, and when asked to clarify rushed through examples. I didn't mind him sharing his personal life, but it didn't help on the days that we ran out of time.",0
"Smart and nice lady. But, takes very long to grade anything. Did not know what my true grade in the class was even up until the final exam. Takes long to respond to emails. Cant use computer in class. Tests are very hard. If it wasnt for other class assignments, I probably would have failed her class solely because of her.",0
Dr. Skerpan-Wheeler made it extremely difficult to succeed in her class. Her directions for essays are SUPER unclear and she isn't eager to help or answer questions. She puts nothing on Canvas and even waits until the day of to post an essay assignment. All of the assignments are given during class so if you miss you have no idea whats happening.,0
I took both of his art history classes. I love his class. He has traveled the world doing archeological work and has seen many of the pieces of art that he covers. He has amazing stories and you will never be bored. ,1
Tests are so hard and so specific. Readings are so content heavy and you have to memorize the smallest of details.,0
"Professor Connolly is a great professor. The topics taught for the Disney class is enjoyable&interesting so it made it easier to pay attention to the material. Take notes in the class and watch the videos and movies required if you wanna pass. She drops the lowest test grade. Overall very easy class, especially if you love Disney.",1
"Dr. Ashcraft is one of the nicest, most informative, helpful professors I have ever had. He is truly passionate about his subject material and is concerned about presenting the content in an interesting way for his students. Strongly recommend taking one of his classes for the experience and exposure to content.  AMAZING experience.",1
"Like other negative reviews, he does give pop quizzes and is a bit rude, however Lab class is Lab and his lecture doesn't really matter as you need to memorize the lab lists and models for the exams. Hes pretty much there for any extra info you need but 99% of Lab is just memorizing the lists and models",0
"Worst professor I've ever had. I'm not a good writer by any means and he did anything but help improve my skills. He is unintelligent, ignorant, and disorganized. Assigns to much work and grades harshly, assignments are misleading and lack optimal choices for questions. DO NOT TAKE HIM. ",0
Took a business class for a general theme...Tarjan made it seem as if his class was the only one on campus. Unclear with directions for his assignments and makes class more difficult then it should be. I don't recommend this professor.,0
"Dr. Ford is a wonderful professor and shows a lot of interest in what he teaches. I was not interested in plants at all before this class as took it because it was a requirement, but this is the class I have learned the most and taken away from than any other course. Labs, midterm and lecture final fair but lab final worth 30% is difficult.",1
"Witherwax is awesome.  This class is so much fun and he really makes every second interesting.  Very knowledgeable and you'll learn a lot.  VERY little work, but he can be a bit of a tough grader.  Midterm, Final, and 3 quizzes.  Good class to take.",1
"Brian Jones is not only an excellent professor, he is an excellent person. He is so kind, understanding, and encouraging. Physics is tough especially for those who have never taken it and he breaks it down. GO TO TILT TO DO YOUR HOMEWORK. It will save you. Also practice practice practice & write down everything you possibly can on exams for points.",1
"If I could do it again I would drop her class. The class itself was boring. It is a science based class so be prepared to learn about the science part of nutrition such as hyrdogen bonds ect. Her tests were multiple choice. A lot of the questions were obscure. Bottom line take Geology for your science requirement, not nutrition",0
Not hard!  I failed acct207 once and took her classed and Aced it.,1
"His lectures are boring. He tends to be behind schedule. But, he's friendly and fair with his deadlines.",0
Great teacher both for people who are attending school while also working--she's very understanding about that and her night classes often get out early.  Also great for fulfilling science credits when you're not into science.  Her main goal is to peak your interest in science; not to make you an expert. Go to class--much easier if you don't miss!,1
"His lectures don't line up with anything that will be turned in for a grade. He does do lectures based on the upcoming lab assignment, but that's just him reading the posted document(s) to the class. He posts most material online and usually will just read off of those during lecture. It's an intro course but background knowledge is required.",0
"He's not a bad human being and when it comes to the materials he explains them pretty well. For essays, he's an extremely harsh grader; I never understood what he wanted and made about 3 revisions for each essay and still I got a C in that class. We're alotted appointments with him, but those are NOT CONSTRUCTIVE. He's also very condescending",0
"I thought this class would be interesting, but he provdides no chronological order to his lectures and its very hard to find a link to all the info he is giving you. A nice man but expects alot out of his students, and a hard marker.",0
"Literally the worst professor, his lectures are terrible and you learn nothing unless you read the textbook or watch the documentaries.",0
He stands over the projector and talks to the projector more than anything else.  The tests are tough.  He spent a lot of time going over stuff that was easy and basic.,0
"The most boring professor and hardest class at this school. She mumbles when she talks so when writing notes you really have to pay attention. The exams take a full week. One day for an essay and one day for multiple choice, but she would never be clear what the exams were going to be over so I dropped the class to save myself from failing.",0
super boring,0
"Not bad online by any means. Kind of slow to grade things. Gives material in 2 week chunks which is nice. Lectures are a little difficult to understand but he offers practice exercises that aren't graded to help learn the material. Wasn't too tough and provided feedback on nearly everything, although it felt insincere and somewhat pre-made.",1
"Exceptional!! Funniest stories I've ever heard, but you have to appreciate the nuances of life. Best social science teacher I've ever had.",1
"This is classified as an intro to the history major, but it is absolutely not taught like one. I regularly would take notes on his 1:15 lecture, and would look back and none of it made any sense or connected at all. Forced us to write the term paper on his specialty, Thomas Paine. Other Hist. 301 classes get to choose their own topic.",0
I took Dr. Liszka in my undergrad. I thought she was great!! I wished I would have taken more classes with her. Her class isnt easy but it is very entertaining and informative. She also was so funny in lectures. I say go for it! Youll definitely learn something about Egypt.,1
"Mark Zeigler is by far one of the most outstanding individuals in the world. He is a treasure of FSU and delivers every lecture with great personal anecdotes and humor. His class is completely transformational, inspiring, and would recommend every to take it. There are two speeches and two exams. If you put the effort in you will get an A.",1
not a fair grader. there is no partial credit. you can work as hard as hard as you want and he always throws wrenches into his tests. very upsetting when I get test back and IT WAS GRADED LOWER THAN EXPECTED. I DO NOT RECOMMEND,0
"4 exams, weekly quiz, 12 credits participate and a few essays",0
"This was a very tedious class and the tests were extremely hard. Office hours only one day each week, but the hours run all day until 4 pm and no other accommodations made. Dr. Draper is a genuinely kind person and will take time with you if you ask and support you. Interesting subject, although lectures are hurried so write fast!",1
The best teacher I ever had in cs classes. Explains well and well organized! Makes helps sessions so students can get some help from others. Challenging lesson,1
This man is a terrible professor. His class is boring. Out of all of the staff in the English Department I had the worst dislike for him. Attendance is a must but that is self explanatory. I took his ENL 369 Gender and Negotiation class. He is unfair with his grading and is not understanding at all. He grades very harsh and low.,0
"Denemark is a very intelligent professor and knows a lot about what he is talking about. His tests are very tough but if you do your reading you can get a good grade, reading and going to class are both very important. As long as you are interested in the class and do your work you will do well. He is a great prof and is very funny and helpful.",1
"You NEED to KNOW and INSTALL: Wireshark,Subnetting,NMAP, VMWare, How packets send/rec. He assigns Group projects every few weeks. Gives a HUGE curve at the end BUT he WILL EMAIL you to tell you that you need to DROP the course based on your Quiz,Midterm,etc. Study HW problems - Quiz is based on it. Write all he writes on board.IF LOST GoToHisOFFICE",0
Worst class I've ever taken. You can try to pay attention but he has the most boring voice I've ever heard and reads slides off the overhead for almost 3 hours. Half the class fails every test and the assignments are really tricky. I got at least 3 emails from students in my class every single dy becasue he wouldn't respod to anyones emails.,0
"Professor Neilson is hilarious and her class is really fun and  engaging, however she can be very unspecific when it comes to what she requires for her papers. She will show examples of what she doesn't want but never of what she does want. This is infuriating as its really hard to improve from one paper to the next. You won't get an A.",1
Go to class and labs as he takes attendance and this may have a effect on your final mark as he tends to bell curve the final grades. He can't teach as well due to his heavy accent but if you read the textbook you should be fine. Amazing professor overall sad to see him retire.,1
"Nice guy, fine teacher. Got bored and distracted every once in a while, but I still got an A. If you are good at Psych, you will do fine.",1
"NO! Absolutely terrible professor. Do the readings at home, write the paper and hand it in. Zero point in going to the lecture, all he does is summarize what you've already read and understood in the most condescending way possible -- like you aren't capable of understanding basic literature. Extremely arrogant, disrespectful to students, paranoid.",0
Never has exam grades added up and does them fast before hands them back.  Both my exams were added up wrong so far this year and had to track him down to get them corrected. Tests you on things like calculations that he has never taught you how to actually do in class.  Never returns class case study assignements so we dont know our grades,0
"I took her Child Development class over the summer. The 40 question chapter homeworks seemed so easy until you really got into them. There is always more than one right answer (all taken right out of the book) and you just have to guess which one she says is ""most correct"" what a joke! She never replies to emails, tests arent like homework. ugh.",0
Dr Kelley was a great instructor. She provides rubrics for assignments and gives great feedback. This was an honors class and we had 10 annotations to do which were kind of hard. Shes very responsive to emails and gives extra credit. She provides all of the notes needed on class instead of a textbook which is great!,1
"As a teacher Dr. Lewis is awful. He is far too lenient on grading students' work, he ""teaches"" every lesson by having the class read definitions from the textbook out loud, shows little-to-no passion or enthusiasm for the course, and he often forgets important dates on the syllabus.",0
"He's a Harvard grad who's been teaching at UD for maybe 40 years.... Very pretentious and knows everything, and absolutely everything. WILL take up the whole class period, and go over. Make sure to read whatever is assigned.",1
"This guy isn't all that bad. He's very difficult and full of himself...but he genuinely wants us to succeed and gives us numerous opportunities to do well. Not only did he gave us two extra credit opportunities, there are also four exams and an optional final, and quizzes which he takes the top five grades. He's really not so bad.",1
Professor Gillespie is an awesome guy.  He really cares about students and is always willing to help. I struggle with the class and Gillespie was always available during office hours to help me.  There is a lot of material in the course so a lot to know for exams. But it is possible to do well.,1
advise: don't bother attending,0
Wish I would have taken her for all English related classes. ,1
"He has little structure to his lectures, and he admits it. Essentially, he's just standing there talking to himself and it can be engaging but if you try and get away without reading the material during the same week, you will screw yourself. That being said, he's a fair marker and he appreciates creativity and enthusiasm more than being right.",1
"Picky, judgmental, spastic, condescending, and overly regulatory. Avoid!",0
lectures were so subjective based on his opinions and he made anyone that disagreed with his ideas feel inferior. the syllabus wasn't followed and there wasn't a clear grading rubric and the prof also didn't have a gradebook so you never knew you're standing in the class. the material isn't difficult but I wouldn't recommend this class to anyone,0
"Please don't take this class...I study almost every day for this class and I am still struggling. Ive never stressed so much over a course so much before. I asked him for help, he didn't do much. ",0
"Alright, not an easy A class. Maybe a easy B class.",1
"WORST DAMN TEACHER EVER!
 Not only can she not stay focused during class, she needs to ask for a copy of the syllabus just to see when her own assignments are due.
 
 Worst of all she is just a mean lady.",0
"He's a really good lecturer and is very clear and passionate. He fits a lot of info into an hour so don't miss the lectures! He does have a point of view that is practically immovable so if you disagree, be prepared to have a strong logical and intellectual debate. Take the class if you have a passion for it because you have to work for it",1
"She is a good teacher, and well organized. She grades relatively fast, but at the end it was a little slow. You know about all the assignments before school start, because she emails you. She is kind, but does not take late assignments so please do your work. She give ample time to do them for the most part.",1
By far my favorite teacher. He makes Calculus so easy and tries to make sure everyone passes. Your actual grade likely wont be the grade you get. For example if you get a C he will give you a B. He only teaches the basics. I'd get to know him not only because he is very nice but also because if you show you care he will help you out. TAKE HIM!!!,1
Information overload. Peter tries to cram in way too much material in too little time.,1
A valuable course by an amazing professor with emphasis on literary theory.,1
Professor Fitzpatrick was such an amazing professor. She is willingly to help on any essay she has assigned and is very concise with her comments on essays. She encourages her students to do well and is very passionate about the subject she teaches. I would love to take more of her classes.,1
"The amount of work needed for each lab is absolutely ridiculous! It takes 10+ hours to complete a lab that counts for about 2% not even. Marking is rough, the labs feel like a whole course to themselves. My time would much better be spent studying on the chem course and on my other courses than writing labs. Online makes everything much harder.",0
Rodell is an amazing professor.  He really tries hard to help you and will always schedule office time with you if you need.  He is funny in a quiet way and interested in what he is teaching.  AMAZING professor for Bio 121.  (and all other bio classes),1
"Patty definitely does love the subject she teaches, and is a very nice person.  However, her classes are very dull and boring, and usually cover material that never appears on tests.  Her marking is also really hard! I would avoid taking a class with her at all costs!",0
Dr. Bezner is one of the best physics professors ever.  He can make the most complex concept seem incredibly simple.  I'm sorry to see him retire.  The school will miss him tremendously.,1
Super easy class.  You learn nothing and he cannot string 6 or more words together into a coherent sentence but all you have to do is mention John Howard on your exam and you are guaranteed an A!,0
"Dr. Labelle is a good teacher, very kind, involved with the class and gives good feedback. This class, however, is challenging. The class is all about running the Rethink Campaign; that's all that you'll be doing. So the entire class is like one big group project all semester long. But, Dr. LaBelle was very helpful and responsive throughout.",1
"Nice and funny guy. Gives his class a very comfortable atmosphere and makes it his job to learn your name. He cares about your grade if you do. 4 take home essays and 3 in class, all easy if you attend and pay attention in class.",1
I never felt valued in the class and he never really listened to my opinions.  Very set in his ways.  I'll be looking for a different professor in my other courses.,0
Easily a top three candidate for the worst teachers I've had in my life.  Tests were incredibly subjective and she seemed to have no real passion for actually teaching students.,0
This guy can't teach. Period. I'm a comp sci major and had all A's in my comp sci classes until this one. He mumbles off slides and you can't hear what he's saying. His tests and projects don't reflect the material. Don't waste your time attending class. It's so boring. Just stay home and read the book.,0
Very mediocre instructor; unexciting and doesn't generate much enthusiasm for the material,1
"Only take him Only if you absolutely DO NOT HAVE any other choice, if you do have  choices , please take somebody else. Stay away from this guy, he doesn't help at all.",0
"By far the worst professor I have ever dealt with. Class is difficult to begin with but the fact that she was completely unreachable for the first 3 weeks of a six week course was the icing on the cake. Outdated syllabus with incorrect due dates, frequently confused 12AM and 12PM when setting deadlines, and overall awful. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!",0
"Thorough, direct, and incredibly organized.  Takes a pragmatic approach to the subjects and presents difficult material in a very clear fashion.",1
"Laurie is THE best. Her class is not difficult by any means, yet I feel like I learned a ton from her due to all the experience she has working in the industry. She is hilarious and made an 8:45 am class bearable.",1
"Cares about his students a lot, do not piss him off, attend his lectures. He is very willing to help.",1
klefstad was alright for 45c but 122b was definitely too big of a jump for him. the class was a mess. i would have been more understanding if they had handled the problems better. the TAs and professor should have lowered the insane workload once they realized how many mistakes were in all of their documentation/instructions,0
Class is not easy. A lot of studying is required. I made a B however I had tons of old tests which you will need as a guide for the in class tests. He gives no quizzes only 4 exams which will not be dropped but he does curve. GET OLD TESTS!,1
Awesome prof; truly cares about students and thoroughly knows her material.,1
"Super chill, a great dude. I'm taking his online course and so far it's been very easy. Study your slides & study guide and it's a breeze! Shares A LOT of random (psychology related) videos in the announcements. Super helpful outside of class also.",1
"He is kind of intimidating, but nice when you talk to him. However, the lab talks are very confusing not clear and if your not right beside him you can't hear anything! Labs are so unorganized and so hard to understand what to do exactly.",0
"Wendy is really a perfect instructor if you want to learn something rather than get high grades. She answers all the email questions, sometimes even midnight.",1
Worst prof I have ever had very rude and unprofessional. I would wait to take the course rather than take it with him.,0
Angela is the most helpful teacher I have ever had at ECU. She genuinely cares and wants you to succeed. As long as work hard and come to class you will get a good grade. Awesome sense of humor too!,1
"Not thorough. I am a very rigorous studier and, after giving it my all, I still felt I didn't understand. He doesn't seem to understand his own class! Unfortunate that he is the only one teaching ochem2 @ OCCC. My advice - take it somewhere else.",0
"He is great. Make sure you go to class for the in-class quiz things they will help with the tests and count as participation for your grade. Tries to keep it exciting, but most of the jokes are terrible. Study a lot for the tests. Taking pictures of the slides is also a good idea. Book not needed goes directly off the powerpoints.",1
"she was good, and from what i understand the easiest person to take automata from. sure she got confused on the problems, but thats because its a lot to digest. take it with her. she explained whole concepts to me in email.  she is clear as they come for this class.",1
"Dr. Park is the best professor I have ever had for a class. He is very straight to the point and teaches things in a way that is easy to understand. He does give pop quizzes once a week, so study before each class a bit. But the pop quizzes are helpful because they are exactly like the tests.",1
"It's great to listen to him talk, which is pretty much all that happens in his class. He's very brilliant, very opinionated, and very lazy. Don't try too hard when writing papers for him - he doesn't care about structure at all.",1
"He live streams and records his lectures so you don't have to attend in person. He has good examples and I had a good understanding of the material. Seemed like he had other priorities this semester. Didn't send out ANY grades for our labs/hw. Often canceled class or said ""online class today"" like 3-4 hrs before class and was late a lot too, idk",1
"Class was extremely boring. Slides could have been more organized. Only 6 grades for the whole semester so don't slack off. Study for tests, they are hard.",0
"He knows what he teaches. There are labs and homework, if you do them on time and work with your classmates, you will be fine. Quizzes are mostly about what he taught in class, so it's very crucial to be present in class. Exams are easy too if you read your textbook and have been present in class. I learned a lot in this class.",1
"Excellent teacher, but tough grader.",1
"Janson is by far the best art history teacher I've ever had. He's very kind, lively, and excitable, and he obviously loves Renaissance art. I've used the knowledge I got from his class in my illustrations, which is a first. It's tough, I got a D on the first test but got As on all the others for overall A. Pay attention to him, he's great!",1
"She is very difficult, you must spend a lot of time doing her work online. The work is not hard if you know your stuff, its just how much she asks for. If you do not answer within the right dates or answer it the way she wants it to be answered you WILL get a 0. She doesn't give partial credit AT ALL!!",0
"Don't take this guy by any means. If you ask a question, he'll make you feel stupid, goes through material very quickly and doesn't explain things if you get it wrong. Pretty much had to get a tutor and teach myself all of Tax I",0
Dr. Liu is an amazing professor.,1
"O'Hagan teaches French and its grammar very clearly even for those who don't know grammar in say English. And since his native language is English, he knows where anglophone students are coming from. So he knows when to give a translation for a difficult word, unlike the native french profs. I wish he taught all the french grammar courses.",1
"Teacher very unclear, worst online class I've taken along with the professor. Like taking a class with a robot in charge. You get ONE chance for everything in the class unlike other teachers. The homework, discussions, quizzes, final, projects. Provides absolutely NO feedback on why she gave the grade.",0
"Good professor, hard class. Lots of work. Weekly assignments that at sometimes seem impossible. TA will get you through it. Start early!",1
"Professor Bennett is truly a gem at Carleton. She was by far the most helpful prof I have ever had. She makes the first year transition easier, which is appreciated by all of her students. One of the most respected people at this university.",1
"Professor Mitchell really knows what she's talking about; it shows in her lectures. This class is really difficult, but not impossible. It requires a lot of study and application-memorization will get you nowhere in her course. Even though I was initially scared by this course, it can be fun and I'm really glad I took it. DO NOT BUY THE TEXTBOOK!!!",1
"Extremely easy course. You pretty much just have to show up and you'll get an A, since he's gotten really strict with his attendance policies since everyone used to cut. Only 2 projects which are extremely easy, and the final, which about 90% of the class cheats on. If you don't know what to take for one of your science gen ed's, take this class.",1
He's a great prof but it's hard to pay attention to him talk throughout the entire lecture. Not everything he says in lecture is important but if he's talking about his own research you better pay attention. His portion of the tests focus mainly on his own work rather than actual course material.,1
"Littlejohn is a great professor. Those who tend to complain are typically students that put in minimal efforts and expect to be rewarded for simply showing up. If you take the time to participate and read the (actually) interesting course materials, she recognizes and appreciates it. She provides you with ALL the tools you need to be successful. A+",1
"I recently had this professor and the class was a hybrid class. It was very disorganized and he changed his mind very often. He would also teach one way, then do it a complete different way saying the first way was wrong. He wasnt very understanding of the class and didnt help anyone who asked for it. He seemed careless and didnt show support.",0
"Lamy is an amazing professor but his class is really hard. He's not teaching IR 210 anymore but when I took it, I took it as a GE and it was far too much work for a GE.",1
"Dry personality, sounds like the Clear Eyes guy.  Put me to sleep a good portion of the time if I didn't have my coffee.  REALLY IMPORTANT READ THE BOOK OR FAIL! TAKE NOTES OR FAIL! Attendance is necessary for his extensive notes.",0
"Meh. Her lectures were very ambiguous. She made already difficult concepts very hard to understand. I do think she knows a lot about plants and fungus, but just does a horrible job explaining it to the class.",0
"Mr. Rico is very passionate about what he teaches, having a consistent energy whenever he goes into lectures. I can tell he works really hard to prepare and is good when it comes to the amount of homework he gives out, it being very little. He teaches with a positive attitude and is always open to questions.",1
"Professor Roy will challenge you in ways you never thought were imaginable. He is the most intelligent teacher I have had for any class at UD. He really knows the material so well. He may be tough, but that is because he has high expectations of students, and you will meet them. You have to be willing to put in the work to succeed in this class.",1
"Della Cook is extremely intelligent, passionate, and invested in students' success. Often weekly readings/writings were required, but if you're easily overwhelmed, she is willing to fudge the due dates. Beware: she's a huge rambler, but everything she says is pretty interesting.",1
I miss him.  I wish I could have worked with him more.,1
"This course is amazing - the readings are heavy, but very interesting. Catherine is spectacular, very profound, and very kind. She tells a lot of really great stories and takes a great, holistic approach to the course. I recommend this course to everyone - you won't regret it. This course (and this teacher) are why I'm becoming an Anthropologist!",1
Antiquated professor who needs to learn how to use Blackboard and PowerPoint or a computer.    The amount of work required for minimal points of extra credit is ridiculous.  Your entire grade is dependent on tests alone.,0
"I was NOT fond of her instructional approach. She seemed to rush through the material. When I asked for assistance or guidance she was not very optimistic or supportive. She's arrogant, not very approachable, judgmental, and called people out when they make a mistake speaking Spanish.  I've never had any issues with any professors, until this lady.",0
"Has outstanding teaching and research experience, and is well-respected by his colleagues and serious students of Sociology; has a genuine interest in seeing his students succeed!",1
"Idk how, but somehow she made a science class subjective. She wouldn't let us see what mistakes we made on the quizzes and she would say things like ""technically that's right, but it's wrong"". The way she worded her questions would give them multiple interpretations, making it hard to get a good grade. She is very caring, but not great at teaching.",0
Gave a lot of tests. You have to pay attention or read in order to pass.,0
"The lecture aren't mandatory and are pretty useless since she rambles for half of the lecture time about examples that don't make sense to the unit. The homework is cumbersome, but it isn't particularly hard. Overall not a very good teacher, and someone who I wouldn't recommend.",0
"Sucked a lot. We watched videos all the time and the tests were from the book but she NEVER taught from the book. She made up silly assignments as well. She was strange, very odd.",0
"I had to take this class online. The reviews here made this class seem decent, but it is awful. Lectures are twice as long as they should be. Lectures are straight from the book, but the HW and Tests are SO much more difficult. Have a question? Good luck! He never answered any emails. Circuitry is my hobby but this class was near impossible.",0
Quite possibly the coolest person alive. A-rudd is the only person I know that could wear a suit jacket that does not match his tie along with flip flops to  class and get away with it cuz he is the creator of fashion.,1
"If you dont lik long lectures and have trouble sorting out trough lots of information, good luck. Like myself there where many people who had trouble in the class and even though it was apparent she never bothered to go back over things or review any kind of material.",0
"He doesn't know much, except what he knows. Very ideological and narrow-minded.",0
"1. Promotes not helping others in order to screw them out of a grade. 2. Participation is completely arbitrary. 3. Terrible person overall. Makes you pay for the book along with his website. 4. Does NOT use the school's email system or website. 5. Grades are arbitrary and hard to understand. 6. TA carries the class, hopefully they are good.",0
"She gives you like 1 example during lecture and expects you to be able to figure out the rest of the homework that she doesnt cover, on your own. She also doesnt give extra credit so basically if you are failing you're screwed.",0
Jennifer is rude to her students for no apparent reason. It makes learning very difficult.,0
"I swear this man wrote his assignments at 3 am on a Friday night without even worrying about if they made any sense. Never responded to my email concerns, even after I went to his office hours and he gave me another email. I'm glad CS is a field where you can teach yourself, because that's all I did.",0
"Fun, sweet, very down to earth, definitely recommend her.",1
"I've taken two of McMurry's classes this year, BIOL234 and 235. Skimmed by 234 with a C and am probably getting a D in 235. We took 1 test from January to April, and then the last four tests were crammed in the last few weeks of the semester. She's really intelligent and knows her stuff, her class is just incredibly difficult.",0
"He is a nice guy but such a bad teacher. He uses all the class time to lecture us on the information that we had already been lectured on in class and doesn't tell us anything on how to the the lab. He contradicts himself a lot so you never understand what his expectations are for you. It was so bad, my worst class for sure.",0
"Ms. Hilton is an excellent teacher. She does talk and write a little fast, but she is more than willing to go back and explain anything. I am not a math person but the quality of the teacher makes the difference. She gives plenty of opportunity for extra credit so take advantage and the moduals.Get to know your classmates and you will be successful",1
I am in the process of taking one of his classes and so far so good. He is very caring and reachable outside of class. He wants us to succeed and will do whatever he can do to help make that possible. The class is very paper heavy but you should expect that in an English course. He is very clear as to what he is expecting on papers. Meet with him.,1
"Dont get me wrong this prof is very sweet & kind but she is a very hard marker! Make sure you show up to lecture & do your readings or you wont pass. She also has her favourites that she tends to be more lienent with. She canceled a class, and didnt lecture us on those chapters too which sucked. She was an okay prof but I wouldnt take her again",0
I loved this Professor. I took him for design 100 and 101 and if I could I would take anything else from him that he taught. He is clear with what he wants but also very flexible towards your creativity. Over all very helpful and inspiring,1
"Jim is the kindest prof I've had at GV. The class is discussion-based, which made it much easier than I was expecting. Although students mainly direct the class, Jim's lectures were very meaningful and you can feel his passion for poetry. He didn't give much feedback on writing, but he's a very easy grader. I hope I get to take another class of his",1
"Jude is awesome. Funny, helpful, and a real joy to talk to. You absolutely have to show up to class and you must pay attention. She does not like to repeat herself.",1
He sucks. He puts his religious beliefs on his test and just sucks a lot.,0
I never understood logarithms until Alisa explained them to me. She take the time to sit down with you and go over things until you understand. Very patient and breaks things down step by step. Great professor!,1
"Seriously love this lady. She has the funniest stories and is just super nice. Obviously a conversation class isn't going to be a walk in the park, but she made it a class that I enjoyed going to. Just participate in class and you should be good.",1
"Although Calculus is very difficult, he taught at very reasonable rate. I understood the material during class but his tests were extremely hard. Only had about 10-13 problems each test while there were only 3 tests plus a final. He used easy examples during lecture but put difficult questions on the test. I would not suggest taking him.",0
Super boring. Don't take this class unless you love birds. ,0
"I have mixed feelings about this professor. His lectures are very helpful and gives great examples for the tests. However, some of the test material I have never seen or heard in my life and I read the textbook and went to every class. I ended up getting a B. Sometimes he curves or gives extra credit. He is funny but also condescending.",0
"He's a good teacher, but material is kind of confusing. Singer's great though.",1
yes he knows his stuff but he just goes over his terrible and boring powerpoint. the book sucks and there is a lot of reading.,0
Easy class overall... a little too much homework for my tastes though.,1
"Dr. Barnes is really funny and passionate but for a required freshmen course, she grades way too harshly on speeches. She doesnt realize we arent all communication majors. Also her stories are funny and interesting but classes are pointless because she spends 5 minutes on the material and then talks about herself and her family the whole class",0
You haven't seen a great professor until you have had this guy! I had him back in 2011 and here I am writing a review to let everyone who's reading this now to know that his class is fantastic! I miss having him as a professor! Love you Mr. Martin!,1
"She is really tough, but knows her stuff. Can be somewhat rude and disrespectful sometimes.",0
Worst professor for finance. Quizzes and homework are not multiple choice and There is no instruction or practice problems similar to them. So disappointing to see a professor that can care less about his students.,0
He really is an amazing person and teacher. I promise getting to know him will change your life. Best teacher at ECU. He is what I wanna be like when im 60. Great man. TAKE THIS CLASS. TAKE THIS CLASS. TAKE THIS CLASS. you won't regret it i promise.,1
"Peter is a good professor, and he is really knowledgeable of the subjects he taught. He may seem a little weird at first, but turns out to be a cool guy. He offers extra credit during the semester which is always a plus. We read a book throughout the semester and he split the book into two quizzes which were easy if you read the material.",1
"I took Professor Jewell my senior year for Comp 2. She is an extremely hard grader. She assigns very long papers. She doesn't put your grades on PAL until the very last day of the semester, so I didn't know I was failing until about 2 weeks before the semester ended. She doesn't ever help out, and she's strict on attendance. She will drop you!!",0
"He tries to make sure that everyone is on the same page and understands the criteria for each project. He gives lots of homework, but it's all pretty easy stuff. As far as a color theory teacher, I would definitely recommend him to anyone. It might take him about half the quarter to warm up, but when he does, he is a funny and nice guy.",1
Very scary and mean....class is a waste of time and she grades like a witch,0
"Gives study guides for tests. as long as you know those you will be good for the test. lets you choose 6 of the 7 questions on the test. Lectures are boring, but important. Take notes because most of the test questions are in the lectures.",1
"Russel refuses to use blackboard for any communication, updates, course content or any other reason. He then gives lectures on a fairly complicated and dry subject which consist of him simply saying ""do this, click that, copy this"" without ever actually TEACHING anything. He simply shows completed code on the screen and displays it line by line.",0
"He was an awesome teacher, met once a week for lab, would dismiss you early. He expected you to know material, you HAVE to study. But an awesome teacher.",1
If your not familiar with sign don't take this class it might not be for you. She is a very kind lady but she goes at a very fast-paced. she is deaf so if you don't know sign it makes it really hard to communicate if your not understanding,0
He is honestly not a well professor. I've tried studying many way to get through his class and still only do ok. I put so much into it. I found out the only way to do well on the final is by simply reading the textbook and listening to his lectures online. That's the best bet and it helps me get a decent grade. His slides don't help.,0
"Cotter is awesome! He has been teaching for years and what he does works! Lectures go into detail and interesting real world experience and stories Cotter has, that touch on topics from the book. Whole class is 3 exam grades, which means no homework! He has experienced so much, and might be one of the smartest people I have ever met.",1
Didn't even buy the book. Didn't show up to class and passed with a B. Gives study guides that are essentially the test. Take this class lol! 4 Exams,0
"Really great and rewarding class, I loved it!  You'll find your art improving a lot with it!  Teacher is very nice and helpful. You'll do just fine if you have an interest for the subject",1
"She explained the course material well and the in class excersises helped with applying what you were shown in lecture. Tests and projects all seemed fair as all the material on these were covered in class. Overall this course really helped me gain a firm understanding of program, as it focuses more on the programming concepts.",1
"Think twice before you decide to take this class during summer. Cannot remember when was the last time that I met a professor who would disrespect students in front of the whole class to comfort his anger. Extremely harsh grader, pray for B before getting any of your work back. A condescending professor, not a qualified educator.",0
He uses a work book that has very poor explanations and he just expects us to learn from that. He rarely explains things to the class or actually teaches. He just has use go into our own little groups and do something we don't understand. His class is a mess. We don't know what we are doing or why. he randomly stops talking for several minutes.,0
Terrible professor. Does not explain things well and he is very unorganized. This class was  a nightmare. If you wanna pass crib your whole way through it!!!!!,0
"His tests are very specific, which makes them really hard. However, he is super approachable and is always willing to help you understand the material if you ask him to. I'd definitely recommend him to anyone. He'll make you work hard but you will definitely learn a lot.",1
Would NOT recommend taking her classes. Lectures are all off slides and she does a very poor job of teaching an intro CS course. Will take off many points on homework assignments even when the code runs correctly just because its not written exactly the way she wants it. Dont take her if there is another professor teaching the same class.,0
"Miller is an extremely tough teacher. I mean this in the nicest way possible, but his voice is extremely hard to tolerate. Your final grade is composed of 4 exams that are not similar to the ridiculous amount of optional homework that he assigns.  He's also not helpful when asked questions. Our class always went over by 15 mins. Do not recommend.",0
I grew to hate this class. She is inconsistent and extremely unhelpful. I was convinced she made things up to dislike about people's work. And the final took me three days to complete.,0
"One of the absolute best professors I ever had. Runs rings around the ""tenured"" faculty. Professor Solari knows his subject matter, is able to engage students and makes the material very interesting. I learned a lot that changed my view of things from when I came into the class. You need to do the reading to get the most out of the class.",1
Professor Sala acts more like an entertainer than a teacher. Engaging lectures but little learning. He also quite political and promotes a pretty extreme view on neoliberalism.,0
"Best Professor i have taken so far. Weekly zoom class meetings, weekly pre-class work and article reviews. Pre-quiz before class and post quiz after class. Do your work dont wait last minute. 2 exams a tad bit difficult.",1
"Professor Perkins lacks in the area of professionalism. I have never been so offended by an educator. She constantly berades her minority students and passes it off as having a "" unique and hands-on"" teaching style. There also have been several instances where I have feared for my personal safety under her leadership.",0
"Doesn't understand basics of computers, simple definitions of words like peripherals and the difference between the binary system and its units. Will grade you wrong based on her incorrect logic, and when you try to correct her, she will not admit wrong-doing, no matter what proof you present. ",0
If you want to learn accounting principals throughly take her class. One of the best professors at Westfield in my opinion. She is definitely the reason accounting is my concentration.,1
"TAKE THIS CLASS! Dr. Lee is fantastic, his lectures are engaging and he applies real-life scenarios to examples to make them easier to understand. His tests are fair, pay attention and read the notes and you'll do well.",1
Took for the online class. Exams are very hard unless you spend A LOT of time reviewing the readings and videos. There is a big group project which was not horrible but that scale of a project should not be given in an online class. Johnson is a very nice and respectful guy but the online class was not implemented very well.,1
"Boring. Boring. Boring. I'm sure he's a nice guy, but he never stops talking. I always felt like I was trapped with no way out. And, he doesn't grade most of the exams and hw turned in till the very end of the semester so you have no idea how you're doing. Can't say I learned much either... too boring to pay any attention.",0
"As long as you show up, do your homework, and pay attention, you'll be good to go. He's extremely interesting, so it's really a great class. Try to get him if you can!",1
"Great class! You should read before coming to class but only take notes from the class lecture. Everything on the test will be given in the lecture (he even cites which date on his test answer keys). There are five exams, he takes the top 4. Half the class gets C or below. Easy course to comprehend, hard to do well in because of grade distribution.",1
"He is a funny guy, but his lectures are unclear, and difficult to follow. When I sat down to do the homework, I mostly had to use peer tutors and video tutorials to learn the content. His tests aren't too terrible, but overall, I would recommend avoiding Elaydi if you can. Half the people in my section dropped after the second final.",0
You have to admire her for her patience; having never taken Spanish before I was hesitant when she put me on the spot in class. She did a great job in working with me in reach an answer. At times I mispronounced easy spanish words and each time she skillfully hinted to the right answer allowing me to say them correctly and sparing me embarrassment.,1
Professor Brown is a nice guy outside of class. In class he is very into himself and thinks his opinion is the only opinion. He expects you to know what he is talking about at all times even if you've never learned about it. He is an extremely hard grader. Lots of quizzes and if you aren't there for one you can fail the class. Dont take this class.,0
Amazing teacher! eassy to understand. when she gives a lecture you defently understand the material!,1
"If you ever wanted to take a class from Harry Potter's Mad-eye moody, this is your professor.  He'll pick on you, tell you stories, get off topic, and finally give you a pretty easy test, but you learn a lot more about law enforcement than is in the book.",1
"She was AWFUL. i learned absolutely nothing, she wore the same 2 dresses every week and on top of that, you pretty much have to show up bc iclicker is such a huge part of your grade",0
I though Terri was a very caring and considerate instructor. If you had any problems with canvas or not understanding homework questions she was available and approachable. We used an e-book text book which came with great study tools. She is understanding and has a passion for education. Put in the work and you will get good marks.,1
There is a lot of homework in this class. I don't like that we learn most of this stuff on the computer then he teaches it afterwords. The thing I don't like is the test heavy part of the course.,0
Worst professor I've had. Nothing he teaches in class is on the exams. He always has to curve the exam like 12% and we all still get Cs and Ds WITH with curve. Apparently he used to be good but doesn't care anymore. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS.,0
"The lectures are equation based. The equations are not well explained making the class material very hard to understand. There is not clarification of the material. There is a lack of help for those who do not understand the material. The class is about how the atmosphere works, but he does not believe in climate change.",0
Rick is a nice guy and is super smart. He worked for the fed for a long time so he has a ton of experience in the field. His teaching is hard to follow though. He expects you to have the chapter read before you come to class but then talks about completely different material. Then he tests on material that we've never covered. Lectures are boring.,0
"The class itself is challenging, but doable if you put the work in. He is a very smart man but it is hard to understand his lectures through a virtual setting (he uses MS Paint during lectures). Regardless of what professor you get, going to TA office hours and watching youtube videos from Quatern10n (A former 3181 TA) are your best bet to pass.",0
"I took Calc 1 in high school, and because of this Barry's class was very easy. Fair amount of homework, and lectures get boring but it's math...how exciting can you get. His dry humor is funny but he is not very helpful in office hours. I recommend you don't take him if you have never had calc. if you have, it's a straight review and easy A.",1
"Okay, I'll admit BIO 201 wasn't all that hard especially if you choose to take it with Shortridge. I had lecture for 80 minutes twice a week, and I have to say I was glad bc the lectures were WAY too long. He tends to go off on tangents, but is really there to help you get a good grade. So go ask him questions about exams! Take him to get an A. ",1
Very unkind.  Subjectively critical.  Hated her.,0
"Knows the material well but is bad at presenting it and fails to make students feel welcome or smart enough to contribute. Lots of reading, but the readings aren't too dense themselves. The material is ok, but the professor himself isn't great.",0
"Ms. Donham is a knowledgable teacher. Shes fairly clear in class of what to do and she basically walks you through all of the programming homework. Also, she lets you use notes on the test. Its an easy A.",1
"Very hard, her first language is Spanish so she seems to think its easy.",0
not so great teacher.,0
"If this is your only class for the year, then yea sure take it.",0
I really smile when I remember Mr. Ramachandran. Took ENGR 233 in the summer with him. He made it so easy for us. Tested us on exactly what he taught in class. No surprises what so ever. Easy mid terms easy finals that test your knowledge but without being cruel. I highly highly suggest taking  engr 233 in the summer with him.,1
"I had him for Medieval English Lit and while I hated the material, the class itself wasn't that hard. I thought it was okay to not read before the midterm and got a C on that. But he does let you re-do the papers and I ended up with a B+ in the course. He's a good professor, although a bit scattered.",1
"I took him for Biodiversity of the Caribbean and he is a very caring and sweet professor. The class is graded only by 3 midterms and a final, but one exam gets dropped and each test has 8 points added automatically. It is very easy to pass if you study the lectures and come to class to do the clickers. He gives a lot of extra credit!",1
Nice guy but absolutely terrible English. Hard quizzes weekly. Main problem was not being able to understand the man. He can also barely understand you.,0
"I honestly don't really mind her class, you do use the books that she tell you to get so I would get them. Some of the lectures are kind of a snore, but the projects aren't too bad and don't really require a lot of work. She also is good at feedback and if you need help she's ready to give it. Just get decent sleep before class.",1
Gives a daily quiz almost every class which is one question that she basically gives you the answer for. Only grades the first 15 so anything after that is extra credit. Assigns few out of class assignments and those are extra credit. Essentially come to class and pay attention and you'll pass with flying colors. Does grade participation points. ,1
"If you do have to take chem class, take Dr. Borglin's class. Super patient with her students. She wants her students to pass thats why she will also work hard for you. She will listen when you have questions no matter what your question is. She will completely guide you. One of the best profs in CCC.",1
Horrible. Cannot defend reasoning behind her grading.,0
"You have three books and lectures to read each week, averaging at about 140 pages per. Then you have a 30 question quiz, often with paragraph long questions. Then you have pages long ""discussion"" board topics to write weekly and bi-weekly journals. All the while you need be working on your 40-50 pages term paper. This class is busy work.",0
"Professor Willoughby is the best teacher I have had at UCSD. Professor Willoughby has a wealth of knowledge that you rarely see. People who hate his class structure are lazy students who want everything handed to them. Professor Willoughby makes you take your own notes on lecture, which is not a big deal and his quizzes are easy and straightforward",1
"Stewart is so hilarious, he has a really dry sense of humor that made an otherwise dull subject matter pretty engaging. I wouldn't advise skipping class, as you'd get behind quickly. I would say that he doesn't give that much feedback on essays, which can be frustrating if you want to improve between draft & final. Very sharp guy.",1
"Arevelo is a terrible teacher. She has a very heavy accent which makes it difficult to understand her lecture, as well as making it easy to loose focus and interest. If you have to miss an exam the only time you can make it up is 2 days before the final(she will not budge with this even if you have a good reason). Test are very hard. DO NOT TAKE!",0
"Charles is a down-to-Earth professor. He knows the subject matter very well and explains it in very informative terms. The only problems with JUST 401 is that his lectures are somewhat boring, attendance is mandatory, and the slides aren't posted online for review. The 2 quizzes are pretty easy if you read through the homework the night before.",1
"He is slightly enjoyable and lively speaker in class. In an individual level he is very harsh though, and is not at all willing to answer questions or help. You miss more than 4 classes, you fail. No exceptions.",0
"The grading policy is very lenient. I ended up with an A, but to be honest came away not really understanding physics. It seems like it's mostly equations being put on a board, with not enough attempt at helping students to really understand the material. Retakes on every quiz though, and participation counts for 20% of your grade.",1
She only allows 3 absences. If you're on your phone or daydreaming she counts you absent. She is super hard grading on papers. You have to read short stories and take quizzes on them on very specific things from the story. She barely smiles and is very monotone. I would not recommend taking this teacher.,0
This class should not be as difficult as it was. Very hard exams and a TON of busy work. You do a group project where everyone gets the same grade (even though I was stuck with a group where i did EVERYTHING). I'm sure she means well but she can never admit when she is wrong.,0
she is not very helpful. She will critize everything you do.,0
"Good teacher, enjoyed his class.",1
"layoun is an interesting person if you have a personal conversation with her, but her lectures are fairly useless. she takes attendance on random days(15% of your grade), so be sure to go. all you need to do is go to lecture and discussion, do the essays, and read all the books EXCEPT for the non-fiction ones, which you never need to account for!",1
Has it our for students. Obviously worse teacher,0
"to be honest, although I re-watch his recordings, I still don't understand his English at all for both lectures and questions on exams, so I don't learn anything useful from this class. The good thing is he is an easy marker and his exams aren't hard (due to open book). Unfortunately, he is the only person who teaches 4115, 3225, 3235, KPU IT sucks",0
Hard grader (very hard to get a A on anything). Teaching style is very dry and makes it hard to keep focus and learn from lectures. Troys to cram too much information into such a small amount of time.,0
Great Instructor-  cares teaches and gives a little humor.  Real life experiences used to teach the class- probably can out cook some of the other prof/chefs,1
"Useless class, just a waste of time.",0
"Attendance is not mandatory, but he will use the fact that you are not in class against you. Along with this, he gives quizzes every week. He does not actually teach you how to do problems, just throws a bunch of equations at you and expects you to know how to use them to solve a problem when he has not shown you.",0
"Her tests, at least one question each I had a complete blank, and she lets you bring in notes and glossary. TOUGH tests. Also, you have to actually read the entire book but its really interesting, for me at least. Pretty big final paper, 10 p. min. could be worse. but PLENTY of extra credit, enough she says has carried ppl to an A",1
"Would HIGHLY advice that you take someone else. lectures were long, boring, repetitive,  and did not show some techniques to work on our writing. the grading on papers where heavily graded. he did let you rewrite the papers but it was only for ten ten extra points. if you need more English classes  for your major would suggest you go look elsewhere",0
"she was an okay professor. I really liked that she was always there to help out when I needed it and gave good feedback. You have to really work for a good grade though, but if you ask for help and do what you're suppose to you can end with the grade you want.  Im not 100% sure if i would take this professor again.",1
"She made me hate history. The class is a just meandering discussion about class and gender that goes in circles. There is no guidance whatsoever. Also, you basically have to say that women played a larger role in basically any major historical event that has ever happened than is often thought. Just awful.",0
"She is very nice and grades fairly. There are a lot of papers, but nothing too difficult.",1
She's bomb!,1
She is an amazing prof!! She is so energetic and passionate about teaching!,1
"Scott is such an amazing professor! He is the best looking professor at the college. He definitely knows his stuff, cares about the students, and he is super understanding! Take as many of his classes as you can because he is amazing!",1
"This is the nicest man ever. He gets to know his students and genuinely cares about their success. His lectures are very engaging, but it is still beneficial to read the textbook and do the optional homework he assigns.",1
The main theme of his course is that everything is a social construct. The topics for the assignments are about who is allowed to play hip hop.,0
He's not very accessible outside class and he's not very good with technology which was especially bad because I took his class online. He also fails to communicate clearly both in lectures and with just information like when tests are or how the class is going to work.,0
He is by far the worst History teacher I have ever had. His grading scale makes no sense at all. He will grade your assignments on literature and grammatical errors instead of the history. I felt like I was in English 101. Never taking him again.,0
"Avoid this professor. Grading criteria is unclear and arbitrary and he demands specific things not defined on his rubrics, and will dock grades for no reason. Lectures are lengthy, rambling, and largely uninformative. Assignment parameters are ambiguous and deliberately vague. Test & quiz questions are poorly worded and on occasion flat out wrong.",0
"Love her. This is an easy Oral Comm. credit. Take the class if only to listen to her speak - oh, Garneau's voice. It's wonderful. She's a good prof, and her knowledge base is very deep in the general European language area. She is also a character, and has a great way of incorporating real life into what could be a monotonous class.",1
"Dr. Vutha is a professor that genuinely cares about each and every one of his students, and wants everyone to succeed. His lectures are very easy to understand, and he is a very clever and witty person. I would absolutely recommend him for this class.",1
"Don is excellent! He lectures mostly on the historical and cultural contexts of the texts in question, which I found enlightening. He has a great sense of humour and keeps class engaging and interesting. He's also very fair - not excessive in his demands, and extremely helpful if you need guidance on anything. Best professor I had this semester.",1
This man is awesome!! It's pretty easy to get a good grade in his class...just take ALOT of notes and do the work.,1
"Solid prof. If you did well in MAT223, MAT224 wouldn't be extremely hard as some people said. He explained everything well and the level of difficulty of the tests were reasonable based on your quiz and homework.",1
He is SO EXCELLENT - awesome Professor! One of the very best Professors I've ever taken!!! Best in the Dept.,1
this prof is really smart and knows his knowledge. he gives interesting lectures. his exam review is very clear and it is easy to get a good grade if you pay attention.,1
"Rude, inpatient, unhelpful, and cryptic.",0
by far one of the most cutest professors in ece. I would only go to morning classes to see her teach. Got a terrible mark in the course tho but I would take again if she's teaching it and will pay attention this time,1
horrible teacher! very rude. does not care about his student and is un-willingly to help his student understand class material. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASSES! i have never had such a rude teacher in my life!!!!!,0
"Flies through the info. Talks about random stuff and makes weird comparisons. Definitely knows his stuff, super smart. If you enjoy chemistry and have a knack for it, then Krumpe will probably be a great teacher for you. I have a hard time with Chem and felt that he moved very quickly, you will spend a lot of time outside of class working.",0
"His questions for the lab are unclear and you can interpret his questions in many ways, if you were lucky to interpret them his way, then you're good. He's also not really nice, sometimes he gets frustrated when we ask him questions. I decided not to attend his classes because he just vibrates negative energy, so I would try to solo my labs.",0
"Explains the material very well, and gives very little in the way of assignments. Easily the best SAGES I took at Case.",1
"Totally ruined what I already knew about integral calculus. His tests are so much harder than the homework and practice tests/problems. Very often late to class, even on test days. Released exam grades 30 minutes after the class-drop deadline. Worst class I've taken.",0
"Go to Lecture! His assignments are very broad and unclear. Other than that, his midterm and final are open notes (though it didn't help much).",0
"Professor Lipson is obviously a very knowledgeable person, but his soothing voice and his tangential lecture style makes it hard for me to stay engaged in the class. Ive learnt a lot from this professor from the first half of the semester, but as the semester progressed I felt he was pushing many claims without a strong base of evidence.",0
"Dr. Johnson is my favorite professor of all time. I've never met someone so passionate and knowledgeable about anything. I can honestly say he is the smartest man I have ever met in my entire life. He will make you work hard for a decent grade. As long as you show up to lectures and put forth an honest effort, you'll be alright.",1
"Stated he would not tests would be ""applied"" and have no silly memorization of lists.  Tested pretty much the exact opposite.",0
"Cool professor, challenging but engaging. Put in your best effort and study for her tests (especially that first one) and you should have a good time.",1
"Highly do not recommend this class. She makes a syllabus but by the third week, we were way off schedule, and no revised syllabus was provided. She is so incredibly rude and hateful. Makes you feel like an idiot for asking questions. This is a freshman level class, but will NOT boost your GPA. Don't take unless you're already familiar with theatre.",0
"WORST teacher I have ever taken. Very rude, and super unclear. Half of the class time would be spent would be spent going completely off topic and talking about her personal experiences (interesting but NOT related to anatomy or things to help us study). Never learned anything from lecture. Tests are timed and have 5 chapters per test. DONT TAKE IT",0
"Does not teach. Goes on tangets related to his political agenda. He does not walk through problems, better off reading the text yourself and not attending class.",0
"great prof 
 quizes are easy 
 just watch the final exam
 :)",1
"Avoid this guy..Worst teacher I have ever had the misfortune of taking a course from. Like the others have said, BE PREPARED TO TEACH YOURSELF! He hardly ever lectures and when he does they hard to follow and boring. He has the students do the homework prior to class and then has the students provide the answers. This guy is in it for the paycheck.",0
"Well, don't sign up for one of her classes if you're not ready to work. It's common for me to spend at least 4 hours on one of her homework assignments. That said, she explains material really well. Challenges you enough to actually learn. Engaging. High expectations. Good sense of humor. Be an active participant in class or she'll crack down.",1
Sydney is funny so class goes by fast. I learned more about writing in this class than all of high school. She even helped me write a letter to petition for financial aid. Love her!,1
"Great professor, very funny! easy class for physiology. Quiz every week but he will review for it and tell you what you need to know for quiz, 1 easy paper 4-5 pages. Mid term and Final questions come from weekly quizes, take him!",1
"By far the rudest and uncaring professors I've ever had at JMU. He will make fun of students for asking ""dumb"" questions and always comes off as angry. If the class doesn't know something he'll call them incompetent and refuse to teach it. Tests are VERY difficult and require a lot of studying.",0
Tom is the best Whitman has to offer; don't miss taking a class with him,1
"Best prof I've had so far in the Journalism department. Knowledgeable and as long as you pay attention you will do fine. Funny guy, love Bob Dylan.",1
SHE'S AMAZING I LOVE HER. :),1
"Alex was one of my favorite professors! His lectures are very clear and pretty engaging- you can tell he has a real passion for astronomy and it makes the class more enjoyable! The midterms and quizzes aren't easy, but if you put in decent effort and do the weekly homework you will be in good shape! You will really learn a lot in this class!",1
Definitely a little confused and often relies on the students to help him figure out assignments. He does care though and wants his students to pass. He heavily curved the final exam. His quizzes aren't easy and the format changes every week so just do your best. Lab reports are easy but make sure your sig figs are right!,0
Jim Tam is incredibly uncaring and unclear in his lectures. He relies heavily on irrelevant stories and goes on tangents.,0
"Has an accent but it is not hard to understand. Homework is assigned every week & you have 1 week to do it. His test are similar to the review handouts he places on his website, but do not ONLY use those to study, refer back to the HW too. HW is all on the interweb. After the first exam, things get a lot harder. Try to take a different professor.",0
His class is extremely hard to pass. Dont take him if math126 is your last math class.,1
Dr. Russ is an excellent professor. Lectures are engaging and filled with interesting historical facts. You can tell he has read nearly everything with regard American history and presents material in a storybook-like manner. Teaches Delaware History in an insightful way with a clear enthusiasm for the state. 2 exams and 1 term paper. Awesome.,1
"Hope you like waiting hours on end for a reply back via email or message. Also, this is  the only online instructor who I have taken that has exams open at a certain time and terminate 10 min after. Missed the 10 min window? Too bad, no make-ups!",0
"Athar is a great guy, but terrible teacher. I don't want to be mean, but his accent is very hard to understand. He just hands out packets in class and expects you to teach yourself. He answers questions, but doesn't explain answers. His reviews for the exams are also lackluster.",0
"I rated Dr. Luther a 5 on everything because he is truly the best professor I have ever known.  He is not easy in the sense that you don't have to show up or study and you can still ace the class.  However, he is easy in the sense that if you are a diligen",1
"Truly a great professor. Lets you rewrite papers and is very humorous. If you're ever confused about anything, he's there to help and he's very understanding. His assignments are not a walk in the park but if you pay attention and read you should be fine. I wish I had chosen him for 1A",1
"complete and utter fail. Never hated a class so much. This was one i absolutely was looking forward to, so i can get into research but i feel as if i learned nothing at all. do not recommend him for THIS class. favorites much?",0
Pick someone else for English. Lectures make no sense,0
He's a fantastic professor,1
"I did Global First, so I took Professor Levenson's class in London. It was a great experience, and much of the class involved taking field trips and discussing plays we saw. He was very engaging, and discussions were always interesting.",1
One of the hardest classes I have ever taken. As a non major I made a huge mistake by being in this class. She's very nice and interesting but to a non major her long answer tests are impossible. I studied for 20 hours and had no hope in heck of passing.,0
Very good Profesor,1
"Best online instructor at Grossmont College, highly recommended by counselors.",1
"Everyone complains way more than they should. He may drone on but it's about important stuff you need to know. His instructions are NOT super vague, he has a 15 page document with every assignment and how you need to do them. Follow that and get all As. Page length doesn't matter, just say what you feel and show your knowledge, you'll be fine.",1
"This class was very time consuming.  However, if you want to learn Spanish grammar then this is your teacher.  Very helpful, extremely knowledgeable.",1
Please skip this class if possible. There is absolutely no communication or organization throughout the quarter. The poor TAs were always struggling to catch up with the professor and I never knew what was going on. The lectures and exams are extremely intense. He's very passionate but not the best professor for an intro class.,0
"If you are considering a course with Prof Katz, I HIGHLY advise you to read my review before enrolling.  Katz is a major idiot who just stands in front of the class looking down at his ugly self and the floor for the entire hour.  You learn nothing and are bound to fail because he hates all students.  Major pass here.  Pure cock",0
"I took 4 years of spanish in high school, and his class is extremely easy. sometimes it is difficult to understand his accent, but he is very helpful with the material. prepares you for the exams very well(98% on midterm), grades more easily on tests the more you participate in class.",1
"I thought she was fair and you got the grade with what you put into it. The project is important. Easy to understand course. You do have to understand the syllabus though well and don't turn in the assignments late. There is a lot of reading, she does have videos posted for the first five chapters of the course.",1
"Dr Hynie is the BEST prof I have had in my undergrad! She does an amazing amazing job at guiding students with their thesis. Her expectations are crystal clear unlike many other profs. She goes above and beyond for her students, and is always accessible! I have learned so much from her and had a blast in the 2 courses she's taught! Highly recommend",1
"I had the opportunity to take Dr Kelly's Finance course my last year of college. I loved it, and it is one of the biggest reasons I am able to navigate the investment world with a passion and drive for success. I retired at age 43, not solely because of his class, but it sure made me more confident in my decisions. Thanks Dr. Kelly !",1
"Shef is the man. Clear study guides for midterm and final which reflect each other. gives you a chance to argue your own participation grade. lots of reading and writing, but so are all UNF history classes at this level. Tough grader on the paper, but very fair all around. 2 5 page papers that both require you to read 3 books each (yes, read)",1
"I like her but not as a teacher. She doesn't mind you coming by her office hours and she's helpful. Apparently 070 has a strict rubric and she has a lot to get through in one class. Makes you feel dumb for asking questions... but rushes through content. You have to come to class, textbook she'll project so just get the book HW out of it, thats all",1
"I took Cowdin for a University Seminar but I hope to be able to take one of my religion courses with him. He makes the material very interesting and genuinely wants you to do well in the class, There is homework every night but its just graded on participation. A couple essays and a group presentation which weren't too hard.",1
"All the quizzes & tests are online and he gives you NO access at all to them to study for the tests/exams. There is no book, so this really limits studying. He is really hard to understand his accent is STRONG. He is very limited help in his office. He also gives quizzes almost every class that are pretty hard.",0
"Ron Leprohon is an amazing professor who cares about how you feel as a student. He is super clear, caring and helpful. Attendance is mandatory for tutorials not for classes however, he makes classes really interesting so I'd recommend you to go.",1
"She knows her material, but has poor delivery and is unreceptive to students",0
"Make sure you do youre homework, it can save your grade especially if you arent as great as math. Brooke is an amazing professor, shes eager to help and easy to approach. Even with my struggle, having a cool professor really helps.",1
This guy is actually the worst. I am doing okay in the class but he gives no guidance to his students at all and he freaks out about stupid things like cell phones and leaving classes. Stay away from this guy if you want to enjoy your classes.,0
SO DIFFICULT and she is so rude. Made me cry when I asked for help which was only a quick question after class lol she will not talk to you past the end of class time and insists you go to her office hours.,0
"All of the lectures are in person, he does not upload any of them to the online page. There's only homework and exams. The homework has nothing to do with the exams. You can get 100% on the hw and still not pass the exams. Would not recommend to anyone really trying to learn advertising",0
The worst teacher I have ever had in my entire life. Very spacey and disorganized. DO NOT recommend!,0
Relies too heavily on automatic systems that don't give partial marks even for final exams.,0
"Absolutely fantastic at explaning things.  His lectures are incredibly well organized and easy to follow.  Assignments are tough, but well explained.",1
"Mr. Johnson was probably one of the few people in my life to make history interesting. He was able to make it more than just facts and figures, but about the lives of the people who lived it. You will have to study and know facts and figures too, but the information he taught me has stayed with me.",1
Very caring and respectable teacher. She is easy to relate to and understand. She made me understand why public speaking is an important and useful class to take. One of my favorite classes that I have ever had. She is one of the best teachers ever. Would recommend her to anyone and everyone!,1
Excellent Knowledge about security,1
"OKAY THIS PROF IS THE WORST. He just reads slides in class, slides which he neither posts on Moodle nor is gonna test you on. If you haven't done IT for a while it's gonna drain you (the first assignment was coding a webpage). Clearly a tough grader and doesn't appreciate your efforts. DO NOT RECOMMEND AT ALL trust the ratings.",0
"Instruction felt vague. I wish he assigned more homework. Second test was an awful exam. 3 questions, and despite all my studying I got a grade < 50 because 3 questions is such a small sample of knowledge.",0
Fail me although he knows my difficult situation,0
Melissa is round about amazing. She understand us students got stuff to do outside of class and gives us time to do projects. Sold 10/10.,1
"AVOID THIS MAN ESPECIALLY IF YOURE DOING ONLINE! I have him for 2 classes and failed miserably bc he doesnt do zoom, doesnt post assignments, and only tells you abt things 1 time. If you can take your class with a different prof do it. Also the final exam for this class was 2 essay both 1,000 words",0
"Dr. Towne is a very good professor, however some times his lectures are hard to follow if biology is not your strong point. He is very willing to help his students to do well. I went to him a lot through-out the semester and he helped me so much. ",1
"Get ready to teach yourself. She gets off topic ALOT and does NOT teach what will be on exams. The only hope you will have to pass is to go to SI sessions. The SI leader will teach more than Walling. She treats the class like kids, ex: congratulates us over knowing what H2O is and such. She is very nice, just not great at teaching.",0
Lectures are nothing more than inane ramblings. The tests were easy enough if you read. I would recommend finding somebody else. It's really just the lectures were so impressively terrible and I'm even into history.,0
"He is a great history scholor, I learn a lot from his class.  I am found of him and would like to be a scholor like him.",1
"He would be 5 minutes late a lot. He was nice but the class was a little confusing. Still, it was easy. You have to pay attention to him in class but he gave a review sheet. He told a lot of dad jokes. Kind of funny.",1
very tough grader,0
"This class has been the hardest class I have taken so far at Mott. IT wasn't exactly what I expected it to be, but you can tell that he loves the subject he is teaching and that makes a big difference. Be sure to study and though he says it isn't required, it would be beneficial to read the chapters suggested in the book.",1
Doesn't take attendance but tests are all based off in-class notes; and they're pretty hard. One easy group project. Uses a really annoying voice to drill in material and forces his opinions about the world and religion on you. The class average was probably a C.,0
"She is extremely clear about what she expects from you. I took this class online and she has been nothing but helpful. She responds to e-mails extremely quickly and knows what she is doing. She is also very knowledgeable about the subject. Honestly, I admire the her. Just do the work and you can use the book on tests.",1
"She quizzes almost every class based on the reading. Plus, she also requires you to post twice each week based on your reading. Miss a post, and major points get deducted! Read and set an alarm to post. Papers arent to bad. Exams are bad, for example, gives 150 terms to study and only tests on 25 of them. Her teaching style was not the easy",0
"I love this professor. He is the best professor I've ever met in US, very patient and respects students. He is willing to spend 1 whole hour to discuss your problem during the office time. Even though there are lots of homeworks, you can easily get the idea from his slides, which is very clear. No textbook, everything is from the slide. Hydrology.",1
"Also took 195, 236, 374. This is my favorite professor at UNC. He is one of the smartest individuals you will ever come across and he is extremely fun to learn from. He is a hard grader but as long as you prove your points, he will love what you write. I recommend this teacher to every student on the face of the planet.",1
"He conducts his class with the perfect online protocol.  He provides thorough instructions, video presentations, power points, notes, reading assignments - EVERYTHING - all prepared just waiting for you to apply yourself.  Rapid grading, valuable feedback - just the perfect professor for learning programming and Visual Studio in an online setting.",1
"Professor Saldivar is a good person, but a horrible professor for average students. He skipped the review chapter (fine). He also skipped the second chapter so we ""know Calc is a hard class"". He jumped straight into derivatives without any explanation of a tangent line. No calculators were allowed. We were quizzed every single day. Don't take him.",0
"Professor Braker is hilarious and truly bonds with all of her students by the end of the semester. The class however, is disorganized. She takes forever to grade assignments and tests and will sometimes lose the assignments we were supposed to complete. Overall, she is an amazing teacher for anybody looking to fulfill their bio requirement.",1
She is hot hot hot,1
Very funny professor. He is very knowledgable and the notes he makes are very aesthetic. The notes themselves make you want to be good at calculus. The extra revision sessions are a great asset. Never leaves you hanging. Answers all questions in lectures even if youre interrupting the flow,1
"Class is a little boring, but he's an awesome professor!",1
"Dr. D is a great guy who definitely knows what he's talking about. Pay attention and take a lot of notes and you'll probably get a B. His class is one of the hardest classes on campus, but very interesting nonetheless. Great guy once you get to know him, sucking up always helps. It's hard to get an A, but even harder to fail.  ",1
"He's a very approachable professor, though that being said, the content in this course basically nullifies all that. Unless your thing is EARLY British history (think back to the Saxons, Normans, etc.) stay away from this course. WAY TOO MUCH READING.",1
"Easy course but she's picky. Her t/f questions, it's like she tries to throw u off on purpose. She'll say one thing and say another...blah...go every other day but no need to go all the time...",0
"tests are hard as you could imagine. you have to memorize different theories that are almost impossible. homework every week but very very easy. but like i said, if you dont like studying, do not take her because her tests are extremley difficult",0
"Gives good instruction, really helpful hints and critique, and fosters a positive environment.  Is respectful to all levels of painting skill, encourages deeper thought. Would like her to accomodate students whose focus isn't painting (i.e. don't require so many expensive supplies, spend so much time on non-basic info.",1
"For MTH 207, there's 3 quizzes a week, so don't plan on skipping. Also, he doesn't explain things very clearly and he'll work through the easy problems, but leave the hard problems for you to do. Dr. Eager does make you feel dumb if you ask questions at times and he's not always around when his office hours are suppose to be. Wouldn't recommend him",0
"Awesome, no book required unless you need it to help gets information you may have missed from class due to lack of attendence.  I never enjoyed history...I  enjoyed his class and finally learned some history.",1
each time I ask him about the class work. His attitude was so mean. I will not take any of his class again.,0
We had read short stories and had class discussions. We had 8 online journals that were spread out throughout the entire semester  and 3 papers. I would recommend anyone who struggles in English to take this class. She is always available and willing to help. I was in borderline A/B and I received an A but class participation will help.,1
do not take with him if you have not taken 115.. he is not willing to help you at all even though it's not a required prereq.  He is very arrogant and I dreaded going to his class every day because of his condescending attitude.,0
"Objectively not the best teacher, but far from the worst. I found her easy to get along with and decently clear at communicating why I received the grade I did.",1
Theresa is awful. She waits till last minute for everything. You could go above and beyond trying to get a decent grade in the class and she would not notice nor would she care. She seems off in her own world and cannot seem to handle the large classes she takes on. She grades harshly and never provides an explanation for such grades. Avoid!!!,0
"wow... this class is rediculous... homework everyday and if you dont do it, you will fail.  do not take this class if you dont like to speak up in class.. you have a huge project due at the end of class and you have to do it infront of 200 people...so if that scares you, id suggest you taking another class",1
"Fear Death, taxes and Professor Pirouz. This guy is worse than Ferris Bueller's monotonic speaking teacher. He can put Grim Ripper to sleep. Angel of Death will run away from him out of boredom. However, outside classroom, he seems funny and quite sociable. He has a nice smile but a bad combover.",0
A very very tough grader!,0
He's really sweet and wants to make sure his students pass. He was willing to hold extra office hours on Saturdays the week of an exam. However it was really hard to understand him because of his heavy accent. It's hard to get what he's saying the in class so I recommend recording his lectures and listening to them when studying.,1
"Dr. Raja's class isn't that hard, but be prepared to be talked down to a lot...I just kept my head down and surfed the back row.  Not a lot of busy work outside of class at least.  You can pull off a B in her class relatively easily if you just study a bit and show up, but I found her sense of humor and attitude toward students really irritating.",0
"He is the worst teacher I have ever had. He is so old and set in his ways it is ridiculous. I understand being discipline and being firm, but being too hard is simply not necessary. I hated his class from the time I went in there to right now. He gives you pointless assignments. Personally I dont think he should be teaching anymore. He has no kind ",0
"This prof literally saved me! She wants you to do well, she wants you to learn and she will give you every resource to do just that!!!!",1
"Furno is absolutely fabulous, relates subject matter to real events that occurred in his personal life. Textbook is required but didnt cost an arm and leg due to using an older version.",1
"The class is pretty boring and her notes are pretty scattered as she draws hundreds of web diagrams on the board, and tries to connect ideas.  I wouldn't recommend this class or the professor.",0
Dr. Wood is an amazing instructor! Not sure what the other person was thinking below. He challenges you to do your best. He is very helpful if you make the time to meet with him. He pushes students to be their best. I have nothing but respect for him.  He will challenge you. The courses are difficult. But in a very good way!,0
"She expects you to participate in discussions every class, one comment isn't enough. She's nice and actually wants you to do well but can be really intimidating. The midterm and finals are pretty straight forward though and the material is interesting. Too much reading though. She teaches well and goes through most of it. Never emails back though.",1
"Funny man, yet for geo100 you will be bored completely and he makes you do a group presentation that is a waste of time and dependent on other group members. Overall an easy class but irritating.",1
"she's a lunatic, whatever you do, DONT take her class. She's more uptight than a high school teacher. Counts 2 tardies as an absence and 2 absences and she will drop you from the course. Also, she is the LEAST understanding professor I have ever met, she went over on class time every class and made multiple students late to their next class",0
"She's a great teacher, took her in 5 week class and all went very well.  Lots of homework, tests were challenging but fair, lectures very engaging with good clarity.  Highly recommend her...",1
"If I could give him more than 5 stars, I would. He actually made this class enjoyable, and I truly liked learning throughout this class. Hes extremely accommodative during this pandemic as well. Honestly, just do all your work, have the textbook with you during tests, follow the rubric of the discussion posts, and you will pass.",1
"Lots of information in lectures, tests mostly on lectures, go to class! If you miss class, make sure you catch up. Overall a great prof.",1
"EASY class, super boring, I have never NOT liked a professor.. so me not liking her says a lot. Shes way outdated. Midterms are easy",0
"She's a nice person, but assigns insane amounts of reading. If you don't do it, you don't get points for journals. THEY ADD UP FAST. If you like standing up and talking you can get extra credit, otherwise you're out of luck. She'll give you a horrible grade on a paper and not provide much explanation when you approach her. Don't take this class.",0
"He's honestly the worst professor at SDSU and teaches such an important subject too, please take the class at CC if you want to learn.",0
complete dick.....midterm and final were way off track....completely useless prof,0
"I had this professor in 1994.  I now teach college, and I chair the Communications department at my school.  Does that make me worthy to comment?  No.  Did this professor easily push the slackers aside to focus on those who obviously wanted to learn?  Yes.  I admire the man.  Yes, he's challenging.",1
She is a tough grader and also she is very strict with spellings. If you misspell a word she would take your grades off,0
he has the best teaching method ever and makes everything so interesting. he makes it fun so u actually want to go to class all the time.,1
She is angry and disrespectful. She is the worst teacher at LAGCC. DON'T TAKE HER IF YOU DO YOU ARE GOING TO REGRET IT.,0
"AMAZING product, would buy again. I recommend this to all my friends.",1
"Requires you to purchase TopHat in addition to the already expensive book and MyEconLab access just so he can take attendance. He teaches well enough, but moves too quickly through material and his handwriting is borderline illegible. Definitely buy the book, preferably physical copy, because it will do a way better job than him of teaching you.",0
"Not very good, teaches simple stuff but then quizes stuff she doesn't go over in class.",0
"Ms. Gulick is quite possibly the worst Mathematics professor I've ever had the misfortune of being 'lectured' by.   She isn't clear with her examples, she deducts points for the most ridiculous reasons, and she takes pride in watching her students suffer.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!",0
"He is an amazing Prof. Fun, Energetic Helpful, Enthusiastic.. If I find he teaches something else I am definetly going to take it!!! I would recommdend this prof. to anyone. He will help you one on one if you need to. His theme for the class this year was violence! It is my most interesting class!!",1
"He is easy. You will pass, but he is EXTREMELY rude. If you are in the class to actually learn, forget it. He will tell you the answer and if you ask why, he will say don't worry about it. If you just want to pass with an A or B, take his class. If you actually want to learn, don't.",0
"Chuck is an amazing instructor who constantly pushes you to be a better writer. While his assignments are very time consuming, the knowledge of writing that you will gain is invaluable. Focus on his feedback throughout the semester and continue to refine and you will get a good grade!",1
not helpful person and tough grader,0
"As a person, Hoffman is the best guy out there, but as a professor he is just extremely hard. Lectures are easy to understand, but his exams are no where close to his practice problems. No extra credit, no homework points. He solely grades you on your exam grades. 6 exams in total and your grade is based on total points you receive.",0
"I think its very interesting that a lot of people are complaining about grades. I did everything I needed to do and got the A, so I wonder why people are so unhappy. Maybe they just didn't do as well as they thought they were going to do. Either way, she is great and I recommend her. Just don't expect to get by without putting in the work.",1
"Professor Kim's online class was a bit rough for the newly transitioned course to be online. It was a bit unorganized, but the overall lectures and assignments were conveyed well. I recommend participating in discussions to further understand the countless reading that you will be doing! The course was not necessarily hard, but definitely keep up!",1
"Intelligent and extremely pleasant professor who seems to truly want you to do well. The class was easy as long as you study the online quizzes AND the questions in the study guide that she herself published. Lectures can be a little boring, but that also depends on how engaged you and your classmates are. I highly recommend her.",1
"Story and Structure. I didn't like her much for this class. I felt like I didn't really learn anything. She was very unhelpful when I was having issues with a paper and told me it wasn't going to matter much, but then I got a D on the paper and it really brought down my grade.",0
"I love having him! He's always very chill. His assignments aren't worth a lot individually and are usually pretty straight forward, but they add up! Make sure to keep up with them. Very easy to get an excellent grade in his class. He reminds me of a teddy bear too lol but that's beyond the point. Would recommend!",1
very good instructor. do your work and you will do great in her class.,1
"Graham is a really nice guy and you can tell he actually wants to be there. The class mainly consisted of quizzes, 4 big exams, and the Final. The quizzes, however, were more like in class assignments, because you can work together and even ask him for help. If you miss a quiz day, you receive a 0, but he dropped the 2 lowest quiz scores.",1
"Clearly, everyone before me has had a different version of Mr. Bisiacchi. Snarky. RUDE. All of his tests are pop quizzes. His lecture are useless and boring. If it wasn't for the test that were ALWAYS at the beginning of class, I wouldn't even come. The book is MANDATORY. Essays were simple, but grades hard. Would never take this class again.",0
Class was easy. There were lots of homework and there are weekly quizzes. He does go over the same thing a lot of the time which sets back during lecture.,1
"I'm a straight A student with rarely a B. This class is horrendous. Cathey is a very nice guy and extremely educated on the subject; however, his testing versus his teaching are horribly construed. This level of Acct is still heavily a learning curve for most students, and Cathey is not the professor for this. Take ANYONE else. Seriously. ",0
Ms. Mancinelli is an inspiring person. I learned more than just dance from her classes. She improves language and interpersonal skills as well. She's a great mentor and excellent teacher. Be patient with her and always come to class on time and be prepared.,1
"This class definitely in not one of the worst but it is by far a walk-through. Her lectures are so hard to sit through. She sits in the front and is very bland, to me I don't think that she is a very good teacher. No chances for extra credit, and if you were ever going to skip a class this would be the one cuz there is no point in goin. Lect online",0
"Ive been doing great throughout the semester, but then he has had us study our two last assignments and study the answer key. The 50% midterm was based almost entirely on those two assignments. Frustrating that if i didn't understand something after doing well consistently i will suffer heavily for it.",0
"I had Karen for a CTH101 class and she gave us A LOT of homework and tests but ultimately if you take them together with your group they are fairly easy, plus she is a nice person and will answer any questions you have or help you gladly if you give her time!",1
"would not take any class by him again, he treats the class like a 400 level course. I don't care for art history and thought taking a 100 level course in it would be fine but no. He genuinely does not care that you do well and is not willing to help you with anything. I have other legit classes I had to focus on than ART HISTORY.",0
Ree is a very laid back teacher but also does everything he can to make sure you understand the material and use proper safety in the shop. A great professor and an even better match for a game of MTG. Bonus points for being easy on the eyes,1
Really not helpful. Material biased and boring. I do not reccommend the class or the teacher.,0
"Great prof!  When he teaches he is so articulate and animated that it keeps you watching.  He phrases things perfectly to understand and will always help if you need it.  His workload is very, very high and his exams are extremely tough but you will understand the material!",1
Best professor at CMU,1
"While he is very intelligent, if you are the type of learner who needs more explanation, he's not the professor you need. He explains the math problems by the book without further explanation. This course is fast paced and will not slow down for those who learn slower.",0
Ms. Hunt is an awesome teacher. She makes the class a lot easier and funny. I would take her over and over again. We need more teachers like her.,1
"Mueller spent most of the semester telling us how we can't afford to mess up our group project that he assigned us. He has high hopes for a 200 level class and holds you to standards that change with the blink of an eye. If you don't have to take this class, then don't. Spend your money on something you will actually use in your career. ",0
"She's a real cool professor if you have the opportunity to take another class with her, grab it.",1
"Worst professor I've ever had. Thick accent to the point you can't understand, and he doesn't slow down to pronuniciate his words. Makes all concepts so difficult and literally speeds through everything. Tests are 60% of the grade so you better know what you're doing. No extra credit & lots of homework only worth 10%. Take someone, ANYONE else.",0
"Great guy, has a ton of applicable real-world experience.  Very knowledgeable about pretty much all things to do with tax.  Not the quickest grader in the world but nobody's perfect.",1
"The worst professor I've ever taken. Talks about herself, and is kind of rude to students. Forgets everything, sends assignment instructions out late, but still expects them to be due on their normal due dates. Doesn't teach anything. Don't take a class with her, ever.",0
"Professor Adams gives very delayed feedback and is not good with responding to inquiries. There are unclear expectations for assignments, yet she grades harshly. Very critical. ",0
"She is a good teacher, but does like to make you work. The work is easy enough if you keep up with her.",1
"AWFUL. Looking to teach yourself differential equations? Sign up for Professor Hamilton. If not, save yourself the immense amount of stress, frustration, and anger that you will experience if you take this class with him. His notes are next to impossible to understand, offers little help when students ask questions and was VERY unfair with midterms",0
Ralph Pyle is the greatest!  I got a 3.5 and only read 1/3 of the books.  I did go to every lecture though and if you do you don't need to read.  The guy is hilarious and really laid back!!  He is very helpful too!,1
"Professor Hutton was a very tough grader, It was very hard to fix what she wanted on the rubric because she was not very specific on what she wanted she also quizzes you on what she likes. (EDU 104)",0
"He teaches very quickly and isn't the most approachable person for questions. A nice guy but can be intimidating. The lab is very straightforward, I always knew what I was doing.",0
"Prof. Ted Stephenson is the best Professor. He helped us find a job by showing us where to apply and how to apply for a job. He always makes his lecture fun and entertaining, which making everyone wanna come to class every week. He always listens to his students and give feedback. He is a fooood LOver !!!",1
"So, he's nerdy and his references/jokes are usually a bit dated, and he DOES say ""um"" a lot. But, that's where the ""bad"" stops. He makes himself available for students, answers questions, and is completely fair about grading. I never used the ""required"" textbook. Nice guy, easy class.",1
"Paul's course was easy to achieve a high grade in, but was really boring. He isn't a great lecturer and uses a lot of filler words that can make it difficult to follow his train of thought. He is disorganized and doesn't really seem to care about his teaching responsibilities. I feel I would have enhanced my skill sets better with another professor",0
"Great teacher, loves what he teaches. Likes to get students involved the entire time with debates. Very knowledgeable about information in class. Had to buy actual novels no textbooks, which makes things cheaper. Very easy to go to for help, recommend taking his class if you are willing to read a decent amount and like participating",1
Clearly loves his subject and enjoys teaching.,1
"He gives large amounts of homework for no reason, I took an online class and it took me at least 10 hours a week (if not more) to do. The worst part is that its mostly just busy work that could be cut out. He's a nice guy, but I would NOT advise taking his classes.",0
Gen Botany with Schaffer is more like a course in molecular bio. not interesting and all memorization. good luck. learned Deringer teaches more ecology stuff in summer,0
"I took his Ethical Hacker and System Security class at the same time during the summer. It was 80% writing and 20% lab and then he screwed me at the end of the semester on my major paper and accused me of plagiarizing after he had told us only to add he references and not use quotation marks in our papers, then he accused me of plagiarism....",0
"Taking Spanish 204 with Profesora SÃ¡nchez is like taking two classes at once. In the first class, you complete predetermined online assignments that relate to the textbook and have casual grading deadlines. In the other class, SÃ¡nchez just lectures on certain legends, history, and musical stuff that she finds interesting about Bolivia and LatinAme.",1
"Very hard to understand. Seemingly doesnt know how to use technology, reads off of slides, and gives little to no instruction for assignments (even exams). Took the joy out of art history and most of my brain cells. Definitely would avoid this prof.",0
"I'm very shy and quiet and I was actually comfortable giving speeches in McAuleys class. Easy A, best taken during summer session, it goes by so quickly.",1
"He might have been a good teacher in 2007 however now not so much. He doesn't teach very well and its hard to take notes because he blocks them half the time. Very awkward to ask questions. Wears the same thing most of the time. Does extend the homework and sends practice test. Attendance is not mandatory, but you might as well just teach yourself.",0
"I think this guy is a great teacher. He really uses his time well. I bet I learned more in this class than any other class and he did it in about 30 minutes of the 75 the class was supposed to be. He is very efficient and I learned a lot. Not an easy class, but it is very challenging. Take it if you want to learn.",1
It was a relief when lectures wrapped up. ,0
"Lyman Johnson is an institution at UNCC. You won't get a better prof than Dr. Johnson at any University, so you better realize what a top-notch professor he is. If you go to UNCC and don't take a class with him, you're making a mistake.",1
"She is one one the most beautiful individuals I have ever met. Just do your work and actually try and she will make sure to help you along the way, if needed. I am truly going to miss her.",1
"She seems terminally ill, but is nice enough.  Just laughs too much as if everything was hilarious.",1
Dr. Alexander is a good man but not so great at staying on topic. He always gets off topic which makes his lectures pointless. Also he posts ALL the notes that he goes over in lecture online which is very helpful. I never went to class after the first day and only used the notes he posted online and did very well.,0
"Overall this instructor SHOULD NOT be teaching ANY  online classes. She will blame everything on the student, and will not accept any of the responsibility. She is also unwilling to assist a student that requests any type of help from her. Taking a class with her is the same as lowering your standards of learning. She is uncaring.",0
Not a good teacher at all,0
"He is ridiculous. This class was such a waste of time. His favorite teaching method is screaming into students ears. He canceled almost half of the classes and was such a waste of time. He hardly taught us anything so we all used the guessing method on the exams. Avoid this class, it ruined my semester!",0
Professor Dyer is a very tough grader. He does not show interest in helping his student. The only solution he may offer is taking a writing intensive class. NO THANK YOU. This class will teach you useful information.,0
"Wonderful! He's so intelligent, funny, and cares about you. His examples make complete sense, and if you have a problem with the class or assignments, he's very easy to contact. He's also head of the humanities division, which makes him knowledgeable about registration and all of the other English classes. Just so helpful and awesome!",1
"So there I was, drudging through the dim world of ceramics when all of a sudden a light shone down from above. ""Do not despair, my child,"" spoke a voice, ""For this evil being known as Amy Kepart will soon depart from the university"" and from then on, the world was green with joy of her departure...",0
"Dr.M-H seems to not know what she is talking about most of the time and says ""Um"" every sentence. Considered a ""dr."" but students in the class seem to have more knowledge on lecture topics. Get ready to refer to the text when studying because class notes do little to nothing to aid test preparation. Cherry on top: Clicker attendance taken.",0
Didnt learn much but extremely easy. Show up every day and you are guaranteed an A. His A's are 80% and up and he gives TONS of extra credit.,1
He is one of the best!!!,1
"Definitely the hardest class and prof I've ever had. Although his lectures were incredibly inciting and usually with a lot of detail to take notes on. Pretty much write down his entire lecture. Definitely would not take again, but I am grateful for all I learned from him, even if it was 8 in the morning.",1
"Clear lectures, generally better than most others teaching the same course. However, he moves through a lot of content too quickly and his midterms/Exams and assignments all very difficult; but hey you learn a LOT! This is an ivy league educated prof teaching a CS course at York so of course it's going to be tough.",1
"He is very knowledgeable & not the type of professor that just spits out info out of the textbook. He is the fastest replier ever and helps as much as he can! To succeed in his class: read the modules before his lecture, answer the practice questions, note most of what he says, familiarize with case studies in ppt & watch the guest speakers videos!",1
"I'm a big fan of Mark, and I have always enjoyed his classes. Unfortunately, it seemed like I didn't even have him as a professor this time around. Mark cancelled a handful of classes throughout the semester, and he was harder to get a hold of too.. Great professor & funny guy! But, for some reason, he had to cancel quite a few classes.",1
Mills is pretty nice and has some good industry information but sometimes her assignments can be pretty frustrating. Could do worse as far as professors go. Class itself involves a pretty big group project in the form of writing a television pilot. Typical group project drama ensues.,1
"I failed ENME 495 3 times with Bauwens. His lectures leave you more confused. Final exams will have questions that he can't provide solutions for. It's pass final pass course for one of the harder technical subjects in mech engg, and with the most incompetent prof in the university. Mech department doesn't care about frequent complaints about him",0
"Great at explaining difficult topics. It can be a hard course if you're not good with Chemistry, but he explains well, and is available to help. Had him for ChemII after a bad professor for ChemI. What a difference. He was able to explain the stuff I didn't get the first time very well.",1
Doug is hilarious. Do well on tests and you'll be fine.,1
"A lot of the class is filled with banter, which can sometimes get repetitive. Throughout the class he'll bring up things he's heard in the news recently, and asks the class what they think about it. It can be awkward with a lot of silence, but as the semester progresses students learn to indulge him. Also, he's difficult to reach through email.",0
"Madame Celli is the best french teacher that I have ever had. She is engaging, makes learning fun, challenges you, and is genuinely one of the nicest people. You can tell that she cares about her students a great deal. I recommend taking any class that you can with her!",1
Pretty simple course content but he did not make significantly contribute to my learning. Very straight forward. Very Intelligent. He always looks angry but is actually quite funny. He is tricky on exams and will test your knowledge on the material. Helpful in office hours.,1
"Norma inspires us all to be better PEOPLE, not just teachers. She is the ultimate role model.",1
"Maria is a fun professor who would dance Tango in class, or cosplay a nun with her scarf. BUT she is disorganized. Almost at the beginning of every class, she spends 5+ minutes looking for her teaching materials. She also forgets giving everyone exam paper on the exam day. And her spoken Spanish is hard to understand.",0
"I took this class for my major for fall semester. Hes really funny in the beginning like what all Professors will do. When he lecture, someone ask questions, he would somehow answer it but the student still dont get it. I would rate more but the characters are limited. My advice is that if youre majoring math and want good grade then avoid him.",0
"She's friendly, but confusing and irritating. The questions she uses for homework are inconsistent with the ones on the tests. She told my class there would be no calculations on our final, and 40% of our test was calculations. I usually got nothing out of her lectures. Wish I would have dropped.",0
"I really like her & even though she goes off on a lot of tangents she gives you a ton of good reading to pursue outside of class if you're interested. There was one required book that we read in the beginning of the semester & assigned other books to read throughout the semester, but they were all at the library and only one person read each book.",1
loved her class! Interesting lectures makes class compelling to attend even though she has no attendance policy. You have to study for the tests but the material isnt difficult - just pay attention! Really wants her students to succeed and is always willing to help!,1
"Comm is not the most exciting subject, but Dr W makes it as much fun as possible. She is pretty easy going as long as you are respectful- don't interrupt other student's speeches, etc. Online exams are poorly written by the publisher, but I think she is changing to a new one. Overall the best.",1
No content in his lectures. It is all conversational kinds of lectures. His tests are very confusing (the wording of the questions & format) and mostly based on his opinion. Lectures are long and boring and even worse when no one participates. Got nothing out of this class! Won't take again.  ,0
"I can honestly say she is one of the worst professors I've ever had. Her methods of teaching in class are sub par and do not prepare you for the overly packed exams she gives. She's very vague in her explanations and passive aggressive. Do not take her for any class. Also, be very thorough with everything that has to do with the plant tour.",0
"There's hw at least 2 times a week but it is easy, there is a textbook but they are just articles that you can print out papers are 5 pages long rubric is easy to understand",1
"Eugene is a really nice man, but it is often really hard to understand him. The class meets twice a week for an hour and fifteen min., and it really is a waste of time. We talk about interesting material, but we do nothing but discuss. No tests, but tons of online work! 6 hours of placement a week! Make sure you have time for this class!!",0
The class is very useful. He likes a couple of students in the fround row and always talk to them.,0
He is the best professor a student can get. Probably the best prof at Seneca. I would recommend every student to take his class.,1
DONT DO IT. Talks in a monotone,0
"Finnicumm is a pretty bad teacher. She just does exercises straight from the textbook and does not put any effort into producing her own material. The test are pretty difficult, considering she doesn't really teach in depth. Going to this class 4 times a week was not fun..",0
absolutely terrible prof. i dropped this gen ed class because he was so bad. he had no idea what he was teaching or anything about the program we were learning so advanced students in the class were actually teaching. you can't pay attention during lectures because all you can hear is your brain melting out of your ears. do not take this prof.,0
She is extremely unclear with what she wants for assignments and papers. She is all over the place! She likes to shut down student's ideas. She is easy but not the type of quality teacher I prefer.,0
"His self-defense class is fun. The only bad side is that he is a tough grader and gives homework that is very tedious. He treats it as a 3 credit course even though its 1 credit. Very passionate about his class and he is also very caring and respectful. I recommend him out of most in the department, just get ready to do a lot of work.",1
"Very intense class. The content is not very easy to understand, and it doesn't help that the lecture examples are way easier than homework questions or midterms/exams. I cannot believe the amount of homework required to be submitted every week, so much paper used in this class. Each question takes up a page. Starts simple, then becomes very hard.",0
"First of all her tests were rediculous--too many obscure facts and EVERY question had 2 ""right"" answers--pick the ""most"" right answer. Yeah OK. Secondly if someone asks a question and you don't know and you say you'll get back to us, it would be nice if you did! And stop watching so much TV!",0
"There is no science in this course, which remains superficial and descriptive. The teacher is still interesting and cares about what he says. The calm of his voice and the lack of structure of his class and PPTs unfortunately don't keep us interested very long. You will easily pass the exam without attending class, or without reading the book.",0
"She won't help unless you READ THE BOOK and put effort into the class.  If you do, you'll be fine. Otherwise expect to struggle a bit.",1
"Amazing professor. Loves what he teaches. Very approachable. Adds passion to the class and gets to know his students. He loves when you participate though. 3 tests, but super super easy and 3 practicals and other busy work for class. Highly recommend this class and professor.",1
"I had Dr. Trammell for Liberated Learning and he was easily my favorite professor this past semester. A non-traditional grading style that actually works in favor of the student. Each class provided awesome content with real life value you simply cannot receive from another course. I never once dreaded coming to class, rather enthused and engaged.",1
"I LOVE taking courses with Dr. Handy! I have no idea what i'm doing when it comes to accounting and she offered extra help, she puts the notes online for you that she does herself on the computer and you can go to her office whenever you need and shes more than happy to help!",1
Dr. G's entomology class was the most enjoyable class I ever took at Centre. He is super passionate and is very caring and fun to work with. His classes are very lecture-heavy but he posts the power points on Moodle and hosts review sessions before exams. Highly recommend him as a professor and HIGHLY recommend his entomology class!,1
"If you are interested in reading crazy amounts a week and getting ridiculous and lengthy assignments, this class is for you. If not, stay far away from the history of christmas. The class begun with 20 students and dwindled down to 4, I think that says enough.",0
The Worst. 60% final made it too long to finish.,0
Seems kind of full of himself.  Assignments are sometimes dull unless you happen to be interested in what he thinks is interesting.,0
I found the lectures to be absolutely useless sue to the fact the professor moves through the content so quickly. However she holds a review session before the test which is helpful. She also is easily accessible after class and is relatively caring for a large lecture professor. MUST COMPLETE THE WEEKLY QUIZZES!!!!!,1
"The class itself is pretty interesting. The class itself has next to no homework, so all you have to do is use the week to study what was discussed in the lecture. TAs were very helpful. Not sure why he gets such a bad rap.",1
Quizzes every Thursday and 3 exams throughout the semester. Exams after every 5 chapters in the textbook. Her exams are very stressful and its important to study a lot in her class.,0
he is horrible...exams have nothing to do with powerpoints or lecture notes...avoid taking him as much as you can....going to class is not gonna help either...this is my first B...I have an 89 and I went to all his stupid lectures....still didn't get a curve ...AVOID AVOID AVOIDDDD!,0
Really great!,1
"Thought she was a good teacher UNTIL after the class was over and I found out about a grade that wasn't explained well or possibly at all on the syllabus and she wouldn't change it, explain the grade given, email back, or meet with me just to clarify a possible misunderstanding, and was rude when I emailed her. It was very unprofessional.",0
"Although he seems knowledgeable about the subject, Hodges does not know how to teach it well (as 101 at least). I always left his lectures feeling more confused than when I walked in. Also if this gives you any indication on how much everyone is understanding this class, my 54% on one exam got bumped to a 90% because of the curve...",0
This dude is outstanding! He is funny and is really passionate about the class. Seriously go to class and don't be on your phone. He sees it and takes off points. His class is fun and an easy A,1
"Thick African Accent, very hard to understand, but it is also very amusing as he runs around the room, screams at the top of his lungs and stomps on the ground...The weather aspect of the class is not there. If you wanna learn something take DiMaio i loved his class....I got a B in Abehs class, there was some take home work, and alot of quizzes.",0
"Great teacher. Lectures generally have a lot of questions and discussions, and she goes over the material really well instead of just reading the slides. One thing I would say is she takes things personally sometimes, like missing a class or getting distracted. Other than that, a great teacher I would recommend.",1
very helpful,1
"I think she is a good professor, because she always responds fast to emails; she is polite, not stuck-up; she is always helpful and flexible. To be objective, I think her weak qualities are that she mostly reads most of lecture material from slide shows rather than explaining it in own words; no smile, most of the time she looks too serious.",1
"Easiest class I have ever taken at GV. He offers so much extra credit that at the end of the semester I could miss 70 points on the final exam and still receive an A. Lectures are a little disorganized, but you can teach yourself a lot of the material. I finished his 6 week online class in 2 weeks.",1
terrible. rude and goes way too fast on the power points. expects way too much out of you.,0
Bamford's a good professor. If you're willing to go in depth into topics it is interesting. If you just want an A for nothing take someone else but it is not hard to do well with her if you do the assignments and speak up you will get a good grade. She is understanding about late work and is nice for a professor.,1
"Egotistical, contradicting, senile Prof that should be avoided. His feedback is horrible, classes are pointless - just save yourself the time and effort and buy a business plan book and avoid classes and prof. It's a shame that Prof's like him give Entrepreneurship a bad name - highly dissatisfied.",0
I had Professor Dattolo for Spanish I and 2 and I am am glad I did. Not only did i learn so much from him but he restored my belief that there are still professors at WPU who really care. He is clear in his explanations and if you ever need extra help or advice he is always there for you. I wish more professors were like Professor Dattolo!,1
"This is a hard class - make no mistake. You need to attend the lectures and pay attention (most lectures were attended by less than half the class which is part of the reason for the terrible scores). Work the homework problems multiple times. And buy the HP calculator, it's far easier than the alternatives (I tried both).",1
"His notes are harder to follow than his name is to say.  Abysmal notes, long tedious assignments, very boring lectures.  He emphasizes everything he says making it very difficult to understand the main points of the lecture.  The class does not follow the textbook by any means, formulas and variables are different.",0
"Midterm was easy, final was awful. Her lectures are difficult to understand and she gets frustrated with questions in office hours, but is sometimes helpful.",0
Disorganized. Loses his train of thought. Boring lecture. Was always late. I eventually stopped going to the lecture because he was not engaging at all. Tutorials is what saved me. Overall would not recommend the class with him teaching it.,0
"really nice guy once you get to know him from getting help on the projects in his office hours, which you have to do because he won't help over email, but the lectures are super dry and the material can be very boring for the most part",0
"pat mckee=GREAT TEACHER for class strings. your grade is UP TO YOU. the entire class is practicing for the little tests. he has a list of things you will need to play, and when you do, he marks it off and to get an A, you do all of them. at the end of the term, all checked=A, missing a couple=B, missing a lot=C, missing most=D, didn't try=F easy.",1
"Awesome guy.  He'll get you to graduate school.  Do the reading, do the work, work even harder and you'll do great in this class.  He has the most amazing sense of humor on campus.",1
"He is one of the greatest profs I know. His drills are pretty interesting, and so is the music. Has unconvential conducting methods in symphonic band, but the music he chooses is great!",1
"She is HARD. But an interesting teacher, and Volpe (the other biz law teacher) isn't any better. Get ready to take super detailed notes, and she just talks no powerpoints or anything. Pay attention and you'll end up with a B. Work hard and you can get an A.",1
"Great prof. Funny and smart.  Her assignments are tough, and you get the grade you deserve. Her lectures are very interesting because she uses multiple visual sources (mostly art), which compliment the class very nicely. She's friendly and charismatic. Best history prof I've had so far.   ",1
She lectures so fast and throws so much information in at oncit's as if she expects us all to know how to do calculus already,0
"Daniela will teach the nightmarish mathematical way of FDs and normalization to prove that a database schema is a good one. Other profs teaching 3220 do not do that, they actually give you better ways (and BETTER grades too!). Daniela's exams have too many questions with so little time. she's the grim reaper of ITEC 3220 --> AVOID HER AT ALL COST",0
"Dr. Federico is such a sweet and caring person. She cares about her students a lot and all she wants to do is share her love of poetry with anyone she can. The class is fun and not too hard. Participation is highly encouraged to get the most out of the class, but Dr. Federico is super easy to talk to. I highly recommend this class and this prof!",1
He's not a very good teacher. Does not do a good job teaching the material that he assigns the homework over. I definitely regret taking his course.,0
"One of the best classes I took at Pitt.  Brilliant lectures, made extremely difficult texts accessible. Lectured for 3 hours straight, never taking a break, with no notes - and kept us rapt and listening.  Philosophy Story Hour. Great.",1
I took discrete math online. Take notes and do homework because its the same on the test. I recommend him!,1
"hated her teaching style, reminds me of high school. she talks bad about students who are not there to the whole class. never had a professor that takes points away for using the bathroom. very strict with attendance, but yet showed up 15 minutes to our final exam. very ignorant about other cultures. wouldnt take her class ever again.",0
"Professor Quam is a great & undemanding teacher. As long as you do the homework and read the textbook, you'd have no problem passing with an A. He is a very easy grader and the assigned homework and tests are not too complicating.",1
"I barely passed this class. Even tho I did all the optional hw, & made my own study guides. He frequently gives you the wrong info in the notes- and then expects you to know the right info on the tests. I highly recommend writing down the practice problems, making a study guide, and going over them with him after class. He will helpifheseesyoucare",0
In my entire collegiate career (15 years) By far the worst math teacher ever. Goes entirely too fast for those of us who are learners by doing. Skipping steps is not a good idea for calculus (the algebra is just as important). Be ready to teach your self the course. Exams are nothing like the book or his lectures. He gets a zero from me!,0
"His lectures are boring and never make much sense, if you ask questions he will just ramble until you forget your question. doesn't explain the basics very well. DON'T BUY THE TEXTBOOK. However his tests are very fair and are EXACTLY what you do in class. Don't take if you need to understand it, but it's an easy A if you just need to pass.",0
"Transitioning to online classes were alright. The lectures didn't line up directly with the homework. He got off topic a lot. Jokes would have been funny if we were in class, but was messy with teaching. All you have to do is the work assigned. He was awesome about turn in days. Am I ready for Chem160? Not that confident. But basics learned I guess",0
He gives really in-depth lectures for the readings we do in class. He is very understanding when you dont do well on exam and let us redo it if we needed to. His lectures are important for understanding the meaning of the readings and taking notes on the lectures are necessary to pass his exams. The exams were straightforward and hes awesome!,1
Professor Gardner is great! She is very helpful and very approachable! I would 100% recommend her! I enjoyed her so much that I rearranged my schedule this semester so I can have her again! She is awesome!,1
"Not really sure why she gets such a bad rep. It might be cause the subject itself is boring. I dont get why people complain about participation, its easy and she sees that you are trying to do well. A lot of boring material to memorize, but the tests arent impossible.  Read the textbook, study the slides and you will be fine.",1
"The lectures are long and you will have to take really good notes.  He pulls material from readings for exams, so be prepared to remember the author of the reading, and the gist of the subject matter.  Fair marker for course work and mid term, hard marker for Final Exam (but final was a take home exam - so that is a MAJOR bonus).",1
"Excellent grades on homework,  and in class knowledge but tough on final project and tests...",1
"May be the odd one, but I've little praise.  Grades good students hard and allows some less brilliant ones to slip through with an ""A"".  I know students who are better grammarians.",1
Professor Adamcyzk's lectures are mainly just doing examples of problems of the topics.  He can be very intimidating to talk to but also helpful.  Go to office hours if you need help.  Attend class and write down examples since exam problems are very similar.,1
"He's a lot of fun. I was nervous when I thought he would be teaching exclusively in Spanish but he'll say it in Spanish first and repeat in English. It may be difficult for you if you struggle with English already but if you can take memorable notes and have a good speaking-partner if you struggle, it's great.",1
Test questions seem to frequently contain material from upcoming chapters that we haven't yet studied. There are often grammar mistakes that make the questions confusing. Questions don't contain enough detail to make a proper decision considering how the law is applied changes depending on those details. Assignments due 6/7 days of the week.,0
"He takes down valid class information beofre it had even been up for a wekend, leaving anyone who hasn't copied it down in time because they were busy behind the rest of the class.",0
"First class I ever took at Augie, and it was HELL. Not a bad person but a terrible teacher. She's super picky with what she expects in your papers and doesnt give clear instructions. She made my class re-write the same paper 3 times! She asks for your opinions but makes you feel stupid and says they're wrong. Highest grade she'll give is a B-.",0
"Best professor I've had by a long shot. He's very clear and makes sure you understand the material before he moves on. He's always willing to give you extra help outside of class when he's there. If you pay attention and do the homework, the exams are a piece of cake.",1
"if you are taking civ with him in the summer be prepared to work.  he tries to squeeze all 15 weeks of a regular course into ten classes.  there are 4 test, a quiz every class, 4 contests and you have 3 writing assignments and a museum assignment. i got an A but i lost the first half of my summer.",1
Babcock is a good prof. The online book has easy tests and quizzes. Once in awhile she gives extra credit for coming to class but you don't need to go to lecture. As long as you get your work done and study for the tests you'll be all set.,1
"i did not like the class.  her test are not easy, i would not take her again",1
"He's okay, kinda hard to understand when he gets going on a topic, but other than that, his subjects and topics are really fun!",0
"Dr. Fowler is great! It is very impressive the amount of information he knows and can deliver an entire lecture off the top of his head. Grade consists of a midterm, final and 5 book reports or a term paper. TA grades everything. Gives you questions to study before exams. Fairly easy if you go to class and take good notes.",1
"I've taken many classes at UD, but this is the only one that's been a complete trainwreck. I have a bit of empathy because covid, but lectures are disorganized and assignments are unclear. The timelines are aggressive, we had a midterm followed by a homework and programming assignment all due within 5 days, only plus being deadlines are flexible",0
Awesome professor. Makes the material very interesting and gives clear criteria for grading. This is the best class I've taken so far.,1
"I have mixed feelings about this professor, but given his providing of an open-book final I would be inclined to recommend him. Quizzes did not seem to reflect what was taught in class, I believe he took his questions from a question bank. Assignments however were very easy as a sample assignment was provided before hand.",1
"Not sure if its just because its online, but the entire course is soooo textbook heavy. Way too much reading and thats what the exam was almost all based on. Seems like a nice prof though but would not take it again",0
"I enjoyed her class. She is very understanding and involved. There is a lot of work doing a field journal but as long as you keep up with it , it isn't a big deal!!!! So my suggestion is get ahead on field journal, communicate, and go to class! I loved her!",1
"class avg C-, unbelievable. Have no idea what he was teaching in class. Even his TA's teaching skill is better.",0
"Best teacher ever! i'm taking her now and she is great, kinda funny and has alot of great ideas for teachers. I wish I had a journal I kept with all her ideas for the classroom! Take her! you won't regret it! She is very understanding and caring and you learn ALOT!",1
"Course is interesting, and helpful in looking for environmental jobs, but prof is terrible! Very boring, always goes off on tangents and covers very little material. LAB IS TRULY TERRIBLE!!! Reports are very long with poor instruction and birng down mark significantly!",0
He is a fantastic lecturer. But he doesn't post midterm grades or communicate clearly when homework is due.,1
"Never shows up on time, likes to keep you late. Doesn't ever use the $200 textbook. Not a very patient person or good teacher. I wouldn't recommend her.",0
"This professor isn't the easiest but he definitley has a passion for his job. He loves for people to interact in class and stay alert. So, come to class and actually try and u will do fine!!! I recommend this teacher",1
Do NOT take this class. This prof is so unorganized. She doesn't lecture at all. She essentially has you read the textbook and complete a reading assignment and wants your answers to line up with hers. However the questions are super vague and the answers are very subjective. She spends class time taking up 1/2 the assignment. Not worth it.,0
"Avoid Him Yu's lectures are so clustered as he overexplains so much and skips steps. I found the textbook was much more helpful than any of his lectures. His evaluations are horrid. Quizzes were 4 questions (1 MC and 3 SA). So if you get all 3 SA perfect (which is more work than 1 MC question) and get the MC wrong, your mark becomes a 75% maximum.",0
"Took the WebCT course. Disorganized and unclear with instructions, Prof. Popovich reminds me of a teacher running down the clock til he retires. Communication took FOREVER, and when he did resopond, he just reworded the syllabus without clarifying. Test questions were overly detail driven. Only take if you can teach yourself and memorize well.",0
"Having this be a gen ed math requirement is okay, especially for those of us who are math challenged, but, if I were on the early el path this class did not provide info on how to handle small children mostly was geared towards upper el and even middle school.  Prof. Wells is informative and well prepared. Take it for your preparednes for teaching.",0
"An absolutely brilliant teacher who knows a lot about her field.  Despite her age, she continues to do research in Middle Eastern Studies.  Her class was very interesting though there are times where she can drag a topic out.  Overall, excellent professor.  OIL!",1
A lot of material needed to remember for tests. Quite specific and a lot of weird names of sites and types of people and time periods you have to remember. Was a difficult course for me.,0
"He is more like a business man than a professor. You may read a lot but still don't know the answer about the exam. The pop quizzes may be the only reason for the attendance. Did curve, but not that much.",0
Chew is way to strict with his grading. everyone is class agrees they didnt recieve the grades on homework they deserved. He is also very stubborn when it comes to revizing the grades even when its obvious he is wrong. Never NEVER take a class with Harvey Chew- you WILL regret it. Positive ratings for him are fake,0
"Professor Tanoukhi is clearly knowledgeable in her field, and a very intelligent woman. However, her teaching style is confusing and often muddled. Does not highlight concepts, but attempts to derive them from quoted text, and does so rather poorly. Rely on the TAs for this class-- they will save you!",0
Marvin is certainly the worst professor i have ever had! do not take his classes they are terrible and he is a aweful teacher. i have never rated a professor before but he is just to awful to not.,0
"Craig is cool and has done a lot in his own career, but thats all his lectures are about- correlating everything back to him. He doesn't respond to emails, cancels class from time to time, and never grades anything. He isn't the most helpful to students in class or those he is the advisor for",0
"I can't stand this class- he teaches the 201 class like a 101 class. Having been in AP English for 2 years, I'm writing in a way that would have been used in my freshman year of High School. The class moves at a slow pace and I am learning nothing. He focuses too much on stereotypes and reinforces them. There is no research- just prove his ideas.",1
she is gud...,1
Best professor I had ever had. would take him again. Explain class well and always give personal experience in the field he worked. I learn a lot from him. good professor. I personally recommend it to you!!!,1
"Barbara was one of the worst professors I've had. Her notes are very dense, aren't really in order sometimes and very confusing for a first level course. Very hard marker, not clear on what she expects. In order to understand the material, expect to teach yourself. Several in class quizzes but the answers you could never get. avoid her if possible.",0
way to hard for an undergraduate course. Should only teach graduate courses,0
Dr. Burkhart is honestly an awful professor. His lectures consist of him screaming for god knows why and he gets so off topic that you have no clue what is going on. His quizzes and tests are unnecessarily hard. He does not use D2L which is ridiculous in my opinion. Definitely wouldnt recommend taking him for any classes. Hes kinda psychotic.,0
"VERY lecture heavy. I am a straight A student and didn't do well on an assignment and I asked if I could make corrections and resubmit, she said no. I was understanding as the assignment only gets one submission, however, the same week, she took late work from the whole semester from other students which didn't seem fair.",0
"I love Dr. Walters-she was one of the best prof. I ever took at SBU.Lots of readings, a couple of papers,one oral presentation-no final.Easy A. Go to class (she knows who's there & who's not) even though she's not strict on attendance.Do the readings & most of all,when she discusses the readings in class write down her every word. It will help you.",1
She's nice and easy to understand. she hates it when you talk in her class though but if you pay attention you shouldn't have problems with exams or anything,1
"Pros: he knows what he's talking about Cons: cocky, arrogant, belittles any student who asks him a question",0
"Ake was the best professor I have had yet at WashU. She made Shakespeare so incredibly fun (which honestly is hard).  She encourages your opinions and discussion, but led most lectures. Always down to laugh, always happy, really helpful and understanding. Wants all her students to succeed which is amazing",1
"I had Professor Durst for Immigration Law. She made a complicated subject clear and was respectful of students and differing viewpoints. She does cold call sometimes, but is not harsh if you do not know the answer. She released a practice test and her grading system, which made clear going into the final what we could expect. Highly recommend!",1
Such a wonderful professor. He is very caring and tries to help students apply the knowledge learned in class to the real world. I would recommend him for anyone.,1
"My favorite teacher by far.    Note taking is imperative, as a lot of things on Mymathlab you'll never see in class or on tests. Anything you take down as notes, expect to see on the exams. Show up, as he does give quizzes that count.  Explains in a very clear manner. You'll work for your grade, but he's the best math teacher I've ever taken.",1
"LOVE Mrs. Barclift!! It doesn't get any better than this. I had her for May and Summer I terms and I laughed the entire 2 hours we were there. She makes learning so much fun, and she really knows what she's talking about. GREAT teacher.",1
"She's a nice lady, very easy math class. Easy tests and homework and lectures are boring but if you pay attention, you'll understand the material with no problem. I would definitely recommend her. ALSO, she takes attendance everyday and will fail you if you miss too many days so don't skip. ",1
Kildea is awesome. Makes class fun with really funny and witty comments. Always there to help you if you need anything. Doesn't require a textbook.,1
omg... i did not have a good experience withthis professor. She failed me on a paper but never gives an explanation why. i only saw her once a week and i dreaded everytime i went. i did however make a b in her class suprisingly.,0
I learned a lot in this class different. I learned to program web application development such as asp net mvc using c#.,1
"This class would be great if someone else taught it. He is very distracted and disorganized. Assignments, expectations, and rubrics are unclear. His lectures are boring and do not help explain the text. I genuinely think he doesn't understand mythology either. I couldn't stay awake in this class without coffee.",0
"Let me start by saying I am great at biology always have and always will. However this womans class made me doubt that. She does not teach. She has slides that have pictures on them and she talks about the pictures, then she expects notes to be taken on what she says which somethings isnt true. Meaning on the test the answer in your noteswrong",0
"It can be a very boring class at times but he is actually really interesting and funny. I never stressed or worried about anything with this class, way easy!",1
"This is the best class I have taken at Oberlin.  Tom Reid is such a nice guy, and it's the only class at Oberlin that makes me feel good about myself everytime I walk out of it.",1
By far one of the worst professors I've ever had. Easy class yet I found myself having to bend over backward just to get an A. Marks you down for no reason. Creates her own grading criteria. I had to email her before every assignment to ask exactly what she was looking for us to do as she never follows the rubric that is provided. It was stressful.,0
If I had the chance to go back and tell myself not to take this course I absolutely would. She is the worst possible teacher you could get at this school. All students fail her exams and she gives no help because even she doesnt understand the material. Cant even answer questions in office hours because you are expected to know it already,0
"Professor Dillon is a wonderful person. She's really caring, and passionate about her subject. The only problem is she is the most unorganized person ever. All her directions are very abstract, thrown-together sentences that hardly make sense. Her syllabus is painful to read, and essay prompts are a headache. She also is not very open minded.",0
"Ive never had so many ridiculous issues with a professor. Im not the first nor will I be the last to say any of this. Incompetent at communicating through email, which is funny because 95% of our homework is turned in through email. I dont even know how he grades because its not on answer accuracy. Will never recommend this professor.",0
Alright professor. Terrible person. Has no sense of empathy. Two weeks of class are spent watching movies. Dismisses class 5-10 min early on most days. Tests are not bad if u study a bit. But he does not even allow university-excused absences. Unclear syllabus and unclear expectations.,0
"Waaaaaaay too much work for the field she presents. You dont learn anything from her readings, truly unacceptable for history students - she almost made me wanna switch my major!",0
"Nice lady but extremely tough grader, especially for such an easy class. Take a different prof.",0
"great instructor. i recommend him for this class. very clear with the expextations, took his time to explain things. i have no prior experience with spanish & took the summer class and i got an A so you know he is a good teacher.",1
Cool guy hard to pass  if u dont like jazz get graded on the 5 exams and participation If ur not going to take time to listen to music posted on bb dont even bother to take class  save ur gpa,0
"Without over-simplifing the subject matter, Sherry is able to make 3-d art approachable and makes success obtainable. I hadn't expected to enjoy 3-d as much as I do. In a no-nonsence manner she helped me overcome my hesitancy towards power-tools and spray paint in order to achieve Art. I'm grateful I had the opporunity to learn from her.",1
"She is a very sweet woman but she gives way too many papers and assignments. In one semester of this class we read 8 books, it was completely unnecessary in my opinion. Very tough grader when it comes to papers and she will leave literally 3 pages of notes/ critiques on your papers. I would avoid her but if you do get stuck you her you wont die.",0
"Professor Hinshaw is simply an amazing person. His class was phenomenal. He is one of the most engaging lecturers I've encountered at Cal and a truly good person. Office hours were such a joy, and I always left with some nugget of wisdom. I wish this class were a year long. I would take any class with this professor! He's one-of-a-kind.",1
"Professor Sethna is an extremely intelligent and articulate person, and she expects the same from her students. She  is tough, but in a great way that allows you to develop critical skills you'll need to have throughout your undergrad. She is extremely helpful if you ask for it and the content of her courses is super interesting. Highly recommend!",1
"The midterm research paper and final count for like your whole grade, so the other stuff barely  matters! She is VERY broad on what will be on the tests, and most are short answer ques. & essay. Teacher is not friendly or helpful at all!!!",0
Very nice woman. Pretty good teacher. Very helpful if you have problems!,1
"This class is painfully slow and they take things wayyyy too serious. You probably won't have a choice of another professor, but just be warned.",0
"Such a rude professor, he is very unprofessional in his responses and is in no way understanding of his students. The course had interesting content, but a lot of it, could have been worth it had the professor not be such an ill character, but I will not be recommending him to anyone.",0
"She is by far the worst teacher I have ever had. Talks down to students and make you feel like you've been sent to prison. Doesn't care about your opinions and doesnât encourage independent thought. If you can be a robot and spit back what she says, word for word, then you might get pass. AVOID!!!",0
"""If you don't pass this class, you'll end up working at McDonald's for the rest of your life."" - Prof. Dewan There's 3 exams for the class, the final is 45% of your grade, that's huge! Prof. Dewan isn't the best a motivation so expect a daily roast when you come to class. Although, I will say this, if you work hard for your grade you'll get it.",0
"DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR. Three tests and a final. THAT'S IT. No quizzes so you don't know how you are doing before the tests, and the tests are only 3 questions. Barely any partial credit, so one question wrong and you have a bad grade. Very smart guy, but cannot get on the students level to teach properly. Flies through the material.",0
"shes not a bad teacher, but she definetely makes you work for a good grade. she gives beefy readings every week followed by a quiz, and if you don't watch the lecture you wont do well. Her exams aren't that hard, honestly if you do the readings and watch the lectures you'll do relatively well.",1
"He is very personable and excited about math. However, in class, he elaborates on tangents that do not exactly assist in understanding, and by the time you have lost focus, he brings the lecture back to his point. I am good with math, but could not follow his information at all. He grades very hard on his tests. I got more information from the net.",0
Hands down the best teacher at IU.,1
"Incredibly rude and condescending, had him for two sessions of Gen Chem II recitation until I switched out. Very confusing too, he explained a concept completely incorrectly despite the entire class arguing with him (I googled it and the class was correct). Avoid at all costs.",0
Very fun and energitic lady,1
"By far the best prof I've had at Rutgers so far. His book of notes is extremely helpful - study that + old exams, go to review sessions, you're fine. He keeps you awake in a difficult class",1
"Smith is very knowledgeable and passionate about government. He is impartial on most political issues but leans left occasionally. He is a standard lecturer, and you probably will need to take notes. On tests he has some difficult essay questions, so you have to have a good understanding of the material. He is quirky but enjoyable as a professor.",1
If you pay attention and attend class you will learn and get a good grade! Prof. Loy kept my attention the whole time; which isn't easy to do! I would suggest him to anyone!,1
"Schumate's class is EASY! only 2 papers due, a 3 page and 12 page essays. We rarely met in class at all... most of the time class was canceled. When she is there she hardly clearly answers your questions, she seemed to be preoccupied with her other classes at SDSU (that's what she admitted once). But overall, it's an easy A class.",0
"Bern really is a great professor. I enjoyed coming to his class and sitting in for his lectures, he really understands the material and relates it back to college student life, because he can also relate. 1 midterm (study!) 1 paper and a nonaccum. final. Take his class, you will find it very enjoyable! His aside notes in his PP's will suffice",1
"Fair grader, sweet disposition, and expectations are pretty clear but beware, he's disorganized. Get familiar with where his office is because you're going to be visiting it a lot.",0
"Gino is a really hard grader. He does not give good feedback and though he is funny a real drawback is the grades. If he wasnt so irresponsible and unhelpful with grading then hed be a great professor, my favorite even. Cmon Gino quit it",0
"Definitely not the greatest professor but definitely not the worst. He is very organized and thorough, but he doesn't have the best personality. He expects everyone to have the same interest as he does for the lessons he teaches.",1
"One project and one paper. Grades are arbitrary and she doesn't have a clear rubric. Hard to know what she wants, but she is looking for super specific things in answers and the paper.",0
Extremely emotionally damaging professor. Puts on a front of caring about her students but is ultimately most concerned with demonstrating her own superiority. Its shameful for Hope College honestly. She will completely tear apart your writing and make jabs at you as a person with almost no actual grounds.,0
"This is a great class. When I took physics in high school, I did not enjoy it, nor did I do well in it until the very end. In his class, he explained the subjects well and made it interesting. I really enjoyed his class, and I can apply physics to my daily life because of it.",1
she is the worst teacher I have ever had I hated her class and dreaded going to it. she is boring and is just ughhhh. DO NOT TAKE HER. avoid her at all costs,0
"I went in knowing nothing about astronomy, and not super interested in it either, but Prof Rao made the class interesting! The lectures are interesting and she cares a lot about her students and gives a ton of extra credit. Take the time to study and you should be fine. Recitation worksheets were confusing, but are mostly graded on participation.",1
Prof. Mangone truly cares about his students. His test are fair and has a good way of conveying the info. Genetics is just a TOUGH subject. 80% of entire grade comes from test which is terrifying if this is not your ideal subject. 5 test each 20% and the lowest one gets dropped,1
Great professor! So funny!,1
"HAHAHA Khalkhali, always good for a laugh! He's pretty hypocritical when it comes to people being late and then coming in 15 mins. after class started. Something to look forward to is his diagram/explanation of ""The Summit of Calculus""..oh my, good stuff!",0
He is a bit intimidating at first but he has a really cool lecturing style and you can tell he genuinely cares for how you are doing. over all a good prof.,1
"I took her class almost twenty years ago and I still remember the satisfaction I felt when I finally earned an A- on a paper. I am an English teacher now and I try to guide my students the way she led me with my writing. (By the way, she would hate the previous sentence.) The class is hard, but you will learn valuable skills.",1
Best professor I've had so far at Wright State. Lectures cover everything on the quizzes and final exam in detail. Very interactive and always willing to answer questions and explain something several times in several different ways until you get it. Loved this class and will seek him out on the class schedule in the future.,1
"Malecha is a wonderful, excited professor. I highly recommend taking a class with him. He is so excited about the topic, and is a fairly easy professor with two 1000/1250 word papers and two tests.  There is a lot of reading, but it is not all necessary, especially if you have others in your class that read.",1
"Good lecturer, but can dwell on irrelevant matters during lecture. Disorganized and the load of work he assigns is ridiculous. I did well in class because I find microbiology really interesting. Overall, he is a good teacher, but you're also expected to work a lot for the grade so keep that in mind. ALSO: FIND A GOOD LAB PARTNER.",1
"This guy is horrible! I'd avoid him it all cost and if you must deal with him I would avoid disagreeing with him or else there will be retributions. If you must take this class sit back, participate, and regurgitate his opinions back into your paper.",0
"Robert has to be one of the worst professors I have ever had. Linear Algebra is a tough course in general, but his lectures never make any sense. He rarely finishes his examples, so there's nothing to go off of when preparing for tests or assignments. He's terrible at explaining things and makes you feel stupid in class. Avoid him if you can.",0
"Professor Allen is the best. You have to go to class he takes attendance everyday, but you have to show up if you want to pass the tests anyways. No homework or quizzes, but there are six tests. He is really funny in class and he takes the time to answer lots of questions and makes sure everyone understands.",1
"As a person she was fantastic, she was very intelligent and about half of the students in my particular class did well. She moves VERY fast and doesnt explain things too well, but shes never rude about it and she is patient. I wouldnt willingly take her again.",0
"For the second part of the course, it was 90% ""online"" which basically meant he provided a ""guest"" video, lecture slide and what chapter to read. When it came to the exam he was not clear at all on which part of the chapters was going to be on the final.",0
He is a smart guy but not cut out for teaching. Just reads off the slides unless he's talking about his own research. Covers way too much material. Would avoid taking the class or wait till a different professor is teaching it.,0
"Took this class online and it wasn't that difficult. If you put in the time and study for the midterm and final, you will pass the class. The only bad thing about this class is the midterm and final make up 40% of your grade. Overall, it's an easy class if you study and put in the work.",1
"I love this man! He is such a great professor and I'm so honoured to have gotten the chance to be in one of his last classes. He's an adorable guy with a lot of cool stories. As for his lectures, it's easy and interesting if a bit name heavy. He says we need to do all the readings to pass the final but I'm going to take my chances. Love him tho",1
"Definitely not an easy class, but he is a good professor. Pay attention to all lectures or you will fall behind. Grade is based on 2 quizzes, 2 exams, and a final. Bonus points given for participation. Gives many chances to redeem yourself and your grade. Gives homework problems, not mandatory nor graded, but impossible to do well without practice",1
"Class is not hard, it's appropriately challenging. Professor Green goes over the textbook information in class and you have everything you need to study for. He is extremely nice and helpful. For all of those who think the class is boring, get to know him and ask questions. He is passionate and knowledgeable. One of my favorite professors!",1
"Kenna is a great public speaking professor. She is friendly and professional, and also is sure to make sure her students get what they need from the class. You will have to put in work, but you'll definitely learn a lot. If she sees you're putting in the work, you'll get a good grade.",1
Great class. Loved attending and the homework pushed you but was manageable. Super clear expectations and engaging.,1
Dr Shahadat is very organized. He prepared everything for the class and gave everything to be read before tests. Tests were neither too easy nor too hard. His marking was also very good. Gave partial mark on everything.,1
"I have had EECS 2001, 3101, and 4101 with Prof. Ruppert. He is truly one of the best profs at York but he is not for you if you don't like proofs since he goes in depth into the proof of everything that is covered. There are also weekly assignments which are a must and without doing them, you'll easily fail.",1
If u r taking this class read everything in the sylabis! You will need it! if she gives u notes b prepared to take a pop quiz next class. Her notes are all over the place bring a recorder. Her tests are hard. STUDY THE TIME LINES! and yes she has favorites.,0
Constant political commentary in a class that has no need for her personal political beliefs. I would not recommend taking her class unless you are open to listening to your professor push her personal far-left agenda.,0
"(also 137A) extremely boring with an unorganized lecture. paces back and forth with continuous babble. no outlines, ppts, etc. Got B+'s so not the worst, doesnt care when you turn in asgmnts or attendance but I will NEVER take him again. The ""freedom"" in his class doesnt replace the tedious amount of work. Is published and def knows what he teaches",0
"Dr. Beck is very enthusiastic with his lectures and he give you tons of info on ecourseware. However, he does give quite a bit of homework and you really have to stay on top of this class at all times to do well. I feel like this is a class that you really have to devote yourself to. The final is hard and the tests are all about practice.",1
Curriculum is very thorough. Course covers a diverse range of topics and there's significant deviation from the syllabus. Homeworks/tests are fair. The course is built for lib. arts students - the quantitative analysis involved will be extremely easy for STEM students. Also - the Professor is EXTREMELY receptive to feedback.,1
"I took Dr. Hanson for a ONE UNIT Honors seminar class and it was one of the hardest classes I've taken. She made us write so many essays, give an entire lecture on dry, heavy philosophical books, and she was VERY picky with grading. She marked up my essays worse than any English teacher I've had and I get A's on papers. Don't highly recommend her.",0
"Webber behaves as though he has discovered some top secret CIA documents and now knows too much. He wont email you grades cause' ""we all know how safe that is""; only answers emails during office hours cause you guessed it, he doesn't think it's safe to have an internet connection at home. Oh and he doesn't lecture, you watch MIT lectures online :D",0
"She gives you WRITING ASSIGNMENTS for a math class. Yes they have math associated, but if the math is wrong, then the entire paper is either given a 1 of a 0 out of 10. Which why even submit a WRITING assignment if it will be graded like that. Also, she doesn't teach. She gives HW and makes you ask questions over it instead of really teaching.",0
This was an awesome class & I always looked forward to his lectures. DO NOT show up late or use your cell phone! Go in with an open mind & be ready to listen to get the most out of his class. Study the study guides for the test & you will pass easily. Can't miss more than 2 classes or will get a C automatically. So glad I took his class.,1
"Cain is a lecture heavy professor and your grade is based on 4 exams. He assigned random homework assignments and never graded them, he just went over them in class and they were never on the exams. Go to lecture and take detailed notes. Go to review sessions and write everything he says. If you can get old exams this helps immensely.",0
"Very good professor, makes everything clear, and goes out of his way to ensure you understand the material.  Says class attendance is mandatory but not enforced but you'll miss critical material 3 tests, 3 HW assignments, no quizzes, possible to cram in the last week w/out reading, only if you attend all in all, best Econ professor, take this class",1
"Genuine interest in students, funny guy.  Not really hard, but not overly easy either.  Over all a great professor.",1
Dr. B is a great teacher! She definitely loves her subject and talks about some of the cool places she has traveled to that relates to the lesson. There's a lot of work that comes with this class but she has done a fabulous job making it accessible for students taking it online.,1
"Professor Holmberg is AMAZING! One of the greatest professors I have ever had. He's hilarious, and he knows more about the subject than literally anyone else. A very easy class but if you want to learn, you will. ",1
"Only attend if you want to train your arm muscle because all you can see is a nerdy doing his own work while covering his writing all the time. In the middle of the course, the prof said we need to do a project so called a substitute of lecture. Seriously, I learn more from wikipedia than doing stupid useless project, and paper projects are useless",0
"I don't think Dr. Self is a bad professor because I did get an A in one of his tests, but Dr. Schroeder made the class a lot harder than it needed to be and that is Dr. Self's responsibility since he is the head instructor. Record lectures (for Dr. Self) and learn all the pathways that exist. I wanted cellular metabolism :/ this class was veryhard.",1
"His accent is extremely hard to understand. I understand he is extremely smart and willing to help, he just doesn't understand how to teach or interact with the students. He has his back to the class almost the whole time writing problems on the board. It is extremely hard to pay attention and I would recommend finding another professor.",0
"She looks unapproachable, but is actually VERY helpful... needs to work on her appearance, I guess. A good coordinator",1
"Extremely easy, learn nothing. Easiest A I've ever gotten.",0
"High expectations, but I have learned a great amount of information pertaining to civic engagement and the structures of the United Nation.",1
Unclear about class he's teaching & unorganized.,0
"easy online class, just one discussion board a week and you reply to one student. no tests or quizzes. the final is a one pg reflection of the course. we had really interesting topics and readings, easy class and you actually learn a lot. solid professor for online. take him!",1
"Enjoy 3 hour long lectures of boredom. Less and less people will show up for class as the semester progresses. She cares about plants a lot, but she does not care about you. She knows a lot about botany, but shouldn't be teaching it.",0
Not very helpful at all. He never replies to his emails and never shows up during office hours. The Lab Instructor of this course is not very helpful as well. He told me during lab to do the experiment by myself. I felt that the lab instructor he favored white over brown. Mr Nelson did not do anything as he never replies to his emails.,0
"She is new to Gonzaga but she is young, so smart, pretty, and very engaging. Super refreshing to be able to relate to a professor. She asks ""questions of the day"" and plays music while we work. She is not the easiest grader but her feedback just makes you better. She is awesome take her class! Her class is not dull and goes by really quickly.",1
"Never have I had a professor so passionate about the material that he brought himself to tears while laughing during his lecture. This man LOVES to teach. He expects you to work, but if you do, you'll get a good great and leave with a boat-load of knowledge.",1
"not a great teacher. there are no discussions he just reads off the powerpoint word for word. ALOT of reading, you can tell he doesnt care about the students only his paychecks.",0
"Does not use the textbook like other profs for this course do, but didn't tell us ahead of time so many students had purchased it already. Lecture heavy and can be boring. Four group projects, present one of them. Three quizzes and an online final. Many opportunities for extra credit. Sign in for attendance but isn't for points. Okay overall.",0
"By far the worst experience I've ever had in a classroom. Professor was condescending, rude, and abrasive at all times. Feedback on papers was obnoxious, unhelpful and illiegible. If you attempted to make a point contrary to what he believed, he would simply call it ""irrelevant"". I will never take this professor again.",0
"If you show up & pay attention you can get a lot out of the class. I, however, tend to not show up a& not pay attention. All homework and tests were online, so it's pretty easy. He does NOT communicate. Although you need to be prepared to teach yourself, I still think he's a decent teacher.",0
"Dr. Carroll was literally the easiest professor I have had in college. I only went to class on exam days. You have weekly TED talk discussion boards and weekly quizzes but the quizzes you get 4 tries to get the right answer. His exams are 50 questions, multiple choice and he takes them word by word from a 200 question study guide. Super easy!!!!",1
"His tests are impossible to complete. He gets pissed when students ask a question about a concept over and over and says ""come on guys it's easy stuff"". Yeah, it's easy for him who's been teaching math for 100 years, not for students. He said he expects the class to mostly get Ds and Cs. The Average for both Midterms was BOTH LESS THAN 40.",0
"Avoid this prof at ALL costs. I'm in my fourth year and this was one of my toughest classes, it was supposed to be an elective. Lectures took me 4 hours to get through, no midterm review, tons of textbook material, HARD and time-constraining tests, and extremely hard marker on essays. She was also short with me when I emailed her a question. AVOID!",0
"She was terrible, annoying to communicate with.",0
She has a great personality and is really interested in her students.  She has a great deal of knowledge and she is very accomidating.  I think she is a great professor and a wonderful person.,1
"OK professor. This class was very easy, but his attempt to teach/help was never sufficient enough. My classmates always seemed frustrated to follow and he'll mock you if you didn't understand. I didn't need to attend his class to pass his tests b/c I felt like the textbook was much more helpful! I'd say it's only mandatory to turn in hw/for tests.",0
"very rude professor, puts everyone down to let everyone know that she knows better than everyone else. Ever met a petty professor ? well now you have. the class itself isn't bad, but her manners are elsewhere. i don't know if shes going through a serious case of menopause, but she shouldn't have to take it out on other students.",0
"Well I rememember this professor from Economics, I did the graphs over and over and over. He answered all of my questions. If only all professors were as good as he is.",1
"Keeps class fun, only a few tests, but does a TON of practice and review beforehand. You'll be well prepared. no unnecessary memorization.",1
"Easy class, Pierce knows his stuff and loves to teach others about it. Every review you should have answers word from lectures, there is no hidden or hard questions about his test. Pay attention, and you'll easily pass. He is hilarious would highly recommend for a GPA booster!",1
"What the heck are you talking about?  He definitely has concern for his students.  Also, even though he's a really hard grader, he gives you the chance to discuss weak points and pass in re-writes.  *in-class discussions are very interesting and open*",1
"You should only take her class if you are proficient in math. She makes many mistakes and often gets confused. A nice lady, though.",0
"If you don't know how to draw, DO NOT TAKE HIM! In drawing 1, he was expecting photo-realistic drawings our 2nd week. He likes to critique viciously without us knowing the proper techniques for how to fix them. I've never seen him draw anything. He told us to drop the class if it wasn't our favorite, he's apparently never heard of student loans.",0
"This professor is absolutely awful, I would not recommend her at all. She tries really hard to sound smart but when she does it just gets confusing. She is very unclear when giving instructions and it is either her way or the highway. She is a hard grader and is not willing to work with you if you need help.",0
he's stupid he doesn't know what he's doing his verrrrrrrry unclear and disorganized with his excent you can't understand a WORD of what  he's saying DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASSSESSSS,0
She is absolutely amazing. she grade fairly and will help those who want it more then those who dont. You will learn in her class it also helps that the classes are small,1
"DON""T TAKE HER CLASS. HER EXAMS ARE OPEN BOOK BUT I SWEAR THE QUESTIONS COME FROM THE SKY. SHE THINKS SHE CARES FOR YOU BUT SHE DOESN'T",0
"Unfortunately she is the only teacher for this course. Youn have to study your butt off for tests,reviews are useless.  She knows her stuff but DEFINITELY cant teach it so you understand.  If you ask her a question she just repeats whats in her notes. Goes way too fast for all the info she gives you.  Good luck",0
He didn't cover too much background of the first half of OT - it's more or less a Sunday School lesson.. but more expensive. He wasn't approachable; had a very busy schedule and communication goes through the department secretary who was also unapproachable. Gave an assignment that was unfairly graded. Gave push back when it was brought up.,0
By far taking this class was that best decision I've ever made at BCC. Never had a dull moment in class. Wish there were more classes. Very helpful. Would suggest any of his classes.,1
"If you rely on homework as a cushion for tests, this is the class for you. The grades are based on the unit averages. For example, workbook average score, tests average score. If you are not good with homework and keeping up on time then this will be a painful realization to get yourself in check.",0
"Dr. Gelderloos is an extraordinary person. We are so lucky to have him at the University of Michigan-Dearborn. After reading all of the positive comments about Dr. G, its clear-his passion for students, biology, and the environment is contagious and moving. This class is the most level-headed and engaging introduction to environ. issues. TAKE",1
I truly enjoyed taking this class. You will learn a lot. This class was my first online summer class and I didn't feel overwhelmed with the assignments. Do the reading and you will definitely pass all the quizzes. There is one paper and it is very interesting and fun. I highly recommend taking this class for your U.S./NV Constitution credits.,1
smokin body,1
"Class is easy and prof. is friendly. Teaches off of the powerpoint slides that are posted before class, 4 homework problems each week. Exams are not difficult plus you are allowed a 2-sided cheat sheet.",1
Great teacher.  Loves her students and very interested in whether they learn or not.  Great asset to CSUB spanish department.,1
Great teacher knows her stuff! boring class sometimes felt pointless and unnecessarily long.,1
Don't take this professor. He is unclear on assignments and is one of the toughest graders I've ever met.,0
Worst professor at umaine. he is so boring and he does not care about you if you have a different opinion than his. very self centered and immature. do not take any classes with him. ,0
"Amazing professors. Honestly just try your best and he will see that. Never skip class, 'cause, he will make you his B. I have had him for many classes and he is chill and laid back. Just do what you have to do and participate.",1
best prof ive had.very clear.very helpful.funny.talk a lot more than the course.,1
Alisa is an amazing teacher!! I was terrified of taking math and I passed with a B! I would suggest to ANYONE needing to take 015 to take it from Alisa.,1
"Horrible teacher his test relate nothing to his lectures he will not tell you your final grade he says there is a rule preventing him from doing so, his test are painfully hard and his grading scale is even harder to understand if you can find another teacher that teaches the same classes take the other teacher instead do not take Graves ",0
"I hated this class. I wouldn't even take this class if it wasn't required. She is outright rude and it seems like she has something against me. Her quizzes are ridiculous. She expects you to remember the most obscure details from the reading that is hard to comprehend. Her instructions are unclear and virtually unapproachable. If you can, AVOID",0
"If you're taking Chem167 it doesn't matter which professor you are taking it with besides for lectures. All of the professors use the same blackboard page and will have the same exams and quizzes. Expect a fair amount of homework, quizzes, and TopHat questions. If you read the book ahead of time nothing said during the lecture will be new to you.",1
I took this course Spring 2013 via video stream. The instructor deducted points for not attending onsite. This is an instructor who should retire. Fails to post any grades online or go over exam results. Text book is used as secondary reference you need to only know the slides and lecture material. Try to take a different instructor.,0
Took Stat200 asynchronous online. There were no lectures-- just powerpoint slides that were impossible to learn from. I was only able to learn from the MyStatLab homework assignments. He didn't teach at all but the tests were exactly like the homework so not that bad.,0
Gentle and caring professor sincerely interested in conveying an understanding of the literature at hand. I had him for three classes.,1
"Very Nice Guy, Helpful, and willing to listen. However if you are a person who relies on emailing teachers. He is really bad at responding i've sent him to email prior to test days and he has never responded to them.",1
"There's no clear direction for his class. If you want an easy A, sure, go ahead, take it. If you actually want to learn about media, stay away. Lectures are ridiculous. He rambles on about his radical views that have nothing to do with the class. You don't need to show up to do well. All late work is a zero; he doesn't accept any excuses.",0
Best professor I have had in my 4 years at U of T. Goes above and beyond to make sure you understand.,1
"He's a G, an absolute beauty. He explains things really well, and his voice is loud and clear. He's overall just a good teacher.... aka doesn't have to pause in the middle of class to look at notes etc..",1
"He is such a cute little man who loves to teach! Mondays and Fridays are always lecture with slides... if you actually listen it can be interesting and he always has a whole bunch of fun slides to show. Papers are no longer than one page and discussion days are fun if you get involved. This was a good class, good A.",1
"Stevens is the reason why I switched my major. I can't believe this guy. He grades so roughly and doesn't seem to care at all about his students. Granted, I am really glad that I switched my major because I'm happier now, but Scott is the reason that I ended up having no faith in myself to have a good grade. Avoid at all costs and get a diff prof",0
"dr kennedy is a good man, but doesnt seem to be good at communicating. he's an awesome chemist though. listen to his lectures and you will do well",1
"Test 1 was a passing grade by context though class day 1 I was absent. Received a 0! Because I didn't answer the quiz word for word his answer from the day 1 lecture. He demands that you write his answers verbatim on tests. He mocked 9/11 and was rude. Hands down the worst professor at CCU. As an alumnus of 2008, I can say this person is a tyrant.",0
"Worst teacher at Trent. She has no clue whats talking about. Reads off cue cards like an anxious child and has absolutely no brain without them. Hard marker. Likes to be nice in public, rude in private. Surprised the department hasnt fired her yet. Never again.",0
Funny guy in lectures but very different when you go and see him in his office. Will come up with questions that you have not been prepared for and won't give you enough time to complete them..,0
Worst teacher I have ever had at UNLV. Half the time his lessons are confusing and make very little sense. He constantly confuses himself and makes mistakes on the simplest problems. He seems to take pleasure out of humiliating students. I would not recommend this class to ANYONE.,0
I took this class online and it was a great experience. She was very easy to work with and made all of the expectations very clear. She was very good about responding to emails promptly and when Myaccounyinglab was down for maintenance she was very good about allowing us extra time for assignments and quizes,1
Amazing lectures. One of the best at york. Tough Grader. Should work hard and that helps a lot outside.,1
"Her lectures are just onlines, you have to type in every word she says in order to get the notes, which makes things difficult and makes going to class a must. Her exams have both lecture and book questions, so you do have to read the book. She's not the most approachable person. If there's someone better, take them.",1
"One of the worst professors Ive ever had. Never emails back but leaves vague comments on your assignments and expects you to know what is wrong. She is a tough grader; I received an F on a paper and was given a second try, added 2 sentences and got a B.",0
Easy class. Just go to lectures and you'll do fine. Always curves tests.Class is cancelled sometimes because he has court. Overall good professor.,1
Only offered one extra credit assignment out of the whole semester. She does not answer emails regarding questions or grading. When I asked questions in her class she made me feel stupid and when I asked for help she just told me to figure it out on my own. Honestly your pretty much on your own.,0
"This prof also runs the skills lab and does not do anything for the students. She spends most of the time socializing with co-workers while she ignores students in the lab, or kicks them out for a hair appt. BTW the lab hours are always scheduled during class so you can never go. Completely useless...",0
Easily the best professor I've ever had during my time at UC. Evan is wonderful. Genuinely cares about the topics he covers and is endlessly entertaining in his lectures. Lectures in Interpersonal Communication feel less like a slog and more like a journey. Cannot recommend Evan enough. Wish I had him in person!,1
As a person who has always loved music and played an instrument since the 6th grade I was very excited to begin taking music theory classes. I was disappointed when I began to notice that lecture consisted only of him reciting word for word the textbook that we were reading and doing online practice for outside of class. Overall very dull and dry.,0
"Heavy dependance on book and extremely difficult tests. Deducts large amount of points for tiny mistakes. Cares about students, but isn't afraid to insult their intelligence in class (especially after a poor quiz). 90% of learned material you teach yourself. Expects you to devote most of your time to his class only (10 hour a week minimum).",0
AMAZING PROFESSOR! YOU MUST TAKE HIS CLASS. HE IS VERY INTERESTING CLASSES ARE FUN AND TEST ARE EASY IF YOU PAY ATTENTION TO HIS LECTURES!,1
"DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR. I took this class for a breadth and regret doing so. It's is incredibly boring. All she does is drone on and on and no one listens. Awful teaching. There are 5 pop quizzes that the class average is always a 60-70%. If you're going to take this class, take it with a different professor.",0
"I enjoyed his class because the material was interesting but I can see how sometimes he could be dull. His exams were SOOO easy, and he was just generally a nice guy.",1
"I had her for Spanish 103 and I love her! She is very funny and made discussion entertaining. I believe she grade pretty hard, but she is a awesome teacher. I'd register for her class asap. She is better than most Spanish's teachers I heard from my friends.",1
Avoid at all cost. Very distant and disorganized.,0
"Not very helpful, hard grader on papers, however hard to fail her class. If you have a view that is not parralell to her own you are wrong. I give her a C overall",0
Hard grader no mercy of second chances to pass,0
"3 Hours means three hours. You have snow days? Be ready to stay till 10-10:30. The man wants to get his point across. Only problem with him is if he didn't tell so many stories, we'd be out at 9:15.",1
"Very easy class, assignments weren't bad at all. Videos he provides show you exactly what to do and how to change the website to your liking. He's very responsive if you ever have questions. Overall I loved this class and it was enjoyable. recommend anyone to take it, best class I've had (:",1
"Very good professor, knowledgeable. Most of the classmates can't even do basic algebra! Don't know why they are in this class and keep complaining!",1
"Complete Jerk. He knows his stuff but expects that you already do too. Analyzing ancient texts, 15 page papers, crazy homework. Offers extra credit but it wont help much. Took it as a history elective for a fun good grade. Ended up getting a W to save my gpa. So arrogant and rude. Just save yourself the time. Dont take him. Youve been warned!",0
Very interesting class; who doesn't love watching films in class?  Professor makes things very interesting and provides lots of tidbits.  Reading the textbook is practically a must but it's interesting as well.  Definitely recommending.,1
"Dr. Brown is a charismatic guy but  not an easy professor. Needed to memorize a lot of info that wasn't all on the slides so you really had to pay attention (speaks at low volume). Not many tests so there's a lot on each one - expects very specific dates, locations, multiple examples (all short answer). Too in depth for an intro level class.",1
"really knowledgeable professor but terrible delivery. notes are written in all caps, different colours, and filled with spelling mistakes. chapter notes are frequently 30 page word documents. talks about personal life A LOT. could be a good professor but I didn't like her",0
 The lectures are very clear and concise and is willing to make sure that everyone understands a concept before moving on. There is a lot of memorization for the tests. The textbook is not necessary as long as you attend every class and take good notes. There are a lot of notes to take but I learned so much in this class. ,1
She is not clear on the homework assignments and when you ask questions it just becomes less understandable Also shes crazy about attendance. She is a good lady just not a good teacher.4 major assignments and mid term and final are take home & take 8-20 hrs its no joke. would not recommend. grades very hard and doesn't put up grade till weeks later,0
"I would not recommend taking Dr. Kageyama. He does not know how to run a class. His lectures are confusing, study guides are not helpful, and tests are hard. The class average for both the midterms was 60%. He had to apply big curves and offer a bunch of extra credit just so we had a chance at passing. We also never got our project grades back. ",0
"I'm a senior, and I've rarely seen any class that demanded this amt of info recall. Prof is a sweetheart, but unclear. Final should NOT be cumulative! Students that love bio/arch usually love this class. If you don't, it will be really tough. That said, his handouts are KEY; use them to organize the info or it's totally overwhelming.",0
"Durham is a great teacher and a good man. He cares about every one of his students, and will help them in any way he can. The class isn't easy and he's a tough-ish grader, but that's because he wants his students to learn as much as possible. Take this class if you want to be intellectually challenged and learn about the world. Email him for help!",1
"I took his online class, taught it jointly with another professor.  Weekly test that cover the topics of that week.  Online lectures were good.  You can get through the test on the lectures alone but reading the material provided will be helpful.  I didn't find the class difficult, with a good understanding of the basic concepts you'll do well.",1
"Lectures focus on practice problems, not theory. Does not assign homework, so your grade is based solely on 3 tests - 2 midterms and the final. Grading is not curved, and he will give zeroes on problems with no clear reason why. He really knows his stuff, but his class is tough to pass. I do not plan on taking his class again.",0
"Doesn't go through examples thoroughly. Practice and practice more! The key to passing the tests is know your reactions top to bottom, backwards and forwards. I'm not joking. Half class dropped, many students in there were repeating the course for a 2nd and 3rd time with him. Reading the book helps a lot/homework. Lectures don't cover everything!",0
"Mary is a very nice lady and is very brilliant and accomplished. However, she was maybe not the best teacher ever for Intro Enviro Geo. It often felt like we weren't actually learning anything, and we were assigned a Lot of reading that was actually never relevant ever. But she is nice and probably good for upper-level geo from what I hear.",0
Dr. Too is a genous... but definitely not a great teacher. I'm a student with a 3.8 GPA but I struggled in his class. Just be ready to study and do a lot of work on your own.,0
Typical prof but did you know that he got his in BA in math at age 14 and PhD in math at age 20?,1
good prof. you'll learn a lot. Fair grader.,1
"Personally thought this professor needs to take it easy with all the jokes, its very annoying & the man moves to fast when hes teaching , he needs to slow down and last but not least it seems he is always trying to push tests ahead of schedule i don't think this is good for all students.",0
"Good Professor.  Not as funny as he thinks he is, but damm smart. Tests are fair but long.  Big final presentation in both.",1
"She's an amazing professor and you can tell she loves the subject that she is teaching. A lot of reading, and quizzes everyday but if you read you'll do fine. She really is willing to help and leaves a loophole if you miss a class or two. I love her I took both of her classes and enjoyed them.",1
His lecture are so dry. Very boring..,0
"Best teacher on campus, and he knows it. Brown nosing is an easy way to get his attention, but if you can show him how witty you are on tests and when you talk with him, it doesnt matter who you are, he'll like you. Yes his class can be hard, but once your done youll realize its not that bad. TAKE HIS CLASS NO MATTER WHAT",1
"Tom Reid is truly a god among men.  thanks to him my average went from an 85 to a 120, and it's still climbing.  i now also find myself in bowling 2, working at the lanes and participating in 3 leagues weekly.  how did this happen, you may ask?  well, seriously, have you ever MET Tom Reid?  the man is charming.",1
"Dr. Simerka is AMAZING. I have never had a more helpful or involved Professor. She is quick to answer emails and gives incredibly helpful constructive feedback. She was encouraging, funny, and provided a plethora of support to her students. She is an expert in her subject and I thoroughly enjoyed learning from her. If you get the chance, take her!",1
"He is such a tough grader. No matter how hard you try, don't expect an A in this class.",0
His explanations are good and easy to understand. Show up and pass. Simple.,1
"Worst professor I've ever had. Blames students for bad exam grades, never returned any of project grades. Nobody knew how they were doing in the class until the final grades were posted.",0
I would not recommend taking him. He doesnt give any chances to bring your grade up. It is 5 test that reflect your grade. He reads straight off the power points(which you can do yourself) and it doesnt really help. And his grading is tough and terrible. You could label as much as you can on your test and he still wIll give you 1/5. Dont take!,0
"As with any other math class at umbc, you will probably have to teach yourself. Sure Kapoor may not be the best professor but the class isnt bad as many seem to make of it. The quizzes and tests are similar in format to the lectures and online hw so as long as you are paying attention in class, taking notes and doing your hw this class is a breeze",1
open book open note take home tests. uses videos. talks too much. grad school prep class,1
"Took his class during COVID. I faced a lot of obstacles that were out of my control during this semester. I had explained to him in an email but he did not make any accommodations, not that he was supposed to. I lost two close family members and found it difficult to concentrate. Tests are difficult and homework is done in groups. 1 group project.",0
"She is the best ECE professor I've had so far. Very clear, knowledgable, and kind. Exams are fair and closely follow the study guide she provides. No question on exam that's not covered on lectures or homework. Strongly recommended...",1
Good day Sir. We are students from the Philippines. We would like to ask for your permission for using your survey. We would like to have more in depth research about your survey. Thank you and have a nice day Sir.,1
"Clemens is super hard, not really in a good way either. It is like he goes out of his way to make his class extremely difficult. His tests are impossible and you are given no time plus he grades your papers expecting you to be the best writer in the country. Avoid him if you can.",0
"Shelley just simply doesn't know how to teach. She talks to us like we're all geology majors, so she rarely defines basic things as she's talking about them. Her powerpoints are vague and she draws on them during class, so you don't have that to study unless you print them out before class and draw with her. I would avoid unless you're into geology",0
"Doesn't really seem to even know what he's talking about, says one thing and then marks it wrong later. Rambles. He makes easy topics way too confusing. What could be said with one sentence he takes 45 min to say and just gets confusing. Avoid at all costs",0
Brent knows his stuff and tells you way more than you need to know. He gets way to in depth which makes it hard to stay engaged. Quizzes are short answer and very hard. He grades very tough. He is a good guy that knows his stuff. He loves the study of seeds for some odd reason.,1
Does not have point system for grading. If he feels your paper is a B he will simply give you a B with no reference to a point ruberic,0
She is not well suited for her job whatsoever. She assigns very long papers and I highly doubt she even reads all of them all the way. I had my paper given back to me with a grade of 95 (she also circles where the student makes mistakes) and when I was revising the paper I found a couple of errors that she didn't even circle. Did she even read it?,0
Definitely take this course with her if you like for people to be condescending to you. Heavy workload. Assumes everyone wants to be a Pollution Manager...This course and instructor were so not worth my time. The material could be interesting if you didn't have to WASTE so much time being an English major for an Environmental Studies course.,0
BEST TEACHER EVER!!!!!!! TAKE HER ,1
"Would not take with him he is always off topic, we were 4 chapters behind where we should have been give easy questions for assignments and super hard ones for test. Doesn't explain things well. Would not take again with him",0
"Horrible teacher. Took him for eth hack, and it was clear he has never done it in the field. Could not bring any real world experience to the class. Many students walked in knowing more than him. All of his labs could be found online for free. Doesn't use updated material. Tests have nothing to do with the material he covered.",0
"I am an A student. This class was hard. There is a TON of reading. If you like to read then I would say take the class. However the entire course is made up of 4 exams. There are no homework assignments, just 4 tests. If you dont do well on test, dont take the class. Very lecture heavy!",0
"Sidenote: If you haven't taken BIO 324 but need to, take these two at the same time. A lot of information overlaps, at least if you take cell bio with Juris. Might as well study for two exams at once.",1
"Talks about her family too much, extremely unhelpful in labs. You might as well do it yourself or take this class online. Class discussions very boring and you have too many labs to do in a little time.  Nice lady but I would get a different Professor.",0
Gives lots of interesting tangents and stories. At times he can seem kind of full of himself. Also can seem like a bit of a jerk but he is usually joking. Because he gets off topic frequently and for long amounts of time he often goes through the material very quickly.,1
"Immensely rigorous instructor, will be the toughest you've had to date. I highly respect her and believe her style of lecture is an art. However, of a class of 30, over 20 students got a C. It is possible to be successful with her, but very difficult. Don't fall into the hype of taking her. You have options, consider going elsewhere for an A.",0
"Lectures hard to follow, pretty rude in office hours. You understand the material with his study guides, which are nearly identical to the exam he gives you, but he doesn't give you the answers, and you have to look for them in his disorganized lectures/google. 95-100 is an A which is pretty ass, no drops, no curve. But Rohini Qamra was lit.",0
"Attend class, do your readings and you will do well. ",1
****-IBLE!!!!!! Only Prof. teaching the class though.. brace yourself!,0
"Has a serious issue with grammar and english herself and yet grades really hard. Has you write weekly, sometimes biweekly papers that don't help at all and that have really unclear guidelines, such as repeating questions or seemingly wrong order, etc. Overall, just too chaotic.",0
This professor was probably one of the worst ones I have ever had. His lectures do not help you in the slightest and you can get more out of reading the book. There are no study material so good luck on the tests. The highest grade I ever got was a 76% and I studied weeks prior. Half the information on the test wasn't given anywhere. dont recommend,0
"ogilvie is a great professor. he's lucid, brilliant, and helpful. maybe he moves a little fast, but that's only on account of the fact that he's got such a wealth of knowledge. if there can be any complaint about him, it's that he's a little more scholar than teacher. but he offers great insights and is easily the best professor in the department.",1
what an enthusiastic and wonderful man. meet his daughter immediately.,1
Had him for Interpersonal Communication. Going to an 8am class didn't appeal to me at first. Turned out to be similar to watching a comedian. Cried tears of laughter every single class. Puts people on the spot quite a bit - but you will have a blast. Definitely take a class with him if you can at some point.,1
Extremely unhelpful and cancelled office hours frequently.  Tests were very difficult and had questions that weren't anything like our homework or lecture examples.  He used different notation and equations than our textbook which made following him in lecture difficult.  Doesn't post any lecture notes or solutions to homework or tests online.   ,0
"He's a great guy and means well but there is so much homework in the weekly assignments and his lectures are very hard to follow. When reviewing his notes, his workings are very messy and unorganized. Exams tend to have harder questions on them compared to what is covered in class.",1
"He is very funny, and makes the topic lighter than it normally would be. Makes it so the material its understood.",1
"Dr. Maher is an amazing professor and scholar, his classes on Buddhism and Hinduism were by far some of the most interesting classes I have taken at ECU. He cares deeply about the success of his students, and will go the extra mile to meet with you and help you if you are having problems. If you attend class and take notes, you should be fine!",1
"Its kinda hard to rate this professor seeing as though he doesn't really teach. The assistants help but he rarely interacts with the class himself except to tell you what is due, other than that its pretty much a teach yourself course so the professor doesn't really matter, because its mostly online and done through myitlab",1
This teacher is one of the worst teachers I've ever had. You must read the textbook to get a decent grade for the exams. His feedback is very short and not specific. He never responded to my emails. There was an incident where a student was left out of their group and he never addressed the problem. Good luck reading his writing on the whiteboard.,0
"I LOVE this lady. She is so funny and really cares about you. Really easy to get an A if you have a good background in French. She does have an accent, so if you have trouble understanding accents, she may not be your best option. Otherwise, I highly recommend her.",1
He was my online instructor and was phenomenal. I met him once during a social service assignment. His field expertise and motivation was above par!,1
"AWFUL! He is rude, condescending, and refuses to help students. I studied for hours and barely passed. Avoid this prof!",0
"No office hours, no owl page, no proper lectures, all you get are ridiculously difficult assignments and snarky remarks from this prof.",0
"Nice and enthusiastic in the beginning and knows his stuff, but honestly very unhelpful and only explains things once in his weird way. We were given a lab to do with very little instruction and I did everything I can to do well at best but I still got a bad grade. Lecture heavy and always blamed us if we did poorly. His tests are so hard. terrible",0
Awesome -- but only if you want to waste your time and your money and just about anything else you can possibly waste.  Avoid at all costs!!!!!,0
She is very nice and helpful if you ask for it. There are weekly quizzes from the material from the previous week. The tests are tough!! Not a class you study for the night before. There is 1 paper and a group project that weren't too bad. She gives extra credit but it's not a lot. If you don't do the readings you won't do well.,1
"His online Abnormal Psych class is set up very nicely in that there are only 2 quizzes a week based on chapter readings. This makes the class seem relatively easy, he provides two practice quizzes before each quiz as well as flashcards to help you prepare. However, many of the questions on his quizzes are repetitive, poorly worded, and irrelevant.",0
"A lot of people dont like Dr. Delgado because of the amount of work she assigns but, every single thing she assigned had a purpose. I feel so much better prepared after her class and i dont regret taking it at all. The other common complaint is her personality. She is a sassy gal, so if you cant take the heat, get out of the kitchen.",1
"One of the best professors I've ever had.  She is extremely interested in what everybody has to say.  She's talkative and very funny.  However, this is a gen ed class, so nobody in class cared or talked (which really pissed her off).  Overall, readings and participation are necessary, but still a good class.  Take it if you're willing to talk.",1
Professor Stewart was an easy grader and very straight and to the point.,1
"I love her! You can tell how much she cares about her students and how much she loves what she does. She's the grandma that you wish you had. Her class was easy, not many tough projects, and she was very understanding if you had an issue understanding the material. Class isn't memorization based, she wants you to learn how to think critically.",1
"TrÃ¨s bon prof, cours agrÃ©able! Mais il y a quand mÃªme une pas pire charge de travail (c'est quand mÃªme du franÃ§ais) Ãa se fait trÃ¨s bien !",1
"I had a great time in his class and learned a lot from him. He's a pretty free spirit and open to suggestions and new ideas! Ask him about some of his art projects, they're really cool. He got me really excited about process art!",1
"Easily one of my favorite professors at Creighton. Had him for a few classes and loved them. He's super funny and wants to help you. His classes are tough, so be prepared to study hard. At the end of the semester, you know the material like the back of your hand. Amazing man.",1
"I have depression, which sometimes keeps me from being in class or doing work - Dr. Shiba worked with me to make sure I passed. As long as you communicate, she will work with you.",1
Bad at explaining and awful with notes,0
Good professor but short tough multiple choice questions for lecture exam,1
"Honors Seminar on writing a book on South Africa - digital version of class to come! Tischio is a gem, so sweet and wants everyone to excel! She is not afraid to change syllabus if things no longer make sense, and is super flexible. No tests, one presentation, group essay and final reflection paper. I loved her and cant wait to take her next sem!",1
She is the worst teacher ever. She literally stands there with a microphone and talks. No one paid attention and literally the whole class failed every test. Whatever you do DO NOT TAKE HER. SHE IS ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE.,0
I am a student at UCSB and took this CC English class to get some credit done. SHE DOES NOT TELL YOU YOUR GRADE so you have no idea how you are doing in this class. This class was harder than any UCSB class ive taken(math and bio double major). GRADES POETRY as if there is only one interpretation (C on midterm because didnt like my ideas. DONT TAKE,0
"I took ED 672 online winter 09. It was the worst class I ever took. Don't take this class with this prof if you can. His assignment requirements are not in one single place, they are scattered online and in documents. He says over and over again that he does not give an A easily and then does not grade your assignment for  month after you turn it i",0
"Great teacher!!! The Holocaust class was SO interesting, and I really enjoyed reading the books he assigned, along with the films we watched in class. Tests are easy, straight forward, true-false questions. Loved this class and I highly recommend it.",1
"Nice teacher but his lecture is boring. Study hard, he test EVERYWHERE!!!",0
Boring. Forces participation during lecture instead of teaching the class.,0
"I'll put it simply: avoid at all costs. I don't like being critical of teachers cause I can't imagine it's a very easy job, but this was the worst class I've ever taken. It's probably due to the fact that we've transitioned online, but he has an aid & it's been almost a year now - it should have been better organized. Just don't do it.",0
"I am currently taking his class online and I must say he is very helpful. I was so skeptical at first, but he makes sure to email his students to remind us when things are due, and he also sets up virtual lectures before the exams.",1
"He is one the best Creative Writing teachers at UCF. He gives specific feedback that actually is useful on all of your work. Most English teachers at UCF like certain genres, and if you don't write in their style, you don't get a good grade. However, Prof. Telep accepts all work and really focuses on craft over genre.",1
"Absolutely does not care about her students actually learning or succeeding. The literature is great and definitely facilitates good discussion. If you take this class, take it with a different professor.",0
"Professor Doonan is very intelligent, responsible, fair and most important he teaches very well. He makes Anthropology attractive and approachable. I enjoyed every class and eventually learned a great deal. Trust him and be sincere to learn because he cares and will guide you through...",1
She is really nice and always willing to help!,1
"I took his Oceanography class through ITV, he's very generous with his grading scale. He grades on a curve and provides 40 points of extra credit to help boost either a bad score on a exam or missing assignments. The exams and the quizzes are based on the study guide book. Easy A if you try and do the work. Highly recommendable.",1
"Lois is great.Passionate about the subject, and invites you to think about things differently. Yes, many think the class is disorganized in topic, but Politics touches everything in our lives and is messy. If you do the work, ask questions, and participate, you'll do fine.",1
"I took Women and Religious Traditions with her last term and the class was seriously boring. I should have seen the warning signs: the class only had 9 students on a good day. One time she invited a guest speaker who did not seem to have prepared for the class at all. Also, honestly, I felt like a lot of the material taught was slightly made up.",0
Mr Woods is a very good instructor.  He gives great feed back on papers and allows you to be able to receive the best grade if you just listen to his advice.  I would take over and over again.,1
His way or the highway.  Not my way.,0
"I was very excited to have Rachael as a teacher due to all the good things people say about her. However, she is completely unorganized, expects participation but doesn't give engaging lectures or ask good questions and then blames it on the students. BUT 505 is insanely easy course with her.",0
"Please avoid if u can. You will dread coming to the class, and then leave gaining no knowledge. Waste of time & money to say the least.",0
Horrible Teacher. Very boring lectures making it very difficult to pay attention. No enthusiasm when teaching and just reads off Powerpoint slides that I could read online.,0
"She favors people, so becareful. Participation is mandatory. She favors through participation.",0
Exam questions are ridiculously specific,0
My favorite teacher this semester! He is hilarious and made me absolutely LOVE Econ! TAKE HIM! He genuinely cares about his students and holds review sessions before all his exams. He made me laugh out loud every class but also taught me so much! Highly recommend this professor.,1
"Ouyang is nice, but a really difficult professor.  He reads straight off the slides, offers no real explanations, and the project work is insanely difficult.  If you take this course, pair yourself up with someone strong in accounting, especially if your new to the topic.",0
"Horribly unclear on grading and during lectures. Grades papers based solely on what he likes, not on how well the papers are really written.",0
Very hard class and not useful. The pro is talking nonsense.,0
"Great lecturer for a difficult subject (don't worry, it's way better than PHYS122). The demos are super important to pay attention to and you should definitely at least skim through the textbook before lectures.",1
I wouldn't suggest taking this class unless you already have a bit of background in neurobiology and are highly interested in the topic. It's not a good class for people who still need introductory neuro. The class isn't well structured and the prof assumes everyone knows more than they sometimes do,0
"This class can change you as a person. Maybe a more stressed out person but a better historian. A class worth taking no matter your major if you're able to put in the time and effort, which it requires a lot of. Of course, there are times when there is slack but don't you dare let your guard down to this class or you'll read 300 pages in one night.",1
Terry is great! I had her for PSYC 395 as well. She is one of the most straightforward professors you'll ever have! Guidelines and expectations are super clear and she is quick to respond to emails.,1
"Dont take her, worst prof ever. She single handedly ruined my GPA even though I put most of effort in her class.",0
"Professor Wood is one of the few math teachers that I've actually learned from. She is a specific grader but only to teach students the proper way to solve equations and inequalities. If use utilize the workshops she generously sets up in combination of attending class, doing assignments on time and engage you'll only be set to succeed! 10/10",1
"Excellent professor, makes a dull subject enjoyable.  He has a great grasp of the subject and is good at explaining it, if you don't get it, he will assist you until you do.  Would take him again!  Should seek help for his M&M, Oreo and Krispy Kreme additions :)",1
"One of the most disorganized and arrogant professors I've met. His lectures are riddled with errors, and he lets assignments pile up at the end of the semester rather than posting them on time. Prepare for busywork and inexplicable mispronunciations of ""parallel,"" ""semaphore,"" and ""ASCII."" N.I. and Microchip must love his shameless sales pitches.",0
He's a nice man and tries to make class interesting but his tests are ridiculous and with his accent he can be very hard to understand. He does try and help you out if you ask but he's not very approachable. I would avoid this class if at all possible though because his tests are extremely hard.You almost need to be a geologist to pass them!,1
"Pros: Let us pick between a group project or a term paper Cons: Has no charisma and was the only class I've ever taken where I looked at the clock every 10 minutes, only read from textbook, took attendance marks, often got sidetracked during lectures I wouldn't take again, that's how boring this class was. Marks fairly so just study the text 2pass.",0
"She's honestly not a great professor. I took her for almost every class she taught at Siena and I had to teach myself most of the time. She talks down to you if you don;t understand stuff right away, but she's a really nice lady. Super gossipy. Be careful what you say in front of her. The whole chemistry department will know.",0
Great professor! Explains material in a way I could understand. Very patient and fair. As long as you do the work you will pass the class. ,1
Excellent course and professor. He engages the students. Class participation is required. Most lectures are mandatory (grades for attendance). Utilize the Bethune Writing Labs when writing the essays required for this course in order to obtain the maximum mark. Lots of reading. About 3000 words total in essay writings.,1
"Class was absolutely unbearable, he did nothing but read off of power point every single day in class, by far one of the most boring things I have ever done, I dreaded going to it every day.",0
"Professor Taylor is very knowledgable and it is obvious he enjoys teaching. He is easily accessible outside of class and willing to help. Midterms and exams were fair, as is his grading. A portion of your final grade is based off of attendance and class participation. Pay attention in class and stay on top of readings and you'll do well.",1
"I love Dr. Polster! Her class is hard but it is so much fun. She wants everyone to do well and learn German, and she will do everything in her power to help you succeed. As long as you keep up with homework and go to class you will do well. Don't let the other reviews complaining about homework scare you, she is an amazing teacher.",1
"Taking him for History of Rock 'n' Roll, seems pretty passionate about it. really tries to make you think more into the music not just by the lyrics, but by what the Artist was thinking when the song was composed..",1
"Prof Gutteridge is 'old school', believing university's purpose is the exchange of ideas, not a commodity to help you get a job. He re-ignited my faith in education and interest in literature. Not afraid to set high standards for attendance, note-taking, and original thinking. UFV is lucky to have him on their faculty.",1
She was very helpful and wanted everyone to succeed. We were able to complete all of our modules early. She responded to emails pretty quickly. I would most definitely recommend her. I took her for a 5 week course and would do it all over again. Do the work and youll pass with an A !,1
"He is really good. However, he makes the toughest test and quizes. Questions are crazy. We have quizes every week. Tests are on Saturday.",0
Dr. Eck is an amazing professor and really knows what she is talking about. She made the lectures interesting and wasn't afraid to ask the class questions either. There is a decent amount of readings but you need to do them in order to pass the tests. You also might get by skipping one or two classes but the tests are also based off of lecture.,1
Coolness,1
I loooved this class and I am sooo thankful for this professor. He used the class participation grade to round UP my class from a B to an A and that was the difference of me getting into UF!!! I reccomend his class.,1
Great professor for what could have been a nightmare class but was not because of her teaching methods!,1
"I really enjoyed his classes. Hes silly and caring. The bonus marks from quizzes are exciting to get since not a lot of college professors do that. Pay attention, show up early, do not slack off, listen to him and youll get a high mark. Effort pays off.",1
Incredible teach. I have nothing but respect for this guy. I definitely recommend him.,1
He has an accent. He assignments homework which is not for a grade but instead to help you understand him. He will have quizzes every week so do the homework. He also sends a practice exam before each exam it is recommended you do it because the exams are just alike,1
"Words cannot describe how horrendous this class was. All he does is point at chapter titles in the textbook and then says "" you should be very comfortable with this"" after not even doing one question with us. Labs take 8 hours if you're smart. He makes no sense and then makes fun of you when you ask questions and if your lucky he might answer them",0
"Tough class and tough teacher. Have to memorize his lectures and the book word for word to do well on homeworks and tests. Tests are essay with 5 multiple choice questions. Book is a tough read. Waste of time, do not waste the time and money. Become one of his favorites, otherwise good luck getting a good grade in the class.",0
Matt is  tough grader at first but gives good feedback. His classes are very discussion heavy but sometimes enjoyable. He gave us multiple group project but that could just be for my specific class. He a solid english professor with a good sense of humor. Many papers assigned but they were never over 6 pages.,1
"I definitely didn't dig his lecture style, but his pop quizzes came straight from the homework, and his tests weren't too difficult. Beware of students that say he gives plenty of partial credit, because if anything he does just the opposite. I would definitely enjoy having him again though.",1
He called the feedback insulting in class but he needs to listen to what we are saying. This format is not working for most people. He needs to change his grading scale & curve. Not a bell curve just a normal curve that all other teachers do. My last chem teacher added 5% to each test but he waited to announce it until the final. He should do that.,0
Wonderful teacher that provides a comfortable classroom setting to learn.  You need to put forth a lot of effort to learn the material but he outlines and explains everything in the easiest way possible!,1
The class is very irrelavent to English and Literature and the professor also uses biases in his teachings and towards students. The class is very boring.,0
"Loved him. I took him during the corona semester of Fall 2020. OChem is tough, but he makes it doable. Don't need the textbook but it helps. Make sure to do old. practice tests as those resemble the real thing and look at the rules of the day resources. Do physical synthesis practice problems before Exam 3 and final. Rewatch lectures before tests.",1
"Tough professor, and that's exactly the kind of professor we need for the CE department! His lectures are very strong and he's extremely intelligent. He filters out students who aren't worthy to be engineers. So beware if you plan on taking the easy route, because this professor is no joke!",1
Great guy!!!!Make him know your name so that he will help you after class and even give you some of the answers.  His notes online are the key to his test....also remember ALL of his test lists. Dont need book!,1
The material is irrelevant & idiotic.  It's basically a basic Excel class w a scoop of Access on top.  Pure fluff. Tests are poorly worded & will include examples from class.  Quizzes are copied from text; her time limits guarantee that you have to skim the chapters beforehand.  Project was easy w extra credit.  Tossed book in trash. ,0
"Bill was an excellent teacher, though his class was one I had to work at. Keep up on long, long online quizzes. Discussions requirements are lengthy and strict. I learned more from this class than any other in the last two years. He chose wonderful and interesting material. Great class.",1
This class was one of my first classes at UCSB and it will most likely stand as one of my favorites. Professor Belkin really knows what he's talking about and enjoys the subject. Lectures are necessary b/c of how much he talks about & lots of reading & a 500 word paper a week but it wasn't too bad. Gets involved with class & answers any question.,1
"He was an incredibly nice guy and I feel bad giving him such a bad grade. He was incredibly boring and his lectures were so long. He found a way to make the most simple things complicated. Tests and quizes are a little hard but nothing terrible. Overall, I would not reccomend taking him.",0
"If you have to take a geology, take it with him!! It's easy A class. Not really because of the content but more because he's very organized and explains everything you need to possibly know and gives examples. He rocks!",1
"I do not understand why people say she gives a lot of feedback. I sent her a draft for an essay due in 2 weeks and she said that she cannot give me anymore suggestions. What? Plus, she is a strict grader and gives you a lot of work.   I mean, this is an ENGLISH class, so I do expect some help with ENGLISH and WRITING.  Don't take her, if you can.",0
"Are you kidding me?  This class is awful!  He rambles on about nothing, and grades very arbitrarily on his exams and quizzes.  He won't cover material in the class and expects you to read it (he assigns SO MUCH).  There is no way you can keep up with everything.  Plays favorites and if he can't remember your name your grade is screwed.",0
Very organized with lectures and clearly explains stuff in examples and ties everything together,1
I have had Smith for several classes he is essay and EVERYTHING is open book,1
I took Professor Khans 100A class @SSU and let me tell you... I have had a good experience other than all the homework and reading that I had to do.,1
"Very interesting lecturer, extremely helpful in discussions (as long as you concur with his views - then you are ok in his book...he's impatient and non-sympathetic to others abilities (until someone gets seriously hurt in the field)...he expects everyone to be a ""mountain goat"" like him, and keep up to his pace.",1
"I highly recommend Dr. Sharma's pov and soc welfare course. Reading isn't required due to her power points being based on the book. All assignments are easy and the videos she has us watch were interesting. Lectures can be repetitive but if the whole class participates, it can make it more interesting. Also, she wants her students to participate.",1
"Too hard to pass the test,too difficult to fulfil the assignment.",0
"Gray is like that grandma that you kinda avoid because she pinches your cheeks. If you don't show up to class (attendance stated not mandatory), you will miss the in class assignments and cant make them up. Her tests are easy if you glance at the power point, book, and highschool biology, Mid term is a take home test during spring break. Forum too.",0
"She's a fantastic person, a great writing resource, and is very open to suggestions about the class (my class helped pick next semester's books). However, because tests/participation are the only grades, you NEED to do well on them. Alternate viewpoints are fine as long as you can back them up/they aren't bigoted. I'd love to take her again.",1
If you have to take computer science at USC Upstate I would NOT recommend Mrs. Con. She almost never replies to emails and when she does it is not helpful to you and is rude. She takes this class VERY seriously. She is a very condescending person. STUDY FOR TEST!!! They are incredibly hard.,0
"Worst professor I've ever had. She gives you the book and tells you to teach yourself. She's very smart, and understands what she's talking about; however, if you expect to learn something in class, this isn't the professor for you. She gives you hours on hours of homework on top of letting you learn the course material yourself. ",0
"If this a mandatory course you should take him. The exams are almost identical to the study guides, he only changes the numbers and this is extremely helpful. Practice problems and you will pass. Do not take LaRosa",1
I enjoyed Elliot as a professor. If you attend every class and pay attention the exams won't be too hard. He also provides very clear review guides for each exam which were helpful. And his in class lectures are usually entertaining,1
Shes DOES NOT put grades online at all. She said she isnt going to.. maybe once we switch to canvas. Do the quizzes before the tests to get an A,1
Wasted class time on random presentations and then would tell us to read 7 chapters for the exam. When I took the exam that material was not on it.I felt I was wasting my time in her agonizing 3 hour class. Weekly assignments and annoying group project. I still don't know where I stand in the class and I graduate in 2 weeks. Please do not take her.,0
"He was a great professor, when going to class if you had difficulty he further explained it. A easy A ,just do the work if have any question ask him and he has no problem explaining what he wants done for the assignment. I would definitely take him again for another class.",1
Useless class full of busy work. Late grading.,0
"Do yourself a favor and take ANTH232. One of the best classes I've taken. Very easy and you get to learn a lot of interesting material and talk to people you normally wouldn't. Neitzel can be annoying, and the class is discussion based with lots of little assignments. For the most part, I really enjoyed it.",1
A really good teacher who is incredibly funny!,1
"His instructions are very, VERY hard to understand. I took this class online and basically had to figure everything out for myself. The assignments are very tedious and require you to work for the grade you want. The quizzes all require you to show work as well.(Ex. one homework assignment took two full days to complete) Don't slack and you'll pass",1
never met a more dedicated professor.,1
"Professor Sabau is the best. He understand and he is a great listener. I truly enjoyed his class. I took him for intermediate algebra and statistics. Im planning on taking him for college algebra. After not being in school for 20 years, I was very scared to take math. I was truly blessed to be in Professor Sabau's class. Easy A.",1
def. the man,1
"Unclear instructions given for projects. She is unwilling to help if you are having difficulty understanding. She taught a color theory class without using color, she would only verbally describe projects. She did not enforce any deadlines, so most students did not have their work done for critiques and she would critique unfinished projects.",0
"Really nice woman, but her tests are impossible and her lectures are very boring. I hope you're good at memorization because it is key to getting a good grade. However, if you hand in papers and participate in class, you should squeak by with a C.",0
"So disorganized. You never have any idea what is happening in the class. It also seems like he is blackboard illiterate, his class page is always a scavenger hunt for what you are looking for. Useless syllabus. You won't have any idea what your grade is until you get it at the end. If you have anxiety, stay away from this prof!!",0
"I don't know how anyone here can call Prof. Manganiello ""well organized"" or ""interesting"". Every class is horribly boring with minimal effort seemingly put into his lectures. He'll talk about basic themes of each work but then leaving you scratching your head as to how it all fits together if you don't sit directly in front of him and ask questions",0
very good intro class,1
"He is a nice guy, but he is not a thorough Prof. Unless you have had some background  in the statics, I would advise you NOT to take him. He didn't offer extra credit and lots of people were confused during his lectures.  ",0
"a perfectionist. he forgets that he has a phD, and we are students. he is way too anal about everything. answers on exam have to hit a ""target"" or else you get NO points. i think he forgets he teaches a 200 level course, not a graduate course. way too hard to be an undergrad prof. i don't like him",0
Outstanding in class and out,1
Dr. Gibson expects way too much. I had her for a 8 week course and she assigns 4 chapters every week that includes 10 assignments each chapter with a 5 page summary for every chapter. She expects the class to be your life. I wouldnt recommend taking her to anyone especially if you have a job or are taking other courses.,0
"I took a French Literature honors class with her and dropped it - after writing an analysis of a quote, she typed people's responses(she knew who wrote what, class did not) on the overhead. She called on me to read mine, and further went on to criticize it in front of the class. I have never been more angered at a professor in my life.",0
Have to go to class because a lot is taught on the computers. Extra credit is given. If you go to class and practice at home before exams you will get an A in the class. Homework is given in advance so you have plenty of time to get ahead. Wright is bland and the class goes slowly but it is an easy A if you show up.,1
"Britten seems to genuinely mean well, but the woman simply wasn't called to teaching. Doesn't actually seem to care and is not particularly engaging. The text is useless but mandatory, and the lectures are meandering and poorly created. She also has far too many guest speakers and decides not to show up on a whim. If at all possible, do not take it",0
A straightforward and easygoing professor who provides a lot of supplementary material. If you're truly committed to this class its not difficult to do well. The labs are a great hands-on experience and the TAs are accessible and helpful. Its much more useful to go to his lectures than read the textbook to prepare for exams and such.,1
"First, she has a hard Asian accent which makes the learning material hard to understand. Second, the homeworks are nothing like the test. The reason being is because the homeworks are based on calculations. But, her test are based on calculations and trick questions. Finally, expect to teach yourself on the material.",0
"I'm glad the notes were taken straight from the book, as going to class is very boring, but that is mostly because computer science is easier to teach yourself. If I could change one thing about him, it would be that he stop singling out random students and asking them questions.",1
"Dr. Schumann is a great professor. His online course was well laid out and very detailed. He offered tons of extra credit. Read the book, view the online lectures, and attend the review for the exams and you should make an easy A. My only complaint would be the guest lecturer for a few weeks. No where near as good or detailed as Dr. Schumann.",1
"Absolutely horrible teacher. He never wanted to help people, nor did he ever explain things well enough. I was always good at math, however i barely got an average of a C in his class because he taught everything BACKWARDS from what normal people are taught in his classes.IF you miss class, and you're not on your death bed he doesnt care the excuse",0
"TAKE THIS CLASS!! She is one of the nicest professors on campus, she genuinely cares about all of her students and about how she can make the content relatable to them. There are clear expectations are set at the start of the semester and if you put effort into your speeches and tests, which are vocabulary based (gives study guide) you'll do fine.",1
Honestly this class was literally the most demanding class out there so if you have anything to do outside of class dont take this guy. His exams were too long didnt give curves more than 80% of the class dropped. I failed this class took another professor and made an A. He just makes this class confusing af take another prof and let google guide u,0
she was supposed to help student by giving more time in exam but no she don't think this is all new for all of us and should give more time in exams every other prof give atleast 3 hours but she gave 1 and half for more than 50 question which is hard for an average students. hate this prof,0
"Very straight forward and organized with his lecture.  Take good notes on what he says, go to lecture, study your notes before the test, scan the book for vocab and you're all set.  Believe it or not, he will keep you awake at 7:55 am in a dark room.",1
"Any class with Paul will be an easy grade. That said, don't expect to learn much. He is a tenured Prof who has become a little too comfortable in his role. He doesn't out much prep into his classes and is extremely disorganized. Do the assignments, show up for discussion groups (if there are any), and you'll be fine.",0
He is not my kind of teacher.  I regretted to take his course.  Waste my time and it is one of the biggest mistakes I've made. My suggestion is not well worth taking his course.,0
"This professor is genuinely the worst. It is so clear that he does not want his students to succeed. Besides his bad intentions, he also just lacks the ability to teach this class, or probably any classes at all. If you are an incoming second year at Smith and are assigned this prof, I suggest you switch immediately, if possible.",0
The class was hard and boring. I knew I was gonna have a hard time because I didn't really have a interest in world music.,0
TAKE ANOTHER COURSE IF YOU'RE LAZY AND MISS CLASS,1
"worst prof ever. exam and midterms are hard to study for when she uses ""none of the above"" on every single multiple choice...",0
"In terms of actually teaching the class, he's a good teacher. However, his personality is what puts this class out of balance. Just go to class, play, then leave. He doesn't reply to emails and isn't willing to help unless he gets something in return. But if you're just looking to play, just stay on his good side and don't worry about anything else",0
This class is simple. it basically consists like all of his classes. Just do the tests and do the discussions well and you should pass fine. Had no trouble with any of his classes.,1
Prof Klatke is amazing! You def need the book and you will need to read the chapters in order to pass. Her tests can be a little tricky but it's open book so not too bad. She is always willing to help and goes above and beyond for her students. The class material is a little boring but the assignments make it interesting. Take her for sure! ,1
"Just be warned. Beth is a super nice woman, but my time in her class has shown me that she is horrible at explaining assignments and even worse at reminding you whats due. My advice? Get in a class group chat ASAP and for the love of God make a calendar of all the assignment due dates. Itll save your life. God speed.",0
"Boring class, very easy if you put just some effort. Teacher is boring, changes due dates, pretty unclear about assignments and where class meets but the assignments are doable. you have to read a couple plays which i found online so no textbook. exams are easy & you get a study guide. This class & teacher are more annoying but not difficult at all",0
"The content of this class is fine but his grading system is simply awful. It's far too easy to pass but far too difficult to get an A. With surprise test questions, sporadically dispersed (yet heavily weighted)  iclicker questions, and no extra credit I was the only one to actually achieve the score for an A (95) in nearly 250 students. Ridiculous.",0
"I took Armstrong's class for Sociology. He is super opinionated. He puts down everyone, and only ever lectures. He repeats himself a lot, and isn't the most understanding professor. Lots of writing and reading.",0
"Really tough grader, unclear on work on the homework, quiz, and exams. Does like to humiliate you and homework, quiz, exams are different than from the lecture.",0
terrible teacher. tests were too hard and the material on the tests was not covered in lecture. went off on tangents and was 2 weeks behind the whole semester. would not recommend ever!,0
"Lacking of  example, the assignment is nothing about the notes. He talked a lot about the definition. the definition is useless. He thought he is a good teacher, you know....",0
"first off,he uses an external site that is totally separate from etudes. I'm sure if you do every assignment he will pass you but keeping up/keeping track/keeping interest is difficult when he uses this ridiculous website. What is so wrong with etudes anyway? why do we have to pay for some external sight that makes everything much more confusing",0
He is quite unclear about his directions and about feedback.  Very easygoing person.  Very few class meetings...most work done on own.  Very expensive art class.,0
"In ProgI I got some of the best advice from Hammerand: if you can't get the problem to work on paper, then you can't expect it to work on the computer. Most problems arise from coding a problem from scratch then not knowing why it fails. Also, comments are VERY important. Sometimes he's rather hard to find. Snag him immediately if you see him!",1
"im not a chemistry person, got B's in highschool. His class made it fun, and easy to learn. Got an A and held it through the semester. The practice exams are same as tests.",1
"This was a hard class for me, but he helped me whenever I needed help.  Other math dep. profs are way weirder",1
She's a very sweet person who will go out of her way to help her students. She has even helped me with another Italian course. She is also quick to respond to emails and is very clear in answering questions. She is defintely the best prof I've ever had.,1
"If you want to be ""taught"" by someone who's in love with her so-called education in feminine and gender studies and makes everything in class about that, you'll love her! She's all about politics and her personal social agenda. Disagree and and she resorts to threats. Technically vacuous, so learning degenerated to self-study. Worst in my lifetime.",0
"Great prof! I enjoy his class, and humor. If you like the office and 24, you will get along great. Tests were moderately difficult, study hard and you do fine. I got an A.",1
"Disorganized, unclear, and just a straight up terrible teacher.  She is inconsistent in her teaching and will not listen to you.  She does not understand english or something. I was extremely disappointed in this class. The whole class dreads going.  STAY AWAY!!!! Wait a semester if she is your only option.",0
"Rhonda is not the most organized prof. Also, her lectures are already pre-made before the semester starts and it's your job to read them before the midterm. There are weekly class discussions. Each week, a group of students present their project and everyone discusses for a week. She is not an easy marker so pay attention to her requirements.",0
"Definitely one of my favourite teachers I've had. He gives you many chances to turn in late work, but I wouldn't recommend waiting since it does add up quick. I also took the lab class so that probably helped me understand but he was able to make the information fun and interesting and he is just an overall nice person. I wish he taught more :)",1
"Mrs. Thrasher is a very nice lady. Her class is very laid back and easy. My only complaint is that her class can get a tad dull, but other than that, she's great!",1
"A big mistake taking this teacher. Diffucult teacher whose personality is worse than her teaching abilities...that's saying a lot. I can't say I know one student that like's her...She's rude, mean, biased, arrogant, thinks of herself as a great intellectual, and is overall full of hoarse crap. Reading and writing intensive.",0
"If the man were any closer to Musical Perfection he'd have to be God! Hands down the most incredible musician I've ever known. He's not easy, he's got high expectations, and you'll do anything to meet them. He's the best.",1
"He's probably not the worst prof you'll ever have, but avoid him if you can. Not a strong lecturer; which is a shame considering that he's very knowledgeable on the subject matter, but conveys that knowledge poorly.",0
"I took this class to fulfill my IGETC requirement. I thought it would be a straight forward and easy class, but now I find myself lost and behind. I feel like she needs to restructure the course to fit it into the scheduled class time (she very often goes over) and have lectures that clearly highlight the ideas that she expects us to know.",0
"I Had Jon for a Calc 2 TA and felt obligated to write this when I saw a bad review. Jon has been the best TA I have ever had at UConn. Very clear, very knowledgeable, and very fair. He is great at explaining both concepts and problems. If I could have him for all my classes I would. If you have the option, take his class, you won't regret it.",1
"Prepare to fail your first paper; it's inevitable. But don't worry. As long as you put in A LOT of effort and participate frequently, you can do well in his class. By no means is his class easy, and you really might hate it while you have it; however, if you stick with it, Walsh will single handedly make you a much smarter human.",1
"Dr. Byerwalter is one of the best prof's I've ever had. I've taken all the classes she teaches. You show up, do the work, you'll pass no problem. She has clear guidelines and timelines for the course. Tests are multiple choice usually 50 ?s and NO CUMMULATIVE FINAL!",1
"i do not understand how she has 100% rate on taking her again as a professor. She is very tough and treats her students like they do not know anything. Only she does. Honestly, she can be rude at times. Her material is hard and overwhelming. You must come home and teach yourself the chapter because all she does is talk about her stories.",0
He was great! Class was C++ online. We had to attend lecture virtually twice a week. He understood if you had to miss and had many resources including extra videos as well as recorded lectures on the topics being covered. Answered all questions asked and very helpful when students needed more help. One of the best professors I have had no doubt.,1
"Gans is not a bad Professor but she only grades based on 4 exams- she drops the lowest test score. Barely used the textbook (although some information was helpful for better understanding), because the exams were mainly based on the power point slides and WHAT SHE SAYS IN CLASS. I highly recommend a tutor if struggling because that helped me pass!",1
"Fam straight lit like bic , manz only talk to like half the class but he still cool. 10/10 would attend class ",1
"This class was the worst history class I've taken in all my years. She is a nice professor but she NEVER posts grades on blackboard, she doesn't do powerpoints, and her exams are writing only. You must read to pass. If you skip class you will most definitely miss important information.",0
"Not an easy class. Kim is a hit or miss lecturer, but his accent isn't as bad as people make it out to be. His accent isn't the real problem, anyway, but a lack of thought cohesion. Lots of reading that you'll need to complete if you expect to pass the takehome midterm, papers, and in-class final. The takehome midterm was very difficult too.",1
"She's sweet, but lectures fast. The amount of work is OUTRAGIOUS.(Took as refresher, I've taken several A&P classes over the yrs, took this one 7yr ago, earned a B) Exams are NOT what are on the objectives, quizzes dont help w/ lecture exams. DO NOT take if you have other classes or work full time. This class takes 4-6 HOURS every DAY to keep up.",0
"Absolutely horrible at giving feedback. And when asked to give feedback, it is not helpful or specific at all. And only responds to select few discussion posts. her grading does not coincide with her rubric at all also",0
"She is very unclear . She was super disorganized, and was 15-30 minutes late to just about every lecture. When I did badly on an exam and tried to talk to her about it, she was not very understanding. It is possible to do well in her class but it is too much work for anyone who isn't a business major.",0
Her Hybrid class was perfect for me. All you need to do is watch her video lectures (which may be lengthy) and you will do well on the test. Don't bother buying the textbook but you must buy her lecture packet! There's no curve but as long as you watch her lecture videos you will be fine. She really is a great teacher and easy to understand.,1
"One of the most arrogant professors I've ever encountered. Not helpful what so ever, and very condescending. I had a few issues in the course because of a BBLearn error, but said it would be alright and in the end got upset, even though I had outreached to him. I didn't mind the content or the work, it was just his lack of willingness to help.",0
Dr. Hughes is a very complicated teacher. She piles homework as if it is an accelerated course and is not forgiving on assignments. Very judgmental on grading. I am a Sophomore and have had nothing but A's. She is unorganized and unpredictable. This will be my first class I drop out of. She is unresponsive and I regret wasting my time.,0
My favorate professor in UofM. The greatest one I ever met. Hope someday I can follow him to get PhD.,1
Very Smart and Helpfull,1
"He is very arrogant, not approachable at all. He did not post solutions. He refused to regrade exams with partial marks. He made tests extremely hard and did not curve when the grade is about 50%-60%. Many students had to drop. He does not care about his student.",0
"Dr. Evans-Nguyen's class is very difficult. Your grade is 95% tests and 5% homework. He does ALL sample problems for you, does not explain well. ""Review"" sessions are the night before a test and you can't ask what to expect- entire semester is fair game. Never unwrapped book. HW is very time consuming (2-3+ hours/chapter). Very poor experience.",0
"This teacher was unable to relate to the students. When asking questions, he would make you feel stupid, the tutoring lab could not understand why he would choose such hard questions for review sheets, and the only students who did well in his class self taught via book.",0
"Prof Campbell is arrogant and scatterbrained. Obviously smart but can't explain ideas at all. He rambles and makes no sense, I just ended up skipping lectures and studying out of the textbook ... I'd stay away from his classes if possible, never taking him again.",0
"Dave is an all around good guy. I failed last semester, & purposely took him again this semester. As I've gotten older I've realized he's probably the best professor in the business school. He is always willing to help and I should have realized that sooner. I plan on passing this semester because I've actually gone to see him and did the work.",1
"literally the worst thing i've ever experienced. it doesnt matter if you do well all semester, the final and the way the grading is curved will be sure to ruin your GPA. only take this if it's required for your degree, and godspeed.",0
"The textbook he recommends is pretty much useless as it does not relate much at all to practice questions. His lectures only cover around half of the material and can often leave some people in confusion. Without Carleton Math online resource, you might pretty much get lost in this class unless you like to face more challenges.",0
"Well, I'm really not sure why he teaches lib or what the point of that course is...but I still got an A. Really nice guy, and super easy class.",0
He is like a German Morgan Freeman! His voice is awesome! ,1
Corporate Finance,1
Excellent teacher and head of the deparment.  Get this guy.,1
Take him as much as you can. He is very organize and very smart. He offers extra help. Awesome professor.,1
"He is a tough teacher and teaches very tough subject material because it is so foreign. However, if you do the readings, attend class and study; you can get an A. In his class. Also, he is very helpful outside of class and is always willing to negotiate.",1
Got good grades for all three tests given during the semester. By the end he was making us do the same projects as CSC 142. The final was made up of concepts he said would not be on it. Did bad on the final and it dropped my grade down completely. Nice guy but does not know how to answer questions correctly.,0
"Dr. Craft-Fairchild is genuinely interested in your development and success.  She is one of the most empathetic and understanding professors I have had.  She encourages you to think for yourself, and outside the box.  Class is discussion-based, which is great because you don't necessarily HAVE to read the books.",1
Cless is a class act and is very thorough. He surely knows his material and is a great teacher who is willing to go above and beyond for his students. I highly recommend taking this informative class because knowledge is in fact the key.,1
"To be honest, I have no idea why this man hated me so much. I really feel like I deserved an A in this class, but it felt like he did everything in his power to prevent me from getting one. When he graded my papers he would drop me a letter grade for misspelling one or two words. When presenting, I always felt like he was trying to prove me wrong.",0
"Char could be pretty vague on what she wanted, not good with technology either. Make sure you completely follow the graph rules posted on her syllabus. You can turn a lab in early and make corrections before its due which is nice. Some prelab quizzes were annoying but manageable. I think ppl reported her bc she was suddenly nice at the end.",0
"Kind prof (took another class with him in person), and he's knowledgeable about the material. BUT never responds to emails, literally. Also grading criteria for exams is too specific. For online class, you won't be able to reach him and won't see him during exams. Get ready to read!!!",0
"He's very grumpy and rude. More importantly he isn't very helpful at all. His instructions are incredibly vague and he'll fail you for the smallest mistakes. This isn't a learning experience, it's a completely demotivating experience. There isn't a lot to choose from unfortunately, but try and avoid him at all costs.",0
"He knows what he's talking about, but he's hard to understand and the tests are based 100% off what he says in lecture. Don't bother buying the book.",0
Dr. Collins is extremely kind and helpful. He was very open to scheduling appointments with me outside of class and office hours for me to get extra help. He lecture go at a very fair pace and he explains the material extremely thoroughly. One of my favorite things was that he would ask the students questions during class to check our understanding,1
"I loved having professor Saldivar for precalc and calc,is method worked for me and I enjoyed the class. Explains everything, loves the subject, good at not making people feel stupid for questions. Very nice honestly, wish I could have had him for calc2.",1
Avoid unless you know VHDL. Won't assist you past the first part of the project. Everything else is easy but you will only get a C if you can't do the projects. You will not learn anything.,0
"Genuinely good dude.  He is the department head. Can be a bit bland at times, which causes me to lose interest.  His sense of humor will grow on you. Tests are tough, but manageable.",1
"Excellent teacher.  Do the homework, *attempt* to answer the question if he picks on you, and he'll explain the entire problem.  The exam questions are the just about the same as the answers he gives in class.  It's a COLLEGE TAX COURSE, so unless you're a CPA it may be a good idea to actually go to class and study.",1
"He was one of the most helpful professors I had all of last year, and taught a really hard subject. Most of his examples were interesting, making it easier, and he was fairly funny in general. The tests were fairly hard, but that didnt make too much of a difference after all the help he gave. Especially after going to his office hours.",1
Ignores all questions and concerns. Notes are awful.  ,0
NOT RECOMMENDED! there is a ridiculous amount of readings that have nothing to do with political science and she doesnt even go over the readings in klass. She doesnt connect the topic of the class to the course she doesnt even have a topic! she just blabs out for 50 mins!but sure the readings are on the exams!! TAKE ANOTHER PROFESSOR!,0
"When they said the best, i almost laughed. She was, at first, the nicest person ever. I started off stong, and she made me believed that i was doing excellent even at the end. Then when i received a NP i was shocked nun the least. The books were interesting and easy to follow. As a person, she is awesome... as a teacher,Never Again!!!!!!!!!!!",0
"Kim is on the list of the worst professors at UVU, right behind George Hickman and Richard Ivie. This woman is as cold as steel and will dock you points if you breathe wrong in an assignment video, you will very rarely get a 100% on anything. Little to no instruction, busy work and useless teaching. I never used Trello for the project :)",0
"The worst prof I have ever had at Mal. He treats students as imbeciles; Duane is both rude and arrogant. He is very opinionated and I felt his lectures to be exceedingly bias.  He added labs and lectures not outlined on the schedule and made them mandatory, so beware, your class schedule will be much more than anticipated!",0
"Every lecture is like a Ted Talk because the way she lectures is so inspirational and soothing. Five exams, an optional final, and attendance are the only things in the grade book. She splits the exam questions half and half between lecture and textbook. Love her!",1
Dr. Hadavas was a very tough teacher. He would get upset when the class could not answer questions in class. His tests were super hard and cumulative final with 20 questions. Make sure you have at least 4 hours outside of the class to study for his class. Also lazy when it came to helping students.,0
LOVE Dr. Marlow! His personality is definitely out there and made me nervous at first cause he is so hyper and full of energy. 4 major papers. If you go to his office hours he is TREMENDOUS help! Should have done it all year. He is funny and will deff keep you laughing.  I am for sure taking him for any future english class that i can GREAT teacher,1
"David Freed was one of my favorite professors I've ever taken. He is more realistic about the field of journalism than other profs and is motivated by getting you prepared for what it actually takes to succeed in freelance writing. He's tough and demanding, but for me personally that is what I needed. I would take him again.",1
"wow, who would've thought a class called Intro to theatre would require you to experience...*gasp!* THEATRE! how shocking! She's a great woman to work with and a good teacher who KNOWS costumes and you'll learn a lot.",1
"Rogol is a awesome teacher. She does take attendance every day but if you go to the class it can only benefit you. Her class isn't hard, you just have to work for the grade you want to get. Always willing to help you out if you have any questions. Defiantly recommend taking her.",1
Dalmia is pretty great. Her tests and assignments are graded tough however if you go to class and take part in the discussion she will round your grade at the end of the semester. She likes to give you an overall grade that reflects the effort you put into the course and not just the overall result your exams gave you which is awesome.,1
"I honestly believe someone has hurt her. She is paralyzed in fear of her students cheating and has taken multiple extra weird precautions to make sure. If you get below a certain grade, she doesn't count your assignments and instead just gives you a zero for them. The upside is she posts videos of her lectures so you can just fast forward.",0
Very easy but helpful and clear.,1
"He's very easy, heplful, but quite boring. It is eseasy to get A if You go to class, do prastice test, study on notes, asks questions. You don't have read book, just work on his note, you will be fine. His lab is still easy for you, just don't miss class.",1
Doesnt keep up with initial schedule on syllabus,0
"Very repetitive. Gives a ton of bonus opportunities. Expects you to write about a past experience in the present. Makes you learn everyone's name, but then he can't remember their names.",0
Don't take this class online with this professor. The Prof doesn't teach! She simple assigns chapter homework and discussion board postings without any lecture to explain concepts. You basically learn on your own and pay to have someone grade assignments. Worse professor I've ever had!!!!!,0
"You're back in high school with Rankin. Does not help you at all, just says it's test material and she can't comment on it, even though it's in class and not an exam day. The Lab skill training taught me way more than she did, it's pretty easy if you just do the lab assignments a couple of times. Would NEVER recommend Rankin to anyone.",0
Love Dr. B! She's such a cool and fun lady! She LOVES what she teaches and it shows. She wants everyone to do well in her class and is always willing to help. Get to know her! It's worth the time!,1
"Sayings of Buddah should be called The Sayings of Bradford. Incredibly arrogant, tells you you're WRONG if you disagree with his positions. Thinks he IS the Buddah. Wish I never signed up for his class. Creepy guy.",0
"This class is very important so please take a different professor. I think she has great intentions and seems very sweet but it is extremely hard to learn with her teaching style. The concepts are difficult and she is not able to teach them in a way students can understand, despite her best effort. Tests are very hard and she does take attendance.",0
"gives a bunch of Xc but he is the worst communicator i have ever had, his assignments often make no sense and the students ends up asking questions for most of the class and his answers STILL do not clarify what he wants. He will get in a zone and talk to the whiteboard while writing but stands in front of everything he writes so u cant read it",0
Let me put it to you this way. Do not follow the happy faces associated with this teacher's ratings. Misleading. This is a man who displays favoritism early on in each semester. Your grade outcome is predetermined the first two weeks of class. Does not focus on Axonometrics as needed for Vis.com.Do not take him.Unfair and always taking class breaks,0
"Good prof.  Very helpful - unfortunately cp216 curriculum is for beginning n00bs.  If you want to learn something, show him your electronics idea and he'll show you things beyond curriculum.",1
"He doesn't read the lab reports. As long as you hand something in, you'll get 100%. No attendance policy, and before each exam you get a takehome quiz which he gives you the answers to, and the exam has almost the exact same questions (and you can use a sheet of notes during exams). You won't learn anything in this joke of a class.",0
"Great teacher overall. Clearly he is very interested in the students. The class section on****is VERY graphic, but eye opening. Do the readings, participate in class, and ask questions! Overall a very interesting and moving class!",1
"She will make sure that you fail the course. She's the worst prof in Sheridan. She gave 80% of the class academic integrity for copying the textbook during the midterm exam. if you name isn't a white person name and if you asked a question, she will skip your question and will move on. She makes the course HARD and gives earrape during online clas",0
he is an awesome guy,1
"They're great men then there's Gordon Lee. Absolutely amazing, it's impossible to regret taking a course with him. He is an experience, a full on experience",1
Dr. Britton is one of the best at KU! Her passion for her field of work is displayed through her lectures and her excitement is contagious.  ,1
Really a horrible instructor for math 95 and higher. She does not know the materials for any of this math class. Really rude in class and yells at students when she made the mistakes. Her office hours are really late and when students goes to her office hours for help. She sleeps in her office hours and yells at students for no reason for material.,0
Lectures are really dry but you're forced to sit through them bc of the daily quiz. And there's no room for partial credit on the quizzes or tests so it's an all or nothing situation. Expect to put in a lot of hours if you're not good at probability concepts. Don't skimp on the hws and actually learn from them since they're super helpful for tests.,0
Awesome prof!!,1
Honestly one of the worst professors at UW. He teaches jazz as if everyone present is majoring in music. This is by far the hardest 100-level class I have taken. There is no panapto and the random lecture information pops up on exams. First midterm was memorize 34 songs and understand 11 chapters of information. Good luck if you plan to take this.,0
"I was not looking forward to this class but she made it bearable. She was very nice, fair marker, made you feel comfortable and always willing to help you out. I loved her! Too bad she doesn't teach anything in English!",1
Mark was disrespectful to his students and wanted to talk more about what he wanted to talk about then let the students talk for themselves. He would force students to talk in class and was kind of rude and pushy at times. He either liked you or he didn't and it showed. I felt like his class was way too hard and that he was too hard on us.,0
the worst prof ever!!!He knows nothing!,0
"I loved her lab and found her to be a super great instructor. If you were stuck, she'd help out until you got it.",1
"Professor Marin is such a sweet and overall wonderful person; however, she forgets what she has or has not assigned and assumes that everyone already knows ASL. Since I grew up signing, the class was an easy A, but for the students who had never taken ASL before, they barely or did not pass at all. Don't take this class if you do not know ASL!",0
"Great guy, and super caring about his students. Truly, wants them to learn. However, this class is by the far the most unorganized class I have ever taken. There is a total disconnect between the profesor and the TA's. Furthermore there is no textbook, but an online wiki book from the University of Maryland. Readings often unrelated to class.",0
"He is a great professor. Vey hilarious sometimes with the way he teaches, but overall he is awesome. Attendance isn't mandatory but missing one class can really mess up your notes. As long as you read the novels he assign (even though some are depressing as hell) and memorize the identifications he gives on the study guide, this class is a breeze.",1
Love Dr. Walker. Great prof and the most off the wall dry sense of humor. You will learn tons in his classes. Broadcast media is a great one to do with him. He really knows his stuff.,1
"If monotones and boring lectures aren't your cup of tea I wouldn't recommend this professor. He is nice and his classes are interesting but the 3 hours of lecture are hard to stay awake in. Attendance is a must, and there are 2 roll sheets so you can't skip, homework is easy otherwise just be prepared to feel like you're in high school again.",1
"Very poor experience in her online class. She took a week to respond to emails, posted an exam ten hours later than promised, and tested us on very obscure details from our course notes. The final assignment (worth 25% of our final grade) was based on calculations about mining that we had never been taught in the course. Would not recommend.",0
"Shes a nice professor, but made the whole class so mad by not posting a single grade all semester. No body knew their grade until she officially posted it on peoplesoft. I still dont know what I got on my final. All I know is that I got a C. She makes us purchase all these books but never discusses them in class. She is such a harsh grader too.",0
Easily the WORST teacher ive ever had in my ENTIRE academic career. Avoid Chuck.,0
I love this class! She is an amazing person and professor. People are just complaing because they aren't able to use their phone.. 50 minutes without using your phone. How dreadful. Her passion for the environment and sea turtles is amazing. Would recommend her to everyone!,1
This class was SUPER easy if you went to CLASS! I took him over the summer term (5 weeks) and I didn't miss one class and was only late for one class. There are only two exams so you have no room to mess up. Take extremely good notes and record his lectures if you can't write fast. I relied more on his lectures than the book. He's really funny!,1
"She is very rude if you ask questions and does not make herself approachable at all. She's a tough grader, but very knowledgeable about the class! also makes lectures hard to understand and they are very unorganized. don't take this class unless you absolutely have to.",0
"His slides are pretty heavy, lots of information on them will be needed for your final project! He has pop quizzes at least once a week and takes attendance that will have an affect on your final grade. His grading rubric is very complicated to understand, make sure to go over it multiple times before starting your papers. Also strict on grammar.",1
"Great teacher! Very inspirational and fun! She's super-fast when you email or text her. She even does grade drops at the end. Tests and quizzes are pretty easy because you can use your book or notes at home. She helped me overcome my fears with fun and simple stuff in class. I got an A, so I recommend.",1
"The top ISOM professor at Mason. Took him for MIS310 and his lectures are organized and clear. He is responsive by email. Homework, quizzes and exams are challenging, but As long as you attend the class and read the slides, you will get a good grade. Lectures are interesting. There's a quiz before every class to be well prepared for the lecture. In",1
This teacher isn't the best teacher to take a class with. He has a very thick accent that you can't understand what he's saying at all. He does however doesn't give you a lot of homework but you won't understand how he grades. You have to purchase his book that he made because there's a code in the book to access your homework and it's hard to read,0
Dr. Nelson is the best professor in the college of business. All of his upper level courses consist of student presentations for the whole semester. These are not hard but very informative and Dr. Nelson is interacting the whole time with great insights. He is one of the smartest most experienced people you will ever meet.,1
"Not a hard class when it came to subject matter, but the semester-long group project she assigned was ridiculous. Impossible to coordinate, instructions for the group assignments were very unclear, and she didn't care about our life outside her classroom, making us complete endless hours of outside work. Have a job or taking other classes? AVOID.",1
Takes weeks to go over one chapter then when its time from an exam he crams things and tells your read the textbook. dont take his class,0
"I did the readings, sat through the monotonous lectures, and put effort into my essays. What killed me was my mark seemed to be based on my verbal participation in class. Due to a condition, I found it tough to speak up, so I tried to visit him during office hours. He gave me 5 minutes a week. Worst mark I've ever had. Still graduated with honours.",0
"Doesn't really teach the material. Assignments, labs, and notes have been the same since 2009 (they are all dated for 2009). Easy to do well in the class but test and assignment questions seem like they are randomly selected. Gives everyone an extra 10% on the midterm as well. The class is a joke.",0
Don't take his class if you wanna pass or learn something properly. All you gonna hear is his life story throughout his class.,0
"Really lively, funny teacher, although she might not seem like it by looking at her.  Once she starts speaking you can tell she really loves the subject and she made the class very interesting.  Had to use the book a lot for studying.  The class had very interesting topics as well.",1
"After seeing how high her rating is I am now skeptical about the accuracy of ratemyprofessors. Not good at explaining at all, impossible to learn from.",0
"Save your time -- this teacher likes the sound of his own voice. Tiresome, but astounded at how this guy takes fun material and dulls it, chews on it without tasting a thing, it seems. As tedious as a twice told tale.",0
"To excel in this class, you must learn pointers, arrays and char*. The assignment grading rubrics are very clear--just make sure your output matches robo-grader. The lecture notes are cryptic and require multiple close readings. The Deitel book was not helpful.",0
I DIDNT CARE FOR THIS GUY..CLASS IS HARD AND SO ARE TEST.VERY HARD TO UNDERSTAND,0
The lectures are boring but that was expected considering it was a Gen Ed bio class.  I always felt aware of what material would be on the tests. There are a few hwk assignments.  He seems like a really nice guy and i would recommend him for the bio 101 class. If you study for the tests you should have no problem passing the class.,1
"His lecture was heavy and did not help my goal to earn from what I've learned in his class. His office hours were a time conflicting with my other class. I asked him to meet at a different time but he refused it. Nothing on the test looked similar to what I've reviewed. Overall, he won't affect me anymore. I will do it better this summer school.",0
Dr. Holgado is an incredible professor. If you show up to every class and you do the work and out in effort she will not let you fail. She genuinely cares about all of her students. She offers TONS of bonus points. She is also always available to help you outside of class if you need it.,1
"His voice is the most monotone and boring thing that will ever insult your ears. I literally can't stay awake during his class. He doesn't grade homework so your grade is solely dependent on quizes and tests,  If you can manage to stay awake in class, the tests and quizes aren't super bad and he holds the class over almost everyday. ",0
"Literally the worst teacher I've ever had in my life. Shes so mean and is not helpful at all, and you cant understand her heavy accent",0
His exams are two essays one of them is 40% and the other 60%. I didn't like this at all because I felt like I had to memorize everything he said and then a week after the exam I wouldn't remember anything. I didn't learn much from this class because of that. The lectures are interesting but his testing method is awful.,1
he is really funny and understanding.,1
"Make sure you sit in front and you talk, you will be given an A.",0
"Aleman is definitely one of the worst professors at JMU. Because of him, I became completely turned off to SCOM. He doesn't use the textbook except for tests, so you have to teach yourself. His ""study guide"" is a sheet of paper saying know every chapter of the book. Not helpful outside of class. He's stuck in his frat boy days. AVOID AT ALL COSTS",0
Prof Lloyd is an eccentric individual I took his physics class and passed without trying very hard. If you go to class regularly and try your best on the quizzes/exams (8 quizzes 4 exams) you'll be okay. Don't skip lecture though because he covers everything you need to know and DO THE HOMEWORK. Those points really add up after a while.,0
"very bad at explaining the material that he presents in the slides and on the board.  Very monotone, and even sitting in the front row, you can almost fall asleep and the class seems like eternity.  If you can do the homeworks 100% then you will do very well on the exam.",0
"Garver is the best professor at USC.  If you have a passion for Music Tech, Garver is the MAN! He literally knows EVERYTHING. I brought him my personal mixes privately after every class and he was always happy to help. If you truly want to be an audio pro, he'll take you there. (BTW took 5 of his classes, Mastering and Mixing were my favorites). ",1
In this particular instance is said about 100 times per lecture. The class is a lot of busy work which can easily be taken care of in class time. Lecture consists of him going over what to highlight in the book that could be on the exam. Its an easy B but youll have to study hard on exams to get an A.,1
Dr. Harris is a nice dude.  Had him for ear training.  It wasn't too hard.  Just do practica musica and practice When you need to.  It doesn't even take that long. just do it. I think people kinda took advantage of the fact that he's nice. or were just way lazy. But I didn't think it was too hard.,1
"Very knowledgable, enthusiastic and current.  Obviously works hard preparing the lectures and demonstrates interest in her students work.",1
"Boring professor. 445 was an awful class, its pretty easy to do well in this class, but I do not recommend this class nor this professor.",0
"He has such a good personality but he is not very good at teaching or grading. He is VERY picky on exams if you miss one little detail he will mark off a bunch of points. He gives no extra credit , he does give another opportunity to retake exams but overall I would suggest not taking his class.",0
"He is a really good teacher. It is important to attend his classes as his in-class examples end up on quizzes and tests. He does a really good job of explaining the concepts. His assessments are very difficult though. Short answers mostly. 5 quizzes, 2 mid-terms, final. He had a lot of homework but that was more to help you grasp concepts.",1
"Atrocious teacher to summarize. She uses COVID-19 as an excuse for her poor performance, but we're all going through the same thing. Awful at communicating and has canceled several classes due to ""tech"" issues. She has not graded one assignment for the semester & is making 500 point essays. She basically does not do her job. Paragon of bad teacher.",0
"The most disturbing teacher with upsetting points of views, it's all about her complaining about how awful movies are and always saying how great she is. Avoid her at all costs.",0
"Dale teaches through helping you find yourself and how that helps you perform as a vocalist. He can always read you like a book, and it makes a lot of things clear. Amazing instructor!",1
"Very confusing class with second life online component. He is very pretentious when grading and offers little helpful feedback even though he grades way too hard. Also way too much work for this type of class, 0/10.",0
"Professor Cregger is a great overall professor. He replaced all of the essays we would've had to write with clicker questions. He did projects through the semester to cement understanding, and helped with whatever I needed help with. Great professor, and a great guy too.",1
Erin expects us to drop everything for this class. She also gives a very heavy workload with short notice of due dates. Marking takes a long time in her class. She does not seem to care about students and seems annoyed if they do not understand. Participation in class is a must. There is also not enough time to complete midterms or final exams.,0
"Shes an remarkable expert on the Inquisition. Shes also very combative without provocation. For example, she interrupted a question to incorrectly corrected me on a matter of Catholic nomenclature in a chastising way (speaking as a member of Catholic lay ministry, our words were both correct, too!). Class was a weird & disheartening experience",0
He is such a sweat and knowledge professor.,1
Nice and cool!,1
"Each class would be generally connected to a topic - such as argument writing or rhetorical analysis - but the lectures felt like a collection of vague tips instead of a proper lesson. He did not make it explicit what he expected, which made it difficult to get top marks. Not difficult to pass, but literally impossible to get over 90%.",0
"not a bad prof.. his exams are pretty tough but he makes up for it with the free 20 percent alloted to assignments. most exam questions come from the textbook, so READ the book. too much emphasis on the economic aspect for a sociology class.. overall not too bad..has his funny moments.",1
Sucks,0
"THIS CLASS WAS SO HARD!!!! No matter how hard you work, it won't be enough. I would take practice exams and review them and go to tutoring and nothing helped. It's not about effort this class is a hit or miss and it's about luck!",0
"To anyone who sees this; take 322b off track with Dr. Thompson. He is the absolute best! His lectures are crystal clear- he explains everything and leaves no questions unanswered. I got a C+ in 322a but an A in his class. Go to lecture, do problem sets, go to his review session, ask questions, practice material and u will get an A.",1
"Dr. Tonks is the worst professor I have ever had. Terrible lecturer, noticeably unprepared. Writes small, stands in front of what he writes, and starts sentences without finishing them. All of this makes it impossible to take notes. Tests much harder than ACS final. IMPOSSIBLE to reach outside of class, only focused on research, not on students.",0
her class is so easy. if you want to pass with A take her.,1
"Some students need A's in every class, others just want to get there GE's done. If you are the first, then stay away. Take AHTG at BYU, read 100's of pages, do tons of work , and walk a way with your A. If you're cool with an A- or a B then take Lattimer! You'll enjoy every class, watch cool videos, do decent on tests, and pray for the super curve.",1
"EXTREMELY HARD GRADER. Considering your grade is dependant on passing exams, it is a very precarious position to be in. Lectures are monotonous and boring, the lack of engagement makes it difficult to determine what is expected of you and what you are expected to know and gain from the class. Would honestly recommend any other prof in the dept.",0
"Bio bases 1 I loved and thought it wasn't that hard so I figured I'd take Bio Bases 2. Man this class was honestly pretty difficult. For sure do-able but each exam is on 200-300 powerpoint slides. Way more info per exam than Bio Bases 1 or Psych of Human Dev, other classes I've taken with her. Still one of the nicest professors at FAU!",1
Her class was very content heavy and she grades way too harshly. She is a nice person but the class is very difficult.,0
"One of my favorite professors as Ferris; definitely makes hard concepts easy to understand. He goes through the book for you and teaches faster and simpler ways. It is a tough subject so you have to study and do the homework, but he is always there to help you.  Go to the room next to his office and you'll be sure to find a great study group. ",1
Professor Mulvihill was honestly my favorite teacher I've ever had. He makes class interesting with his old stories and relates them to the material. The workload isn't bad and he is extremely understanding. I would definitely take one of his classes in the future.,1
"She once told a student the title to his story was ""wrong."" Really? If your work doesn't have a feminist slant, she grades it more harshly. She gives loads of criticism, none of it constructive. I'm an even keel person, and I wanted to punch her in the face.",0
he likes the beatles...what else is there to say,1
Best Prof ever!!!!,1
"Very boring lectures, couldn't pay attention at all mostly because he talks like he's talking to himself and is a slide reader. But answers questions very well.",0
"Professor Donato is the worst professor I've ever had at Bentley or elsewhere. Most lectures in class end up not being related properly to assignments and exams. take home exams can take 6+ hours to complete, prompts for assignments are crazy vague, and he will give mediocre grades for exemplary work. Bad professor makes a good course bad DONT TAKE",0
"He focuses on the text book for everything. Doesn't like to be wrong, he's always right because ""he's a professional"". I thought I was doing great and expected a b+ ended up with a C!!!!! he sure is a tough grader. Expects for you to be working on his class all the time.",0
"This is my favorite professor I've ever had. I declared my history minor because of him. There are 3 papers in the class, which are extensive. A few extra assignments here and there but the papers are really the grade. His lectures really help with writing the papers and understanding the material. I would 100% take him again and always recommend.",1
"Yo...I straight up woke up at 6 AM and wrote 2 4 page papers for her.  I went to her office AFTER CLASS at 2 PM, handed them in, and said ""Sorry, I Procrastinated.""  She said ""Do you work well under pressure.""  I said, ""Yeah.""",1
"weekly quizzes with poorly written questions and expects detailed short answers but only allows you one sentence to answer. does not respond to emails and when he does, he is very rude and short with you. boring lectures that are just summaries of readings so there is no need to show up to class but he requires it in participation grade.",0
I could hardly understand what he was saying or talking about during lectures it often felt like he was off topic and I did not learn much in this class. I had to teach myself everything outside of class. You wrote 3 papers and so multiple quizzes and 1 group project. The midterm and final are all handwritten.,0
"Best professor you will ever have, will literally change your life and your outlook on it and society and how it was formed. Take him for any class you possibly can, it will be the best class you ever take. You will gain more useful knowledge in this class than any other and will be a more well informed member of society. Best influence of my life.",1
"it is just impossible to learn something in the class. He explains some advanced stuff though that might be interesting for some. But if you're looking for a good mark, the book and lecture slides will get you an A.",0
Poor response to questions. Not very helpful and a very self taught class.,0
"Gave me a C and somehow I was happy about it.  Loved the class, hated the subject",1
"Professor Snyder is an alright professor. She is quiet during lecture so sitting near the front is a must. Her style is writing on the whiteboard through lecture which I dont mind. However, I do find her to be aloof and unapproachable. She doesnt really answer students questions and dismisses them, which I find problematic.",0
Persuaded me to drop the class even though I was clear in fundamentals and had internship experience in solidworks. Very rude if doubts are asked more than twice. Gets easily annoyed. Never guides you towards your career. Monotonous and easily lulls you to sleep. Seems like he has no interest and enthusiasm in passing the knowledge and educating.,0
"Mulvihill is the BEST. Had him for 3 courses - Intro, Corrections, and Capstone. He absolutely knows his stuff and does a good job teaching it. His tests/quizzes/papers aren't too difficult - just pay attention and you'll be fine. He also tells the funniest stories!",1
"Great prof, she really cares about your understanding of the course. Very clear and helpful. The material is relatively easy compared to other CS courses, however, it's not very applicable :P",1
"Took this course as a birdcourse but it was NOT because of the prof. The course content was SO easy but the exams and MARKING was UNFAIR. I think Natalie would be a better prof if this wasn't an online course, she was helpful during the ""field trip"" but was so hard to reach through email. The quizzes, test, and field trip really boost ur mark tho!",0
"Overall a good teacher, although the Exams can be tricky they are do-able as long as you study adequately.  She knows what she is talking about and is very passionate about her field.",1
He is a great professor and I really enjoyed his class.  Organic chemistry will always be a super hard class no matter what professor you have but Dr. Winchester always had a positive attitude and tried his best to make it fun.  I loved his class as much as I could ever love a chemistry course.,1
you will learn more than your grade shows but hes a funny guy,1
"Teacher is fair in grading.  Some homework collected, 3 tests, and a BIG group project.  Her notes aren't very clear even if you listen so the text is a must.",0
"he's very clear about course material, but not about grades and expectations",1
"You will have to read 3 novels, 1 short story, and other passages or poems. Two essays on two of the novels, and 4 short essays on another novel and some other short stories. Overall, if you read the material beforehand and write a decent, coherent, detailed response, you will have no trouble getting an A.",1
All I have to say is eh. Its an okay class. If you can remember stuff and like to read then youll pass. Everything is straight from the textbook.,1
Dr. Betts is an extremely energetic and helpful professor. His class is interesting and the topics are too. The questions for the exams come straight from the optional quizzes and the HW from each chapter. Dr. Betts is one of the best professors I have taken.,1
"He is not nice with students. When we ask something, not in the class, but when we're doing the exercises, he is rude.",0
"Really straight forward class that  includes two midterms, one book review, and a final. Exams are multiple choice with one short answer. The study guides she post make studying for the exams super easy. Questions from the readings and inclass videos are on the exams. Doesnt require too much effort to do well.",1
"I cannot say how Dr. King is during in-person classes, hence my rating instead of 2 instead of 1. I can tell he is passionate about the subject for sure, but Dr. King ended up just assigning textbook readings instead of doing much actual teaching, leaving you to teach yourself. Perhaps it'll be different once classes are in-person again. Hard tests",0
So much busy work and prof can't get the system that is used to grace Excel sheets to function properly. So you will end up doing assignments 2 or 3 times to get them to work with the grading system. Instructions on the Challenge questions are completely unclear and often contain mistakes that impact your data yet those are a big % of your grade,0
"I took Activism, Participation, and Protest with Professor Alvarez and I have to say that I am not impressed. I think she lets her personal political opinions get in the way. Her ""lectures"" are confusing and there are way too many group collaborations on the readings. (There are SO many readings). She's a smart person, though, which is nice to see.",0
I was sick for two weeks and he never emailed me back. I asked him so many times for extra help because I wasnt doing well and it wasnt until I was dropping because I was Failing that he did. He basically told me I wasn't ready for this class and it seemed as if he wasn't really willing to help me get on track. Probably the least caring prof ever.,0
difficult class and to be successful you have to do a lot of homework and additional tasks. The professor does his best to explain difficult topics so that it becomes clear. The more you practice the better the exam results.,1
A really fun guy that will not hold you back at all. He's very happy to help you out if you ask him and gives out a good amount of extra credit. A pretty good professor from the classes that I've had with him. He knows the material pretty well and you can go up to him with questions if you have them.,1
"Prof. Meehan is not one of the easiest professors I've had but he is a good one.  Expect a decent amount of work.  Keep up on the readings and come to class to take notes.  His personality rubbed some people the wrong way but he means well and like I said he's a good teacher.  Don't expect an easy A, you have to work for it.",1
"He takes off so many points for little things. Asks the most difficult types of problems on tests and quizzes, while going over only easy ones in class. Stands in front of the problem and does not explain each step. He does not curve, but drops the lowest quiz grade. Make sure you label everything (x-axis, y-axis, points, etc.)",0
"Warning non-Meteorology majors! This class is not a typical 100 Level course. I found the material interesting but  not worth the elective. It's very time consuming (8 to 10 hours a week) reading a text book no interactive teaching. Projects, quizzes & labs very difficult. This was my first and last on-line class.",0
"Avoid her online classes if you can. She just rambles with no visual aids whatsoever. She doesn't answer questions, doesn't post notes, and basically reads the textbook during her lectures. If you need to have her, just read the book.",0
"Dr. Mook is a really funny professor who was really excited about teaching this course and told us. Though his tests were fair, his notes were not enough to prepare us for the tests and quizzes. He drops one test and three quiz grades and i would highly recommend getting past tests which will help anyone prepare for the tests.",1
"Professor Mombourquette was one of the worst professors I had this semester. He never replies to emails (even after multiple attempts) and gives out labs that leave everyone confused. Since the course was online, it seemed like it was every man for themselves and there was no support provided. The class was very disorganized.",0
"Yates is an awesome professor, which helped to make an otherwise dull subject interesting. His Britich accent was so funny and his laidback attitude made the class more relaxed. Class participation is important, but he's very open which makes it easier to talk. I'd recommend him to anyone.",1
Avoid.,0
She is the best Engl teacher.  She explains clearly on essay and very helpful. She tells u what to do to improve your essay. She also very organized,1
Easy A! Show up ready to learn and you will do well!,1
"I took national government with this professor and I can honestly say the people giving poor reviews are mainly doing so based on their grade. His lectures are filled with tons of information- get ready to pay attention. If you don't go to lecture, don't expect to get an A+. He's not bad to listen to, and his lectures tend to be semi interesting",1
"I am about to finish this course in fall 2020, so I took it all online and asynchronous due to COVID. Out of all the classes I'm taking this semester, this is by far my least favorite and most difficult. The entire grade is based off of 4 exams, THATS IT. Unless you really enjoy philosophy or learning about specific philosophers, don't take this.",0
"Paul is a pretty nutty guy, but his class discussions are funny; they're pretty long but still remarkably hilarious.  He is not very clear with instructions, so get the number of a classmate or two to help keep track of everything and get 2nd opinions.  He uses the Wiki heavily and that will be the basis of the info you get for projects.",0
He is amazing! Be careful though when he says that he wants a concise definition he is lying you should expand and say everything you know on the subject of the word he wants you to define and not just give the definition he gave in class. You need to know everythign really well but it is worth it because the lectures are inredibly interesting!,1
Only have 4 in class essays to do and 10 optional experience points. Attendance is mandatory you can not miss one day or your marked down. Also a very hard grader! the average grades are C+ on papers and thats even when you write a thesis with 3 examples and a conclusion with a so what.,0
"very boring, literally fell asleep through all his lectures. If you don't want to spend money to see the two play required for this class forget about taking this course. find another class that isn't so boring.",0
"He is seriously the most unfair grader I've had in college.  His exams test reading comprehension and whether or not you know WHAT he's asking, not whether or not you know the answers and have covered the materials. His TAs are unhelpful as well and if you ever have Kassuhun, your grade is seriously doomed, no matter how much of the work you do.",0
"Was really nervous about taking advanced calculus but he made it really easy to understand. Honestly, not that difficult of a course if you pay attention. He explains concepts really well and although he can be a bit difficult to understand sometimes, he made the course really enjoyable for me. Would highly recommend!",1
"He's frustrating. Clearly knows what he's talking about, and clearly passionate about his material given he's been teaching this course for so long, but his poor English skills translate into both his lectures and his notes, which make them difficult to decipher. He also frequently ignores students who try to answer his questions or ask any too.",0
"This professor is the first I have ever rated. She is the most helpful, kind, and understanding professor. I took this class as fast track (3hr long classes) but she made the time go by really fast.  Really easy projects and she lets you use whatever version of the textbook you find so you don't spend a lot.  Highly recommend her.",1
First of all Professor Anderson was just plain out boring. My roommate was in the class with me and she hated his class too. Second of all he shoves his opinions down your throat. Every example we had in that class was his political opinion. The class had a lot of uninteresting readings to go along with it. I do not recommend this class.,0
"Started off a good class but quicikly went down hill. Not a good summer class! the information was too dense and he expected you to start off on a level that nobody was at. He didn't teach just used the textbook and made students teach part of each class for him. He was a very nice guy though so I will give him that, few good assignments.",0
"Pretty boring guy.  Content was a little dry, but not too bad.  He doesnt really care about his students",0
"absolutely my favorite prof at the university.  He's so nice and is still friendly - years later!  I learned a lot in his courses and he's a genuine ""teacher"".",1
"Do yourself the favor & don't take this class . The midterm and final are based on ""everything we've gone over."" 8 pages , 1 hour without any guidance or real test preparation. He makes his own plans & ideas that don't exist in the real world & expects you to study them. Everything in this class is based off his own opinions and views .",0
INCOMPREHENSIBLE!!!! Heavy accent and he mumbles. He is rude to you in office hours. Avoid at all costs.,0
"Ed is a good person, and easy to communicate with.  However assignment requirements were unclear and since this course was a new course (and required for new students) it may need retooling.  I would take a course with him again.",1
"AMAZING teacher, do not use your phone in class and pay attention. He makes the class interesting.... sometimes goes off topic but there is never a dull moment! He is there to help you any way he can. If I had to pick a favorite teacher at Moorpark College it would be Orbie! ",1
"This class is completely awful. Three papers assigned for a history class is absolutely ridiculous. It's not even about history as much as it is him trying to teach us how to write in useless styles such as Chicago and Turabian, like why?? He always goes back and changes what he wants and there is no real structure. You'll regret taking this class",0
His notes can be confusing. You have to read the book to help get an understanding of the topics. Can't use calculator on tests. Best to try to get a hold of his old tests to help study for the tests. He does curve on the grades.,0
"Pretty easy class.  Doesn't take attendance but it does effect ""Professionalism"" at end of the semester, speak up in class to earn these 250 points too!  Online exercises are a little hard & the class can be boring talking about basic writing skills, i.e. formatting a paper & punctuation/grammer but still recommend for professional writing practice",1
Great teacher who cares about students.,1
"Class is disappointing. Supposed to be a translation class, but time is mostly spent on grammar and vocab. We have to figure it out mostly on our own. She often starts class by yelling at everyone over things that annoy her. Required story book we all purchased has never been opened. No real instruction on translation techniques.",0
"Hes a funny guy & lectures stay entertaining but very detailed & nitpicky with info. Tests are so detailed its almost impossible to get an A. You need to recall everything he says & presents in lectures. Im a 4.0 student, or at least I was until this class. Ill dread having him again.",1
"Prof. Fossett is extremely boring and his lectures are way too hard to follow. I would not recommend taking him, but if you are already in his class and can't transfer out, get tutoring. And ask a lot of questions. I basically had to teach myself from the text book.",0
Amazing teacher. Kit keeps his class relaxed but remains engaging due to his humor and passion.,1
"Most personable prof in Mun, made my year a lot happier... I had him for 1080 and passed but I was sick the next time i had him, he completely understood and was gracious with assignment due dates.. even though I basically dropped all but one of my courses with a doctor's note he was always understanding. Wouldn't have any other prof for enlgish!",1
Cares about students and funny stories,1
"Dont take this teacher, mean and unfair",0
I am a senior getting ready to graduate in March and Professor Bradley is by far my favorite professor thus far. She is engaging and draws class participation from everybody. I only hope they allow her to teach one of my remaining clusters.,1
"Online course, easy, but assignments were boring and ""worksheet-ish."" Almost no communication. Course VERY poorly designed: missing info and instructions, erroneus assignments/dates; she clearly had not gone through the material and had copy/pasted from a previous semester. Grading return time awful (over 6 weeks). Disaster of an online course.",0
"Very funny professor, with a story for every occasion.  I love listening to him.",1
"Spends too much time talking about his own experiences than the course material. Lecture notes not posted til a few days before the test, but aren't very useful since you NEED the book. Doesn't check his email. Made us memorize 34 songs for the first midterm, and didn't even test us on the interesting topics of jazz history.",0
"Honestly I dont think it matters who you have for UP 1 or 2, The way the classes are structured is absolutely terrible. And good luck with the textbook (specifically the math notation, its downright trash) and this is coming from someone in a 400 level math class.",1
Worst teacher I've ever had in my life. Completely useless. Does not know anything about graphic design and is horrible at giving feedback. He belittles his students and finds pleasure in embarrassing them in front of the class. Any good reviews on here were probably written by him.,0
"Disappointed that I had to take soils lecture online, but he made the best of the situation! Dr. Farrish is a very knowledgable man, and you can tell that he cares very much to answer any questions or offer help. The notes are extremely detail-oriented, and the exams, while online, were not easy in the slightest. He grades fast!",1
"She assigns care plans in the form of a ""Health history questionnaire"". Majority of critical thinking ICU, MedSurge, ER nurses will tell you that care plans are time consuming and useless. Yet she assigns them anyway without a care in the world and expects you to write an APA format paper without even a template. Very hard and old way of thinking",0
"Easy marker, easy everything, very friendly and easy to talk to",1
"Great guy, class is very doable as long as you show up to class. Recommend.",1
Beyond boring! she is so unorganized and that stresses you out so much. Worst class ever !,0
"Every test is easy except the first one, and that one screws up your whole grade.  I earned an A with the extra credit he gave, but he never counted it.  He gave me a B and avoided me when I tried to call, e-mail, and visit him during his office hours.  Very rude.  He wears the same clothes every day and wastes our time talking about things that don't matter and telling jokes.  I'm sure he is a good man with good intentions, but I didn't like him.",0
"I highly suggest avoiding this teacher at all costs. You WILL regret taking his class. Terrible at lecturing, makes you feel stupid for asking questions, quiz every single day in class and he only gives you 3-5 minutes to do each quiz, and he can not explain anything to save his life. Also Very judgemental towards his students.",0
"Dr Jasmin is passionate about organic chemistry. He mumbles a little, but he is very clear in his explanations.",1
"I am usually an all A type of student, and I received a B- in this class. The papers she makes you write there is no feedback for and simply gives no points for certain sections often. An extremely hard grader. Exams are very difficult even if you read the textbook and study notes as I did still does not guaranteed you know the info needed.",0
"Professor Boris seems like he is passionate and knowledgable about Philosophy, but I did find it hard to grasp what he was trying to come across most of the time. I also couldn't focus too much because I was constantly writing notes and trying to transcribe all the ideas he would constantly throw around.",0
"Professor Sheridan's lectures are heavy, but really interesting. The notes you take help for all the exams. He provides a detailed study guide for each test and he really cares about people's grades. We read 3 books, 3 exams, and 1 paper. He also uses films in class, which helps understand topics more. He cares a lot and you will definitely learn!",1
"Starts every class with an ""Alllllllriiiight.""  Funny and engaging guy.  Very considerate and helpful.  I passed a paper in a day late and there were no points taken off because I told him it was going to be late.  Show up to class though, he take attendance every class, besides, he might just play his guitar and sing slave spirituals for you!",1
hard,1
"Had him for my first semester of college. If you are a freshman there are so many better professors to teach you calculus. He does an extremely poor job explaining the material, and his homework assignments are close to impossible. I have been good at math all my life, but this professor makes sure to deliver the material in the most complex way.",0
"He is NOT nice at all. I am a student who attends class, but when other students are not there he will verbally degrade them, even when they are not their to stand up for themselves. Literally stated and I quote ""If your reviews of my teaching mattered, I would definitely be out of a job.""",0
"Professor Ramasesh was a mess. Taking his class was a drag and by attending his lectures, I never felt like I grasped any meaningful knowledge. He will call you out during class to answer questions that no one knows the answer to, to get someone else to talk. Does not teach the material well and will be disappointed by the poor scores on his tests.",0
"He's an EXTREMELY tough grader & goes on rants in lecture, yet tests on things that he never mentioned but were referenced in the textbook. The class averages were always F's & D's. He doesn't like confrontation, so don't bother talking to him during office hours or after class, because he gets VERY angry & rude about it. Seems nice at first though",0
"A course everyone should take. She is a wonderful orator, extremely charismatic, and at times, quite funny. Readings are important and reflective of history and today. A very important class. Took it as an elective, will remember it for the rest of my life. 10/10.",1
"Simply focusing in class is hard. It's ALL lecture, he talks fast, writes on the board small. If you're like me and have a hard time seeing, sit up close. I'm approaching the first test and I have no idea what to study because you ONLY get lengthy handouts on Dogmatic Constitution and NO slides or anything. Be in class, force yourself to listen. :(",0
"This is the most difficult class I've ever taken. If you successfully pass the class, it is GUARANTEED that you will learn. I feel like he could explain things better. Every time I went to the tutors, they ALWAYS explained it better and in a way I could understand. He also SLAMS you with busy work. It can definitely affect your other classes. ",0
"He is a super sweet professor and clearly lays out the work for the weeks. Usually consists of a quiz, discussion board, and journal entry. Super easy choice for an art elective and he grades quickly. No group projects. Must use online text since quizzes are embedded in it and it helps with midterm and final. He is older but did well with online.",1
A real gem of a professor. His class was my favorite Gen Ed/Hub Unit so far. A great class if you have decent Bible Knowledge and would like to supplement it.,1
"Be very sure why you are  taking this course. You wont understand anything during the lectures because the language used is purely technical. It was told to me that it will be a very easy going course with a straight forward final exam. However, it was extremely difficult, and the final was completely different from what she asked us to expect.",0
"I took the online class. You definitely have to work but it is not too hard. Manageable for a full time class and work schedule. Everything is due on one day, which makes it nice to chip away at all the assignments throughout the week at your leisure. You do not need a textbook but you will be reading a lot every week.",1
This professor does not interact with students that much. (If you are taking the online version of the class.) There is SO MUCH TEXTBOOK READING. You literally read the ENTIRE textbook during the semester. Take good notes. It will help you on the exams.,1
Dr. B. is a great professor. She really knows the material and really helps you learn it. Read the book. Keep in mind that everyone taking Calc 2 takes the same final no matter who their teacher is.,1
"This class does not reward you for learning the fundamentals of Calculus 3. Instead, you need to learn how to do the homework front and back. Each test and quiz just has problems from the homework. Homework is a weekly 30 problems. Lectures are only good for knowing what content will be on the homework. Taught myself the entire class.",0
"AVOID. AVOID. AVOID. Do chem 204 if necessary. Just all over the place, basically. Lectures are SO unclear. Does NOT explain anything. Basically, learning from his lectures is insanely difficult. Watch lecture recordings, read the text (SO MUCH BETTER) and do practice problems. Maybe you'll survive, but I certainly didnt. #RIPmyGPA",0
"only teacher for 212, but good at what he does. insight provided during lectures really helps with explaining assignments",1
he will ruin your grade,0
"The only way I passed this class was by getting a tutor and that is saying something because I've never needed a math tutor before.  He goes off-topic constantly and students at least once per lecture have to correct his math mistakes.  He is very lenient with giving partial credit, even so many people fail due to his confusing explanations.",0
"Very, very bland. Uses a poorly designed online course, teaching style is ""unique"" to say the least. Get out before its too late.",0
"A great professor if you want to actually understand accounting, not so great if all you want from the class is an A. His lectures are more focused on understanding concepts than solving problems so they won't get you ready for the test. Class is manageable if you do the homework and go to his office hours.  ",1
"Dr. Nicas is a good instructor. He is clear and his tests and very reasonable. His lectures are sometimes dry, so his jokes sometimes fall flat...but he is a very nice guy and is very smart. Great semester.",1
Not as bad as the other reviews say. If you pay attention to the lectures and do the homework the class should be easy. She is helpful and generally knows what she is talking about. Make sure you do not cheat because she will ask you about your code and if you can't answer her questions she will knock points off.,1
"Lectures are not useful, since he only reads from the book and examples are print out. Quizzes and tests questions are exactly like the homework, so I recommend doing the homework early and practice the problems many times. Basically, you learn everything on your own. Get ready for heavy assignments.",1
hard to understand what he expects from your work,0
"Although i can't stand to listen to him s-l-o-w-l-y p-r-o-n-o-u-n-c-e e-v-e-r-y w-o-r-d, he is very nice, and practically throws the marks at you.  A little dedication is all you need to get an A (Practically no chemistry knowledge required!).",0
"Took this class thinking it was gonna be easy but it was the complete opposite. Homework everyday and lectures are long. Make sure you're very specific when it comes to tests, spelling and grammar is important! One big project that includes going to the museum and either doing a hands on project or a report on it. ",1
Basically impossible for some classes. Asks questions throughout the class and will chuckle if you answer wrong. He gives tests that usually are different than that information went over in class. If it is on the same topic he will make the question basically impossible to answer correctly. Short answer questions have to be 100% correct.,0
Final and midterm were much harder than hw. I would just read the textbook and do all hw (as many practice problems as you can). Video lectures and synch meetings didn't help. Freedman seems nice until you ask him a question. Treats his students like they are dumb and a waste of time if they don't understand things right away.,0
"Professor Wright is a great professor. Most things are clear in her class and her lectures are clear. She give out a lot of busy work but for the most part they are easy. She is really accessible outside of the class and holds office hours at multiple times in the day. If you go to class and stay on top of the work, this class is a piece of cake.",1
"Dr. Proga was kind, really passionate about astronomy, wanted students to enjoy learning, and didn't want to make the class stressful. He made funny jokes once in a while and liked to talk to the class conversationally. Easy class since he gives you the exam questions beforehand.",1
"Brunjes really enjoys teaching and wants you to learn, but he isn't very considerate of students who want to pass or are learning a difficult subject for the first time and can't memorize the text in detail. He doesn't use a microphone and there isn't a ppt, just pictures. Beware of exams and study since anything can be a question. Good luck...",0
Honestly one of the worst professors to take for an online course. There's a big group project with three parts and he is extremely unclear in his directions. Hardly replies to emails even though it's an online course and is not helpful at all. Exams are unreasonably difficult. Stay away from this professor.,0
"Doc's pretty tough, but he's been in the game for longer than we've all been alive. He knows what he's doing and how to get the outcome he wants. He tends to pick on the tubas, so be prepared to pay attention and lead time.",1
"Very nice professor. I am an education major and took this for a LA credit. She understands that not everybody is an artist so she is very lenient when she grades. She does have her obvious favorites, but treats all of her students with respect. I actually learned a lot from this class and she helped me a ton since I am not an artist. Take Her!!!",1
Angel on Earth! Changed my life. Favorite professor to date. ,1
Grades are due in 5 days... she hasn't graded anything in over 3 months. You'll be expected to write huge summaries on topics that are barely a paragraph long (usually 3 huge summaries per chapter). She doesn't answer her emails either. She allows rewrites if you want a better grade... too bad she hasn't graded the original paper yet. 4/10,0
"This guy is sort of full of himself. I think he tries to play it off like he is this really humble guy, but then he turns around and subtly talks about all the great things he's done. As for the class, we never stuck to the syllabus, and he loved trying to be controversial, only problem was nobody in our class ever took the bait. Wouldn't recommend",0
"I have had him as a professor every semester at Brockport. He is very understanding as long as you do your work and he sees that you are genuinely trying. You must listen to his advice, otherwise, he will grade you harder until you understand that he gave you an assignment you must do it and follow it. If you struggle tell him and he will help.",1
"Bickerton was an alright prof. I found his lectures to be very boring and dry, and I found him to be a hard marker on papers, midterms, and exams. I don't think I would reccomend taking a class from him. I had him for PSCI 221 and DEVS 202 this year.",0
"Professor Hynie is the most caring, knowledgable, and supportive people at York. Extremely clear expectations. She has so much experience too! I'm not done the course yet, but I'm loving the course with her!!",1
"This dude is awful, has a thick African accent, lacks modern teaching techniques. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS .  Should go back to tutor school. ",0
"His lectures are VERY hard to follow. He just spews massive equations. If you so much as take your eyes off lecture for one second, there's a good chance you won't understand the rest of that lecture. Other than that, he's very nice, and grades nicely, and cares about his students. But sheesh following his lectures is a real hard time.",0
best professor at csub! he is so helpful and caring. his discussions and classes are so life impacting and interesting! definitely recommend to everyone!,1
"I will never take a class with her again. Especially if you ever pointed anything out on her exams, which half of them wrong, or if you ever stood out for yourself. Know that she will make her best to make sure you fail the class or feel humiliated.",0
"he doesn't reply to emails often, but makes the effort if a student is in need of some attention like retaking an exam and such. His notes aren't that organized, made grand mistakes on poppers and deadlines so this is pretty much self taught. College alg is decent, not too hard not too easy either. Just study by yourself honestly.",0
Worst professor ever. His teaching methods are horrible. Do not take him!,0
"Dr. Corral is an outstanding professor who has devoted her life to her students and to Cal-state University. I know her personally and professionally, she exhibits truth and honesty in every aspect of her life. I would recommend her to all.",1
A very strange man but very smart his grading system is had to figure out but he stops taking role after about three weeks going to class seems almost pointless and you really need to read the books that he assigns,0
"Sweet, caring, knowledgeable professor. That being said, her grading was outrageous. Most of the course was spent meeting with your group and little time was spent learning material. There was one exam (most of the class did poorly) and a final paper. Little instruction was given for the paper, yet it was graded incredibly harshly.",1
"You will suffer a lot in this class. Tips to success: his notes are useless, so are the lectures. skip them and borrow the book from the library and start reading from the first day. Do not worry about not being able to solve the assignments, you are not alone. do not be sad for failing the midterm, many students will be in your situation. Good lck",0
"This class is perfect for you if you are a feminist because that is what the majority of the students in this class were.   She is a wonderful teacher, and is very good at remaining unbiased. Her grading is a little weird. A lot of times it seems like she would give completely arbitrary grades. We even got graded on how much we posted on Facebook.",1
He is a very hard teacher to understand. He does not give you a study guide for either the midterm or final and does not tell you what is on either. He just expects you to study everything he's told you in lecture and material you have read. I barely passed with a C and i am an A student. Take a different teacher if you can.,0
A person inflexibly attached to policy without regard to its practicality.,0
"Had Stoffey for Social Psych. You can miss up to 3 classes without an excuse. He's very understanding and cares for his students. Only gives quizzes after every chapter. The quizzes are easy if you study! You also have write-ups to do before the quizzes, but they are easy points! 10/10 recommend. He's a great guy! Taking him again next semester :)",1
I had to choose 1 Star because 0 wasnt an option he is not clear at all and the professor has to many returning students and you would think the college would notice that. He stumbles himself on questions from the textbook and doesnt care if you fail the class or not.,0
"Well on the plus side, grades are very easy. You just watch a few movies, read a little and write about it. However, if you are conservative, this class is not for you.(learned that the hard way myself) Alot of leftist views with no seeing the other side. So if you can deal with that, go for it.",0
Not a very good prof.  Teaches the entire course as a mechanical problem solving course and then tests you on theory on the final instead with true/false and multiple choice.  The exam was not representative of what the entire term of course work actually was.  Not willing to engage with students.,0
The live animal sacrifices really spiced up the class and made me want to come to class a few times. Most of the time I just wanted to stay in bed and eat flaming hot cheetos with my toes.,1
"Don't take unless you want to learn from the book and YouTube. Lectures are barely helpful, overcomplicates the simple things and rushes through the hard parts.",0
"Went to probably 3 classes max the entire semester, got 100 on midterm & final. I left after turning in assignments. Useless lectures, just read the textbook for info. Dont bother putting in a lot of effort on the papers just fulfill the requirements. Pretty insensitive guy, not afraid to kick people out of class for being late or eating.",0
"Best professor I ever had. He cares about you, helps you whenever you are struggling to understand the concept. His quizzes are awesome, he gives you the knowledge of the stuff that is not in the syllabus. He knows his stuff and have great knowledge of Linux.",1
Perfect. Awesome. Fun.,1
"Son enseignement est endormant lors de ses cours. Par contre, elle est trÃ¨s disponible pour rÃ©pondre Ã  des questions Ã  l'extÃ©rieur des heures de classes et est beaucoup mieux de style 1 Ã  1 pour donner des explications. Beaucoup de lectures obligatoires dans le manuel du cours et relativement peu d'Ã©valuations!",1
I took her class because I was slightly interested in literature. I did not have my major declared yet so I was dipping into different courses. If you are not an English major this course/teacher is not for you. She is very critical on how you analyze the text. Classes can be very boring if you do not love literature.,1
"The final exam is tomorrow morning, less than 24 hours away, and we have still not recieved our assignment marks. The course is comprised of a mid-term, assignment and final exam. This is so unprofessional and ridiculous. She has not made any announcement or sent out any email letting us know why we havent received our marks, or apologizing.",0
Took two of his classes and I loved him. He is passionate about the subject and when you show some interest he will help you even more when you have questions. Lots of labs and mini tests that are not too hard. Make sure to go to class because that is his main way of communicating information. One of my favorite university professor.,1
"I really like Mark a lot, but I find that his course content is way too broad. If you are an individual type student, you will excel in any of his classes. If you cannot figure out concepts on your own, and be able to come up with your own content, you will struggle mightily in his class. Be prepared, he gives out a lot of homework each week.",1
"To anyone who is serious about a career in communications, TAKE THIS CLASS. Dowding trains you to be a PR professional. His class is not easy, but you will leave knowing so much more. I came in a good writer, and I left his class an even better writer. Put in the work. Do your assignments. Ask for help. Honestly, truly, he cares about your success.",1
Greatest teacher ever.,1
"My rating may seem harsh and to be truthful, I didn't fully mind the class, but there were some issues. For one, the syllabus schedule was out. We got off topic so much the schedule was no longer relevant. He can also come across as condescending. He makes it very clear when you are ""wrong"" with his mannerisms. Not what I expected out of this guy.",0
"One of the best engineering professors I have had. She lectures at a reasonable pace and does lots of examples, although they sometimes are trivial compared to the online homework (which is frustrating at times). Written homework is fair. She will help you succeed, but you have to put in the time. Would have been nice to have more time on project.",1
"He would probably be good if his accent wasn't so heavy. His midterm is long, he marks tough. The multiple choice on the final are NOT like the things he said will be multiple choice in class! His notes are really condenses and good for learning. His class examples are also really good for learning purposes.",0
"offers a max of 5min office hours. timed quizzes, hw doesnt match the youtube videos he post on weekly canvas, so your own your own relying on classmates for help for all hw cuz he is extremely unreliable and terrible. awful, dont recommend at all unless u dont mind learning on ur own and spending hours asking classmates for help",0
"For a first year class, overly excessive marking, definitely a hard marker. Although I attended all classes, did all the readings, went to tutorials, still did not manage to do as well as I thought in the class. He is clear and organized, but he expects too much for a first year class.",1
"Really funny and interesting lady, but boy, does she ramble. Too many anecdotes, not enough objective facts. Can't really tell you too about archaeology after this class besides DIVA lab, Underwater Maya, and Canada. Good if you just need an elective, awkward if you're an anth major like me. 3 tests, multiple choice, pretty easy w/5 bonus questions",1
"At the beginning of the semester I wasn't a big fan of Bushey, but he has grown on me. This class is very difficult, definitely a flunk out course. But, if you are willing to put in work you can pass. Do not skip class, he moves very quickly and if you aren't paying attention you will miss a lot of material. The tests are hard so definitely study.",1
The single hardest and most rewarding thing I've done at KU. I apply dense feminist theory from this class to real life. We had a group project on human trafficking policies that we literally presented to her personal friend at the Department of State. Brilliant professor and person. My friend cried in her office hours and she was nice about it.,1
Ted de Winter is one of the worst professors at BU. He might know a lot about industry but when his lectures are filled with racism and sexism comments it is hard to take him seriously. Direct quote 'Sexism is not dead. Sexism is good' He also tells the same stories in every class so his humor runs out real quick. Only take the class for the easy A,0
"I don't recommend at all. U will not know about nothing, unless you struggle by your self.",0
"I took her class during summer and it was an easy A. She was my counselor for a meeting today. I have never been belittled so much in my life as I was in that thirty minute meeting. I was told I will never make it to a four year college, and she gave me grief for not memorizing my student id number. I will definitely be reporting her to the school.",0
"Probably the worst professor I've ever had. Her lectures are unclear and not always correct. The majority of her exams are trick questions. She makes her review crazy easy but her exams are hard as hell. She's not a clear lecturer and when she does start saying something important, she mumbles so you have no idea what she's saying. Avoid if you can",0
"Nice guy, horrible prof. Instead of discussing concepts, goes into complex experiments of how they were discovered (of which you'll need to know, and good luck finding that in his notes). Tests on highly specific material that was barely touched on in class. Voice recordings are recommended. Avoid if you can.",0
She will not let you make up anything. Even if someone died and it effected you very much. I do not recommend this professor.,0
"Prof. Qualls is an amazing teacher. He is brilliant and deeply interested in the material. He is a tough grader, but will make you a better writer. One of the best profs at this college, hands down. Take a class with him, regardless of your major, you won't regret it.",1
"Madame Kugler is one of the nicest professors I have ever had. She makes an effort to remember everyone's name and greet everyone at the beginning of class, and she really cares about each student's success. I will warn you that you have to be present and participate to pass, but it is not a hard class, even if you're bad at languages like I am.",1
"Terrible teacher. Very unclear. Even though she is kinda helpful, doesn't know what she is talking about. In all honesty i could teach this class myself better than her",0
One of the best math teachers for math 330. The lab work is a little tough but quizes and exams are easy.,1
"Worst prof ever. Save yourself the time and effort and DO NOT take any course taught by him. I'm an A student, his exams are extremely hard and barely relate to the lectures. You would think that he would be more accommodating and communicative because of the class being taught remotely, but no. Also, the TA is responsive unless it's important.",0
"Would NOT recomend taking this class. Claimed that seeing our grade online was ""unnecessary"" and when asked for one-on-one help, always had an excuse to get out of helping you. It was obvious that even she wasnt very familiar with the material and when asked questions, she would try and avoid the subject. ",0
"Even if you have experience in the real world, this prof wants you to keep responses by the textbook. You think you're giving 100% only to receive a D. Assignment List: 10 Discussions, 3 quizzes, 1 Final, 1 Research Paper (based on non-profit organization), Interview Assignment with licensed Social Worker. Prof gives extra credit.",0
"This is my second semester at GVSU but not my first year with college classes. Professor Blackman truly cares about her students... No Text pur. HOWEVER - She assigns approx 15 - 20 things to do a week from readings, homework, quizzes - REQUIRES students to attend a zoom meeting (half on Saturday and Half on Monday). Its like 1/3rd of your grade",0
"I would recommend students to avoid this class. Borg is an uninspiring in her lectures and is unforgiving on tests. Her online tests are near impossible to do well on, and her in class exams are very difficult to prepare for without memorizing every minute detail about everything. Study guides are unhelpful and office hours are even less so. Avoid.",0
Professor Legates is a pretty chill professor so you won't have to lose your mind worrying about getting a good grade in this class. He keeps the lectures entertaining by cracking some jokes and will be real with you about the issues in class. Doesn't assign that much work and the tests are pretty easy.,1
Big exams consisting of lots of terms. Four chapters each exam. READ THE TEXT,0
Anytime you write a paper go and discuss with him first. He will help you talk through your ideas as well as provide sources and specific reading to help you.. I got an A on every paper because of his help - he is extremely nice & approachable. Best professor I've ever had! Cannot thank him enough for the knowledge I've gained!,1
Doc Morgan was hands down my favorite professor at GV. Enough said.,1
His lectures aren't engaging whatsoever and the averages for quizzes/tests are almost always below a passing grade. He also assigns an immense amount of homework which feels like busy work half of the time. He's a super nice guy but I don't think that the way he teaches works with the online format. If you take this class you 100% need the textbook,0
Nice!!!,1
If you just want a grade yes but if you want to learn anything he is not the teacher to take.  He make you feel stupid if you have a question.  He is very unclear.  His project are very unclear.  For any questions ask your teammates not him.,0
I love this class!! You take a great deal of notes and exericise every class but it is worth it. I've lost weight and several inches of my waist already. Totally recommend this class for anyone that wants to be fit for life!!!,1
awesome prof!  refreshing change!,1
"The soc class I took was ""Social Psychology of Inequality,"" a reading heavy, but fairly laid back course. As long as you get your work and reading done, it's an easy course. The professor does a good job of going over the material that we are required to read, adding to it. The homework and tests aren't too difficult.",1
The average on this professors tests in 50%. His tests take 5 to 6 hours to take on average. He is super unhelpful and does not teach what he puts on the test.,0
"I would not take her again. I submitted multiple projects and she ""never received"" them.",0
"I would make sure to attend the lecture because there are randomly assigned projects during class. Definitely would take Kelli again she is funny, cares, and kinda understands the coursework can be dry.",1
"She doesn't believe in giving exams because not all people are test takers.  She wanted very much for people to be involved in class.  You don't have to buy a book which is nice, but you do have to do all of the reading online (which really hurts my eyes). But get ready to read for every class",1
So much homework for only 1 credit. I mean really. This class is a waste of time but unfortunately needed to go to a university. So yeah hated it.,0
"That was not a graduate course, i got a similar course content from a friend of mine at another university. I was shocked,this is ridiculous. The exam questions are unbelievable, not only they are easy, they are stupid. I regret taking this course.",0
"Stay away from her. Grossly unprofessional. Almost her entire class is failing. Her test averages are the lowest of all sections(multiple semesters). Insults students. Actually wrote up false paperwork about a student to retaliate against him filing a a complaint with dept chair. ""A"" students go become failing students in her class.",0
"Professor Kiesow was a wonderful professor. Though I did Guided Study, his constant support through the assigned essays was just what I needed. I learned a lot, and I appreciated his input.",1
I am terrible at math - took calc 3 with Prof. Luther and received a 100% in the class. I have never before understood math so clearly or have been able to perform it so well. Would definitely recommend! ,1
"The hardest class I have ever attended. While she is a nice person, her grading system is subjective. It's almost as if she expects prior knowledge of economic perspectives before taking the class. Avoid her class(es) if possible",0
"I came to every class, asked questions, read the book, followed her syllabus and rubrics, and still did terrible in the class.  She's a really nice person, but just reads from the power point during class and doesn't go into great detail with examples.  The tests were extremely difficult and she graded the papers very harshly.   ",0
"Prof Song is my favourite prof at the University of Guelph.  Always clear, helpful, and sometimes a little predictable :)",1
Excellent instructor! Very clear in his presentation and very organized in his class structure. Regarding the subject matter - thoroughly covers all the bases. You will leave learning so much. Nice guy too.,1
"This professor was extreamly vauge when explaining expectations, and was not clear at all. Her grading system is very confusing and She grades extremely harshly. When I asked for help she was rude and condescending as though she was mocking me. I would strongly recommend against taking this professor if you want to get a good grade.",0
Really respected his students. Fair quizzes and exams.,1
Best class I took at the JC.  Go on all the field trips!,1
"If you care about his class you will get a lot out of it. His teaching style worked for me personally, it might not for everyone. If programming is not naturally intuitive for you, youre going to have a hard time at first, but I think this is true regardless of the professor, he just forces you to actually learn rather than giving you the answers",1
Worst professor I had during entire UD experience. ,0
"I don't recommend you taking this class if you're not good with hard multiple choice questions also if you don't like reading because everything is from the book or his lecture notes which is not organized and clear. If you have questions, ASK him before you fail. As much as I respect him, I didn't like how he taught.",1
Dr. Nikkel is an excellent teacher. He responds quickly if you send him an email and are unsure of something. Watch his videos several times because they are helpful when doing the homework assignments. He is fair in his grading and will leave feedback. This class is a challenge but you will learn so much. Give him a try!,1
"This class is definitely a class where you have to teach yourself. His lectures are super boring, all he does is read off his powerpoint slides and there always at least 60 slides per powerpoint. Hes a super nice guy, but not a good teacher. Your main grades are 4 tests and the final is not cumulative. He also gives huge curves on tests.",1
The lecture for the day is always influenced by her mood that day.  Pray she had a good night and coffee in the morning.,0
"talks more politics than actual sociology. you will fall asleep in her class no matter what, always late, never describes assignments thoroughly, and never gives a direct answer to anything",0
"she just reads lecture notes to us in class. does not do a good job answering questions either by ignoring them or not answering them fully.
 the course with her was awful, assignments and tests were not fairly marked as the ta's did all the work.",0
"Dr. Mitterer is a very experienced, He really knows what hes talking about! He welcomes all his students, hes great with communicating with us, the lectures are so fulfilling just VERYY long! ",1
"Mrs. Lemon is such a great professor and coming to class is so exciting every day. Select Women's Ensemble has helped me develop my skill as a singer so much, and it's helped my confidence grow too. Mrs. Lemon always makes the class laugh and has quotes every day that are inspirational and make me feel proud to be a woman.",1
"Very lazy professor, have him 2 times a week. On the monday or tuesday class we spend half the time watching videos submitted by students explaining a problem from the hw which is a waste of time. The other day of his class he sends out pre recorded lectures. If I had to describe him in one word I would struggle deciding between lazy or disengaged.",0
"Ridiculously long labs, unnecessarily complicated, and each lab is only worth 2% of your final grade. Avoid at all costs",0
"Not an easy course if you do not have a basic grasp on algebra. He has a specific style of teaching that worked well for me. Just goes through how to solve the problem and that worked for me. The homework is all online and easy to do but there is a lot of it. His grading criteria is easy, fair, and he tries to give every opportunity for success.",1
Professor Lazarus is an amazing teacher. Coming into your first year of law school is intimidating at best and he really makes class interesting and understandable! Study for the quizzes because they are hard but you'll be happy you had them =),1
This boy sure knows how to drive a point home. The best dude at MMC,1
"Prof. Jalpal, knows his Marketing stuff, but he can't teach an introductory class.  Now if your at advanced marketing level than he's your man.  I can't support prof. that says, i don't get paid to provide solution to cases he uses in the class, and so won't handout his solutions.  Also, he has the class do 3 group presentations on same case/day",0
"His lectures are awesome. He gets really excited about the subjects and provides his own personal experience. He made the material really interesting and lively. His tests were easy if you do the study guide. He's upfront about tests, everything is covered in the study guide and throughout the lectures he'll tell you whatll be on the test. Love him",1
"somewhat disorganized, and kind of boring... tries to be ""fun"" but not so good at that either",0
"His lectures are clear and organized which is nice. Sometimes he can go off on random tangents though, especially if you ask a question. Then we get behind in the notes and he will either just skip it and expect you to learn it or rush through it. The homeworks are long and hard.",1
"Ostermeyer has the class set up so that you can only fail if you don't read attentively and consistently work. While there are quite a bit of readings, essays, and quizzes, though they are short. Many lectures recap readings, which will be useful. I'd recommend doing the readings first, then watch and note lectures.",1
"Tana was a really nice and engaging professor. But you can easily get drowned in the reading and the memos are graded incredibly harsh. Though, because I participated a lot during the class Tana noticed this and bumped by grade up because of it so she's an understanding teacher as well.",1
"This professor is hard. You need to read tons of readings and articles prior class otherwise you have no idea what is she talking about. Participation is extremely important, she makes marks on her attendance sheet every time you participate. Her exams are tricky and confusing. If you want to get an A, then don't take her.",0
"I very much enjoyed this class, we did group projects, she understands everyone and their fear of speaking in front. She did not only made the class funny but we learned as we laugh which made it memorable. Going to that type of class you need to pick this, you wont be dissapointed at all, I highly recommend it for anyone. She knows how to teach !",1
"Cool Professor, he's fair and helpful. Has an accent but he's still clear and easy to understand. Group projects, Lots of HW, and 2 exams (mid term and final) which are somewhat difficult. Only annoying this is his grading scale. ex. 93% is an A- rather than the standard 90% being an A-.",1
"If you want a class where you get to see sloppily written and nonsensical math all over the board, this is the class for you. However, the course revolves around the use of mathematica, which makes the class bearable.  The prof is hilarious though, so many random stories that will make you laugh and further confuse you.",0
"Easy professor for studio, doesnt give much work usually. but when he does he gives a whole lot together. Wen it comes to grading he sucks. If ur a teachers pet and suck up to him, then he's great for u.",0
"Took for Lit of American Minorities: Latino. Very knowledgeable and interesting teacher. Class is based 40% on participation with some essays around 10 pages. He is a generous grader, not a hard A if you work with him.",1
"Absolutely phenomenal teacher.  Very interesting and very funny.  His lectures cover all the material, so you don't really need a textbook (I found his explanations better than the textbook anyway).  The course was difficult, but made a lot better by the prof.",1
"Dr. Ross is an AWESOME professor. Passionate about the class, knowledgeable, and really willing to go the extra mile to help out if you've got a problem/question. If you do the readings and go to his lectures, you shouldn't have a problem getting an A.",1
"An absolutely outstanding professor. It may seem hard to know what he expects. Just pick something you are most comfortable with (I.E. even an exam), and attend class, pay attention, and THINK about the material. As long as you are interested, it is easy to do well. Unfortunately he has retired. Probably the best PSY prof you can get. Got A+.",1
"He was awful. tells unfunny jokes, isn't clear about what he's teaching. Takes forever to get to the actual coursework and likes to go off talking about whatever he feels like. Doesn't offer any extra credit.",0
Tests are extremely hard - requires you to memorize obscure facts about music that is painful to listen to. Class is filled with useless facts that the professor falsely believes to be important.,0
he doesn't know how teach paragraph and which you don't  understand clearly what he want to do this rule that he gave you  I recommend don't take this class.... ,0
Not impressed.  Makes excuses and doesn't give you proper preparation for this.  Expects you to be prepared but then isn't prepared herself!  Negligent and doesn't see to care about the class.  Take a different professor.  Wish I could drop.,0
"I took his history class for the condensed summer semester, I knew my work was cut out for me but this class was extra. I do well In just about every class, but in this particular class I struggled to obtain a 3.1 so choose wisely. Thats not to say he isnt a good professor, he is a good professor, I learned a lot in this class but theres no breaks.",0
"Jan is fabulous. She is very helpful and understanding. I would definitely recommend taking a class with her. She expects certain things out of her students but its not too much to ask. Her tests are just as she says they are, she does not put something on the test if she didnt tell you it was going to be on there. She is terrific. A+!",1
"literally ive never had a professor talk as much as she does about the most pointless stuff in the world. every single class period she just rambles about the same thing until class is over. shes super sweet and stuff but she doesnt even follow her own attendance policy described in the syllabus, her reasoning being to weed out kids. drop her.",0
The meanest professor I have ever encountered at UW. Never put her feet into students' shoes!!! Switched out of her section after she mocked at me because I got one clicker question wrong!!!,0
"Grace was really very understanding about my incomplete. I found her to be a competent and personable teacher who is really invested in the success of her students. The books weren't my style, but others in my class enjoyed them very much.",1
"Professor Nuchereno is really passionate, not only about her subject, but her students too. She clearly cares that everyone learns the material, and if you come to class she will teach it in a way that you will learn.  Although it would be really easy to skip her class because it seems easy, I STRONGLY recommend you go.  Test material  class notes",1
"Best professor I've ever had! This class focuses on health programs and effects in workplaces. There is chapters posted for reading, there is no textbook. Quizzes cover readings! Some topics covered are less interesting than others, but that's life. This class is great if interested in health promotion! I recommend her for every class possible!",1
"Absolute Horrible teacher, plays videos from 3 years ago for lecture, expects you too teach yourself. Quiz every week over content you didn't learn. Tests are very hard and doesn't give you enough time.",0
It says more about the student body at Queen's than it does about Dr. Jolly that her ratings are so low.,1
"Terrible terrible professor. Took him for CS245E (online bc Covid) in Spring 2020. He was just so lazy, was always lagging behind on assignments and checking and releasing material. Really unhelpful on Piazza and inconsiderate when students were struggling with challenging assignments and were requesting for assignment deadlines.",0
"I had her for two courses and the difficulty level was the same for both of them; almost non existent. There is so much extra credit that you can miss a few quizzes and still get an A. She lectures almost all the time with a couple speakers, but it can get boring. Seemed like she wasn't prepared for class periods and read off of online articles.",1
Unorganized and no concept of time management - lost grade book for some of the semester - I never knew how I was doing during the semester.  I spent 1 5 weeks feeling frustrated and confused and bored.,0
"can be rude when asking for help, doesnt even really help, makes the class harder then what it should be, acts like she cares but doesnt, 10/10 dont recommend Lockdown browser Quiz /hw questions every week even tho she doesnt teach in class so be prepared to learn on your own. Be prepared to spend a lot of your time on this class alone",0
"Online and in-person she lectures with no visual aid, she reads directly out of the textbook but not in order so you can't follow along, does not use bright space even for online courses and doesn't bother responding to emails. I also didn't receive either of my midterm grades until the day of the second midterm and during the exam period. Avoid!",0
Great Professor that was always open and encouraged seeing him during office hours. The homework is online with him working out the same problem with different numbers and the step by step for it. The lecture notes are posted online but he adds to them in the margin during class.,1
"Dale seems like a really great man who is super passionate about what he teaches. However, his teaching style is extremely hard to grasp and very all over the place. The textbook and assignments have absolutely nothing to do with the tests which makes it even more difficult. Nothing is on moodle so class attendance is necessary.",0
She is the best math teacher I have ever had. Her lectures are really clear and concise. She doesn't assign homework but does have a weekly quiz. She is more concerned about you understanding the material instead of getting the right answer. The tests are sometimes tricky but she gives a ton of partial credit. She is really funny and truly cares.,1
"Not good. I would understand everything and be able to do the in class problems, but then would get to the test and the problems would be nothing like what we did in class. The test material was always unexpected no matter how much I prepared for the exams.",0
"Mr. Johnson is a great teacher and perfectionist. I am a dance major and I took his tap, jazz, and ballet classes. The classes are very easy. What they need to do is make more advanced classes for the peope that have danced longer can have a challenge. Auditions need to be held.",1
"Dr. Brophy lecture's show how much he cares about the topic, but they can be long. he does expect his students to read a lot and reflect on what they read in Friday discussions. there are 3-4 write requirements.",1
Terrible professor who has no business teaching. If you ever want to talk to him about anything related to the class or your grade give up because he almost never has time to meet. He will always say hes busy and make up excuses. overall a horrible professor.,0
Terrible. Here is someone who (which he openly admits) couldn't make it in corporate america and decided to become a professor. Another profession he is terrible at. Peffer belongs at the university of phoenix teaching a subject other than accounting.,0
"Rather than spending lectures on mastering the basics of each concept, Ralston and Tyler expect you to teach yourself the basics and spend class time on advanced examples which require mastery of the basics to know. The worst thing is that every Tuesday you're required to take not 1 , but 2 tests in 90 minutes. You rarely have enough time.",0
BEST PROFESSOR EVAR!!! This guy took the math out of econ. He explains these complicated topics in terms like Pizza and Beer! Go to every class and you don't need a book or to study too much.,1
"Cares about what you learn, really wants you to pick your topics so it allows you to be interested and care about your work! Good professor and very reasonable!",1
"Very good professor, super hard class... very fair grader, though.  Good luck with the class... you'll need it.",1
"I LOVED this class! She has so much first hand counselling knowledge and for the first time I felt like I was learning about things that happen to people instead of just psych theory. Super accessible information, always tries to keep it interesting. Exams can be tough but always fair - if you go to class and read the text once, you'll do well.",1
He is really knowledgeable but really bad at teaching. Easy marker but you will get your papers back may be one month later.,0
"Easily the worst math teacher/professor I have ever had. He doesn't know what he is doing, ever, and can barely solve the homework that he assigns. Although he doesn't have a single clue about calculus, he is a really nice guy and you're basically guaranteed an A if you do the homework and the extra credit assignment at the end.",0
"Monica Hall is an amazing professor!  She is very clear when explaining different topics.  BIO 121 is a very difficult class, but she makes the material make sense.",1
"Dr Abdallah Mohamed is the best possible professor anybody could have. He is very helpful and gives a lot of feedback. He explains concepts clearly and he does everything in his power to make sure nobody faces any difficulties, especially in the online environment where technical difficulties are common place. Best prof ever. Thank you Dr Mohamed!",1
"Dr. Birckbichler obviously hates teaching this class.  He is rude and cranky all of the time.  Also, he accused us of all kinds of things.  I honestly learned nothing from him. ",0
Extremely intelligent and dark in charcter. He plays life like a Chess game. Extremely raw in nature. Observe him and be humored but awoid being sucked into the web.,0
"Worst professor I have ever taken in both my undergrad and graduate career. Lectures are unorganized and incoherent. Showed up 30 minutes late to the final. Changed the midterm rules 5 hours before the midterm. Sloppy handwriting. Never returned homeworks, or midterm. Doesn't explain concepts or equations in lecture; learned nothing from him.",0
"Professor Wejksnora is a fantastic lecturer and hilarious man. His tests are not to easy, but if you study the material you'll do fine. Overall i would definitely recommend him.",1
"His classes are not easy at all.You have to work extra hard to pass if not he will flunk you again and again regardless of how many times you have taken the class.My advise,STUDY..",1
"Frequently late to class, rarely responds to emails, tests you over things that aren't covered but doesn't use the book. She requires you to purchase the book even though it's on canvas... We're very behind and continuously get farther behind because she goes off on tangents about her kid or husband. DO NOT take",0
Dr. Pharr is a great professor!,1
"Hall is insane; there's no way to sugarcoat it. His lectures usually start out on the topic of the day but quickly spiral into unfounded conspiracy theories, unrelated personal stories, and his insistence that heroine is completely safe. Somewhere in there will be a test question or two, but they're hard to discern from his ramblings. Do not take.",0
Online class in which the professor was not required to grade anything. Would not answer questions or offer ay help whatsoever.,0
"The guy is funny ill give you that,but he already expects you to be almost perfect in GRAMMER.He calls his class ""grammar land"" fun right? His teaching method is horrible..The final was on a regret we have, I should have wrote about the regret i have for not dropping his class. Dont buy the fiction book only the Rules for writers(helpful)",0
"Great teacher and person! But only gives out a few papers per semester and those are your only grades so make sure to do well on those. She can sometimes be unclear with some things, but will gladly explain them to you if you ask her for help individually. :)",1
"This class is one where subjective grading is prevalent. A majority of the class is made up of discussions and participation grades, where no real grading rubric is available. Many times the professor would talk about topics very one sided that made some people openly feel uncomfortable. The class was not the best experience for me.",0
"Great guy who truly cares about his students. You definitely need to pay attention, but if you are confused he will always be ready to help you. 10/10 recommend",1
screw this class!!! worst class i have ever taken at ucr. ridiculous group paper and 4 HARD HARD HARD tests! she is rude and thinks she is better than everybody else,0
"probably the worst teacher i have ever had.  throughout the whole semester, he only actually taught one day.  the rest of the time he just read off the powerpoint.",0
"Dr. Schneider is a great professor to have for accounting. I'm not an accounting major but I took this class for my minor. He explains the problems pretty thoroughly and is always helpful. If you can take this class with him, you won't regret it! Attendance isn't mandatory but it is part of your grade (10%) and there are 4 tests and one final.",1
Stay away unless you want to teach a class.  The prof had two students present a new tale from  The Canterbury Tales  each day.  Apparently she believed that writing a paper on a subject makes one an expert.,0
"Dr. Ryan is very knowledgeable and a good resource for all students in the health sciences. He is a fast talker, so you may need to record his lectures, and you absolutely have to study for his tests. They cover a lot of information. He does give some ""freebies"" on his tests and quizzes. He is a lot of fun and tries to make lectures interesting.",1
Really nice guy. Good class. Good content. I'd take it again.,1
"This class is graded based on weekly quizzes, three tests, a book-report style essay, and a final exam. Quizzes and tests can be very difficult as they cover a lot of material. Expect a lot of reading. Dr. Plantinga is an engaging lecturer and very intelligent, but unless you put a lot of time into studying outside of class, do not expect an A.",1
Really willing to help students with their questions though his replies usually does not answer the questions,1
final was unreasonably hard,0
"She doesn't teach most of the material in class. You have to read and memorize her own notes that haven't been updated in 15 years. Shows lots of movies in class that aren't that helpful. Would NOT take another class with her. If you can avoid taking it with her, do so.",0
Extremely disorganized class. The content is difficult and she makes it more so. The TAs open lab hours are the only way I can try to understand the content or the assignments. Lectures are taken from previous quarters so dont make any sense. Very hostile whenever I tried to clarify things with her. Essays and quizzes every week.,0
"Professor Rocek really is a nice guy and a great professor. HOWEVER, his class requires that you go to EVERY single class and read EVERY single page in the book. There is ALOT of information including full primate history and world maps. Don't take just for Group D. You should love anthropology if you're taking this class. Not easy A at all!",1
"He is old school but he is brilliant, and I learned so much in my Modern Russian State and Empire course with him.",1
ugh!!,0
The course description for this course makes it seem a lot more interesting than it really is. She is a decent professor but hard to follow in class. Read the textbook to clarify topics.,0
"heard this was an easier course but it ended up being the worst grade ive got so far in uni, he lectured & you had to write down what he said but he spoke so fast so its hard to get everything down. With the textbook readings and the novel, and with the course content itself was not easy. i had to do my midterm while packing to go home for covid-19",0
"I have a 4.0, having taken over 20 classes at Oakton. I love school. She was my worst professor. She went on vacation in the middle of the semester! She failed to answer any of my questions by email about anything, AND she gave me a B when my grades added up to an A and had to change it cause she clearly does not care at all about her students. NO!",0
The only useful lectures in this class are the exam reviews done by the assistant professors. The normal lectures are mostly useless with the occasionally odd remark by Bennett. Tests are difficult but you are allowed to exempt one from the final grade. Would look elsewhere for ECON103.,0
This professor is very nice and professional. He goes over many homework problems which is great but sometimes skips some of the work or doesn't explain what he did so students ask many questions and sometimes leaving us confused. The material is hard as it is already but he does offer help outside of class. He also curves the grade that helps alot,0
"She is very strict with attendance, hates people arriving late and if you skip class you will probably fail. There are a lot of discussions posts in her class. She is not nice with her students and her class can get boring, the only thing I liked about her class was hearing everyone's speeches.",0
"what started off as class with what we thoughyt was going to be a strong start , ended up with a dissater witha atttitude, who dissappeared 75% of the time. He had excuses in not giving back work in timely manners, the rarely showed up and used his daughter and other school additives as his dissapearance and he lacked commuinication pathetic teach",0
"Ms. Oldfather is very thorough and knowledgeable when it comes to lectures. Abit monotone a times and if you don't have the patience it can drag on, and there's barely any homework if at all. Anything that falls on her tests is covered in her lectures and if u take good notes you don't even need the book, I didn't use it and still got an A.",1
"Worst teacher I have ever had!!! Have cried after his class several times because of the rude and belitting things he would say to me. I have scoliosis and made rude comments about it. Even have the nerve to tell me that I should either ""fix my back aligment or drop the class""...",0
She is very hard to understand most of the time. I peronally wish I had just taken the class online. Going to class was pointless but was required to get participation points. It's easy material for the most part but the tests on SimNet are really hard. I would reccomend you take this class online or with another professor.,0
She is amazing. Read the book and pay attention in class and you will get an A. I learnt tons in her class!,1
"very clear, humorous",1
"I came to know Dr. Sundahl through two on-line courses;  the first lecture was  on the Book of Job.  The second on Mark Twain and Huckleberry Finn.  Of the professors lecturing, he was the best. I'm grateful for what I learned and have revisited the lectures.  There was no grade for credit but I passed the quiz.  He's a truly inspirational man.",1
Not easy. but one of my favorite profs ever,1
"Very wordy, obsessed with own field work. Lectures off-track the courses supposed topics, test questions are very abstract. NOT MEANT TO TEACH. I would highly suggest staying away from his lectures or classes.",0
"I had Dr. Sundahl over 10 years ago, and now I am an (economics) professor myself.  He was one of the most influential professors I had at Hillsdale.  If you think he's hard, suck it up.  If you can't understand him, ask or do some independent thinking.  Listen to what he says.  Trust me, it'll be useful later on, no matter what field you pursue.",1
"Has very clear expectations from you, and homework is relatively easy. All you really have to do is read diligently. The only gripe I had was that some test questions were a bit off the wall, but overall it was manageable.",1
"Dr. Suvak is a horrible professor, this man doesn't care about the well being of his students at all. A peice of advise for students taking this course, expect absolutely zero guidance and zero effort on Dr. Suvak's be half to teach you. This man's heart is black towards students. Good luck students and don't give up no matter what Dr. Suvak says.",0
Dr. Hubbard is a very dedicated professor.  She is available and accessible to her students.  Her classes require work (lots of reading and make sure you take good notes).  My only complaint is the grading criteria for her exams.  She gives a point values to certain parts of the question(s) that seems a bit arbitrary.,1
He does not care about his student AT ALL. The average for the term test was 40% and he REFUSED to give any partial marks although I got most of them right according to the test solution.,0
"Please take this with a grain of salt. I had the pleasure of having professor Adrian Garcia as my film 3 professor. All though hes nice and very easy going, I wouldnt take any of classes again. Hes unorganized, seems to make things up along the way. Doesnt speak thoroughly (ex: he informed my class that we had to present a film idea to...)",0
"Dr. Verville is awesome. I would recommend printing out the lectures because it's a lot of info that she goes over during class. Her tests are easy, if you're good at memorizing. The questions are memorization, little application, but make sure you know everything she went over in class. If you have her for lab be warned: a lot of outside work!",1
"Don't expect any of your papers graded and have feedback provided; It takes her about 2 weeks to grade things and by that time you'll of already had another 3 essays due. Its absolutely frustrating, on a regular assignment you'll be waiting to get you're grades back for about 5 other things. Avoid if possible.",0
Great professor! Very clear grading criteria and tests/quizzes were right from the notes and textbook. Interesting material and class! Highly recommend.,1
"This is a horrible teacher. She is very unclear about assignments, and hardly replies to emails. I emailed her asking for more clarity on our essay, she never replied. If she doesn't like your writing, she will let you know in the margins. She believes white men are terrible, very melodramatic, seems to be very religious, also against certain races",0
"If you skip assignments in this class or skip class in general, you are going to be in serious trouble.  If you are looking for a comprehensive U.S. History course, look somewhere else.  This class was very ""social issue"" driven and lots of important aspects and events in U.S. history were simply not covered.",0
Shame.,0
"This guy is outstanding! He really cares about his students, he's very helpful, and he makes the class fun and easy. I highly recommend him to everyone.",1
"She is hard, but you learn a lot.  If you want to learn, take Prater.  If you want an easier class, don't take her.",1
He was rude from the beginning and he was rude till the end. He gave me zeros for assignments that I did. The article review makes no sense because I turned the same paper in for a different class and got 100% in the other class and he gave me a 0/100??? dropped my grade 10 points. I email him and ask him to check everything now before I turn it in,0
Ben is a really nice and smart guy but I do not recommend his class. He's very confusing. He tries to help but usually just confuses you more. He does use the online part of the Algebra 1 and 2 textbook which has great examples if you follow along. They have examples and online personnel to help with questions. It's the only reason I did so well.,0
"Delgado is my least favorite psychology professor. 1. She is a TOUGH grader. Her quizzes are so specific and will hurt your grade if you don't study extensively. 2. While attendance is not MANTATORY, she will not respect you if you miss class. 3. She doesn't take excuses, even if you get a note from the clinic she will be petty about taking it.",0
"I spent so much time on this class, I barely had time for my 4 other classes. Obscene amounts of work, expects you to know everything, grades very harshly, and never responds to emails. She teaches nothing in the lectures, so you have to teach yourself. Good luck, she's the only professor that teaches this class.",0
Professor Desjardins was a good professor. His only setback was that he taught exclusively from his notes which were not too organized and not entirely clear (ironic since he devotes a mark on test questions for clarity). Test and exam questions did not resemble previous years' and were harder but this was likely done to counter cheating online.,1
Very disrespectful!  She told everyone to drop her class the first day.  She told students they should have nothing else going on in their lives because her class takes priority.  Then she told everyone to drop her class...again.,0
"Overall Dr. Hookey wasn't that bad. He is very test heavy with only 3 midterms (20% each) and a final (40%) and if you miss an examination he just adds equal amount on to what you have written. The course starts off very easy and gradually builds, however the last two weeks were damn near impossible to understand. DO THE PROBLEM SETS.",1
No help at all. Labs are a joke and boring as hell. Everything is so unorganized and confusing. I dreaded every single lab day. ,0
"Takes attendance, won't admit you to the exam if you have missed more than 4 lectures/dgd's. Lectures will literally make you fall asleep, however, he's a nice enough guy who does his best to be funny and keep his students entertained. Quizzes are very difficult and deduct marks on essays etc. for the silliest things.",1
"Definitely knows what she is talking about and is interested in the topics! Read book before quizzes and exams and take more thorough notes than what's on the overhead. Write down examples because the ones she gives in class are almost identical to the ones on the exams. Nice prof, not easy but fair and reasonable. Enjoyed Ariel and the class.",1
It was a really well taught class.,1
Worthless teacher.,0
"Tyrel Moore is a nice and funny man who clearly has a deep understanding and care for this subject matter, but that's about all he has to offer. Tyrel Moore is the grim reaper of your gpa. I strongly recommend taking this course if you want to fail every exam, never know what is going on, and if you enjoy being told to study the wrong materials.",0
Tough Grader.,0
Sweetha was an exceptional instructor who changed my life. She acted as a role model in the lab who exuded intelligence and integrity. Sweetha has instilled in me essential moral principles which have shaped my character as both a student and a human being. I would highly recommend Sweetha to any student hoping to make the most of their education.,1
"He gives out 6 Assignments for the class and don't think to yourself only 6 assignments wow that's easy. NOPE, the longest 6 Assignments you will ever have and I guarantee it. And each assignment has at least 2 parts to it. Please do not take this professor if you do not absolutely have to. I promise you that you will regret taking his class.",0
Best teach Ive ever had! Made me want to be a tax accountant,1
Her class is the best in my opinion she makes all the classes interesting and she cracks a few jokes here and there. Makes sure you attend all the classes or else you miss the concept for the next class meeting.,1
"A really good teacher. Lectures can get tedious, but class still interesting",1
Tom taught more in PAX than I had ever learned in another class. If you're looking for a good learning experience take this class! If you're not willing to work for the grade it will show.,1
"Tests are unfairly restricted by time rather than precision, and one small mistake will cost you up to 20% Tip: once you feel comfortable with the practice tests, practice every possible problem from the book and from online sources. Practice tests do not resemble the actual test by any means. Also ask as many questions as possible.",0
"not good teacher, boring, hard to pass,  bad dresser",0
"I took this class already having  experience with the subject matter, but Remlinger definitely has very high expectations and I can see why people talk about how difficult she is. However, I really cannot see all the accusations of not caring about students or being willing to help. She was always very warm and more than open to provide assistance.",1
"Not much teaching, content is typed up more clearly than lectures, class is mostly autograded",0
"Hanley is a great professor, he's v passionate about phil & he definitely knows what he's talking about. def isnt an easy class. Show up as much as possible bc the lectures are the biggest help (IF U PAY ATTENTION). The 1st exam i got a 43% , the 2nd i got a 92% , so it takes a little to get the hang of, & he gives u study guide before every test!!",1
She is a really harsh grader. My essays are always my lowest grades.,0
"Keep your own views out of science. or better yet, take the science out of social science, and call it social studies. The prof took it upon her to ensure, only what she wanted taught to the class was taught, many contradicting studies were ignored, and Socialism and Feminism is a VIEW not SCIENCE and thus should be kept out of University courses.",0
"Professor Lange has honestly made my experience at Grand Valley so amazing! I love him as a professor, and he understood how busy I was throughout the year when I missed at like 5 assignments that he would open back up for me. Lecture isn't necessary since there is a powerpoint/book, but he makes a lot of connections to the assignments there. HW!!!",1
"Wouldn't recommend to anyone. Extremely boring. The tests are completely hard and the questions don't have anything to do with what we learned in class. If you have to take this class, just bring a book or other homework to work on in the back.",0
"Professor Roy is very hard to understand. Make sure you go to office hours and clarify things you don't get at first. Don't skip class, because once you fall behind, it's almost impossible to recover.",0
"Woody is one of the coolest teachers at Saint Leo! He gives you the option of how you want your grades to be set up. If you at least try, the class shouldn't be hard at all. Not many group projects, but definitely a lot of in class group work. I'm not sure how any couldn't like him he's one of those teachers you always speak to outside of class.",1
I get better marks in graduate year classes and do half the work,0
"While actual doctors teach real science about relevant anatomy and issues that are destroying human lives around the world, this guy is busy walking fields counting plants. Pathetic legacy.",0
This woman is not what she seems. Mean:(,0
"So half the time she doesn't ever know what she's teaching us. We ask her a question and she says ""Uhm, let me think about that for a second... nope I don't really have an answer for you. Sorry."" How professional. We also wasted a lot of time in class talking about stuff in her slides that she ended up saying is not important to the test. AVOID HER",0
"Extremely good teacher, very passionate, open and helpful. Definitely recommend!",1
"Although he only teaches BA101 he really cares for his students. Very personable, lectures are interesting, stories are funny, and just an all around great guy. Take his class, you won't regret it.",1
"Awesome prof, brings a lot of his own experience into the material. Has a good sense of humor, laughs at his own jokes a lot which is funny. Grading system is different but works, keep up with reading and you're set. Tests weren't hard as long as you took something from the class.",1
"Great teacher, once you approach him respectfully and remain aware of deadlines, which are not extremely clear. I didn't touch the text book until it was time to write the take-home final and I managed an A in the class. He prefers to let you learn for yourself which is frustrating but like I said, easy A.",1
"If you need to take Biology 2401, take her! She is funny and crazy (in a good way). She is hands on and helps you in any kind of way!",1
"Great teacher, would recommend taking her classes. Kinda easy, but still some work. Be sure to talk to her after class and get to know her.",1
O'leary will communicate clearly what material you are responsible for learning and is passionate about the subjects he teaches,1
"This was one of the worst history classes I've ever had to take, this class made me lose any interest in history that I had. Even with recording her lectures you didn't get the necessary information for her quizzes or exams and asking her to slow down did nothing for how fast and sporadic her lectures were. I would avoid her at all costs",0
He wasn't in class teaching most of the time!  esion wtf?,0
"Just give him a chance, it takes a while to get used to his teaching style. I will say there is a lot of reading for this class, but it is usually painless. 2 papers a semester; easy grader. Go to class; he really does want you to do well.",1
"Very concise lectures, they make great study notes. However I did not enjoy him, he can be very arrogant.  Favours some over others, I would never want to take a class with him again.",0
"Pete is seriously my favorite teacher I've ever had. He is so encouraging, not just in your art skills but in life also. He is so inspirational. Although he talks a lot, I always like what he has to say. I wish I could take all my classes with him. Such a down to earth man.",1
Study guide equals test. Funny guy but the class does get boring somedays. Must attend class to pass,1
Don't expect to do good if this is not your major. You definetly need a piano the exams are extremely hard and the assignments are too advanced for mus 101.  All homework is not explained in class and you have to research in class. Most homeworks are very irrelevant to the coarse and what she teaches. ,0
"Get to know him, and you guys will be solid for the entire semester. Let him know if you are struggling or need any help, and he will do everything he can to accommodate you. Super chill.",1
"Very good teacher. He goes through everything in class and is always willing to help. He may come off as picky and mean at first, but he is an extremely funny and smart teacher.",1
she was a great teacher! if you needed help she was there. she is also very understanding. we had a book to read but it wasnt bad. it was just to give you tips on writing which helped your essays anyway. participation and attendance is a must but if you miss one class its no big deal. she also cancelled class a few times which was kinda nice.,1
"This is the worse professor I've had, extremely rude. I emailed him to clarify information, his first response was to read the description. I sent him another email because I was still confused. He responded extremely rude and angrily, making me feel like my only choice was to drop the class. Take a different class if you like to ask questions.",0
"Stay away from Deilly. She cannot adequately explain course concepts by herself, electing to basically read the text book verbatim during class. She has next to no knowledge of the subject matter, and makes a point of being unwelcoming to students. Her class is intolerably boring and she has a serious attitude problem.",0
I enjoyed this class. He mostly left it up to us what we talked about in class. He also showed he cared about us and insrtuctions were clear.,1
"I got a C+ (3.6 gpa student) in her class, but barely, and from the help of others not her. She is literally the most unhelpful teacher I have ever had. The TA may have been worse, not sure though. No feedback is given, so you have to wait until after the final is taken to understand if you've been doing things correctly. FIU needs to look into her",0
Crazy amount of work for an elective.,0
"This professor is way too difficult. She is extremely confusing and drops a load of work on you from the start. The class just started for me and I instantly regret this taking her. I don't know how I'm going to pass this. If you're looking for a chill and normal PSYC class, this is not it. This is for the people that like to work very very hard.",0
"hard to follow because he tells so many irrelevant stories (over and over again). i learned a lot, but sometimes his class was boring and hard to sit through.",0
Great man. Greater outfits,1
"one of the least coordinated, most confusing professors I've ever had. Do. Not. Take.",0
"Falcon has a huge fan club, but he's simply not a good teacher. If you sign up for his class, read the syllabus and you will see what I mean. Frustratingly obtuse man with no problem being ""tough"" (but not really tough, just irrespobsible)",0
"Mr. bunn was a nice guy, but he isn't one to baby you, you must study the material when doing the homework. it is impossible t pass the class without the book.",0
"Dr. VanRandWyk is extremely knowledgeable about music theory, and an absolute pleasure to know and learn from.",1
"He is really boring, but if you can get ""study guides"" then you are totally fine to get at least a B Not as horrible as people make him out to be. You really dont have to go to class much, but if you do Drink COFFEE!",0
"P.R-J is an amazing prof. He's smart,helpful,no nonsense. His grading system is rigorous but fair. If you are serious, dedicated & actually work instead of being intellectually & physically lazy then you will get a lot out of it. If you are looking for an easy A this is not your playground.",1
Biggest issue: Lectures. 1. Slides do not contain enough info. 2. Notes have to be taken as he dictates so spelling is often off when learning about Eastern religions. 3. Lectures did not end at the expected time & often ran for an extra 1/2 hour! 4. Lectures are pointless as he dictates too fast & better notes are taken at home with the textbook.,1
"Quite honestly the worst professor Ive had in a while. She was almost completely absent from the course the entire semester. Never answered emails in a timely manner, doesnt respond to student questions online, never made assignments available in time for when we were to do them. Complete lack of attention from professor. Do not recommend.",0
"Course notes were very unclear and filled with errors. Didn't need to attend class b/c we just went over course notes. Unlike prof said, exam was out in left field somewhere, not anything like the tests or assignments. Could have been a half decent course if it was better organized. He is willing to help if he sees your face in class regularly.",0
funniest professor i've ever had! definitely makes class interesting & worth going to.,1
This class is the most boring thing I have ever experienced. There is a weekly homework assignment and 3 essays. If try to get an A and are unsuccessful you are not meant for college. You are allowed resubmission's on your essays and are able to skip some of the weekly assignments. The only difficulty is making yourself go to class.,1
I took csc 101 with him and he grades really hard. Tests are very hard and hard to study for. Lectures do not teach all the things you need for that days homework either.,0
"Her test are "" Super Hard"" Hopefully I pass her class she rates on a curve but idk  right now my grade isnt looking good  I tryed so hard but her test are ""hard"" (the wording)",1
If you are in anyway religious do not take his class. He is very opinionated even when he doesn't try to be. He assigns papers at the end of the semester and he grades them hard. He also grades homework extremely hard.,0
i was scared to approach her in the class ... the course work was very heavy shes a nice professor but that class was not for me,0
"Joe Kirtland has a vast understanding of calculus. He is very good at helping out on problems during office hours. However, he does give a lot of homework that take a while to do. Overall, very nice respectable professor that is enthusiastic in class.",1
Great teacher. She really takes the time to get you to understand the information and gives good feedback. She puts her PowerPoints that she teaches from on Blackboard and all you really need for the class is the online homework course.,1
"Dr. Logo, where do we begin?  This guy is amazing!  He's so much fun, and so enthusiastic, you can't help but enjoy his class!  He does love broccoli and pepper sandwiches.  He is such a sweet guy- he'll do anything for you if you simply ask.  He is the EXACT type of professor CMU needs.",1
"It's all been said already. He is very knowledgible, but doesn't know how to teach it to students.",0
"Really caring professor, lectures can be dull but if you take notes you'll definitely be fine for the exams. Textbook is very easy to read and great for reviewing for exams. There is a decent amount of homework, but they are spaced out every 2 weeks so if you start early you'll be fine.",1
"I honestly do not even know where to start. - Her teaching is all over the place. - She is very confused when she is teaching and therefore her exams are also confusing - Does not like when people go to the bathroom or are 1 minute late to class, even though she is late most of the time - I am an A student but got a very low grade with her.",0
"Prof Olney is really nice and a funny prof. He is very knowledgeable about the information. The class was fairly easy. Just copy down every thing son the powerpoints for the test. The book was not absolutely necessary, there are 1 or 2 questions per test from it.. I found the book online for free at library genesis . com.",1
He does not give a clear description of the assignments but still penalizes youre grade if you arent writing exactly how he likes. Even after emailing to ask for clearer guidelines he did not provide any.,0
"She is a tough grader, I wouldn't recommend her class if you aren't confident in your writing or aren't confident in research papers. She didn't really work with us on a research paper and how to form one as a first year student. I had to try to get as much help as I can outside of class and I was confused on how she wanted the paper to be.",0
Terrible at explaining things and not very helpful but luckily the class was just 206 repeated.  Wouldn't recommend for classes that are actually hard.,0
"Really boring. The class is not that difficult, but she has like a million slides and makes you stay almost the entire time. Her accent is a little thick, and she's not that friendly. Overall, she's okay. We didn't use the textbook a lot, and she made us write both a paper and have a presentation.",0
"Even though it was very intensive because over the summer(only 11 classes),i got a good understanding of the material.However,we had quizes on every chapter plus 2exams and final.At least he was speaking loudly and slowly so it was easy to understand him.We solved a lot of problems from the book in class that helped a lot!I recommend this teacher!",1
Relatively interesting lectures.  Organized.  Nice guy.  I liked him.,1
Everything you need to know is on the power points. Listen to her stories as well,1
I am acutally disappointed to see that this prof. has not received a good review.  I beleive she is very fair but will not tolerate nonsense.  She won't hold your hand but everyone's got to grow up sometime.,1
"Expects too much and pushes students too hard. Teaching style is weird for me personally, did not like it at all. No makeups. Overall frustrating class due to teacher.",0
"John is honestly the best! I was worried about taking stats as a psyc major because math isn't my best subject, but he made it very simple and easy to understand. If you have the opportunity to take stats with him do it!! Easy A!!",1
"Started a lecture on how he does not care if you pass his class. Says he has a class Avg. of a D. Homework is ridiculous and takes 1.5-2 hours to complete just a piece of it, as it is an interactive quiz like set up. Condescending and rude when I asked for help or clarification.",0
"He was very nice but a very difficult class. I took this class first semester of freshman year not really knowing what to expect/not knowing much about economics. I struggled a lot and did not understand the material at all, and his lectures didn't really help me personally. He calls on you randomly too, be aware of that.",0
"Willing to help his student in any way possible . Sometimes you do feel kinda lost in the class but if you review the material in your time you will be fine! Great thing about him is he doesn't use the textbook at all . His midterm and final are very fair, just like his practice exams. I would highly recommend him ! Very nice Prof !",1
"Great personality and sense of humor. You can tell he takes pride in what he does. Only take his class if you like content to be taught like a story. Powerpoints are on blackboard. I recommend writing down what he says, that's if you can. Talks off topic. I felt like he was there to teach and leave. Slow grader. Also not informative whatsoever.",0
all you do is read the textbook. the lecture are SOOO short and no help at all. I was really disappointed by this class.,0
"Paul is vague, unclear, unhelpful, and ultimately a waste of time. Even if you work many hours on a project that's clearly amazing, he'll probably criticize it for some obscure reason. Very biased against certain types of art and will make class miserable and for those who don't agree with him.",0
"He is a good professor! He is really funny and often makes jokes during class. I especially like how he gives you a note packet, instead of saying look at the book.",1
Only concentrated on early Xn era.  Nothing past that.  Bible beaters only.  Opposing viewpoints will be downgraded.,0
Dr. FIscher only grades you on 3 tests in this class. There are options for extra credit but most are projects that you are made aware of less than a week before the due date. Had a test on Election Day in 2020? Gets upset with students that can't make it to physical class due to the PANDEMIC? Not accommodating. Avoid if you can.,0
Honestly this was an easy class to get by in without doing much although my grade only came out with about a C.  Only work done in class is a 300 word journal summary of the week's lecture and a midterm and final done online but he gives you the questions done ahead of time. He is kind of a tough grader and this class is so boring!!!,1
"Dr. Bottomley is very passionate about being an Engineer.  She is so influential and she has really inspired me, as a girl, to engage in the profession and go against the female stereotypes.  I really enjoyed learning from her.  As for the class itself, you have a semester project to work on outside of class and you learn about cool stuff in class.",1
This professor is really great at what she does but is really not great at helping the students. The work load is very high and she is a really tough grader. In a class that is pretty self explanatory i didn't really learn anything. Needs to cut back the work load and teach better through example.,0
Go class pay attention and ask questions. He is very helpful all you have to do is ask.  His test are very hard but study and ask questions and you will be fine.,1
"The hardest marker I've ever encountered! The course was interesting and rather easy. I would get nearly every true/false, multiple choice and fill in correct on the tests, but he was very unclear of what he wanted in the long answer questions.Definitely suggest avoiding him, he was also rude to anyone who wasn't in love with the course (like me!).",0
"THIS PROFESSOR IS HORRIBLE. I STRUGGLE WITH ESSAYS AND  AS I TOOK HIS ENGLISH 21 CLASS, I FELT LIKE I DID NOT LEARN NOT ONE THING. YES, I PASSED HIS CLASS BUT IT WAS A STRUGGLE. I HAD TO DO MY OWN RESEARCH ON HOW TO DO A PAPER. EVERYTIME I ASKED HIM FOR HELP HE WOULD COME UP WITH SOMETHING TOTALLY OUT OF THE SUBJECT.",0
"He is HORRIBLE! Do not take this class! He has a syllabus, but no due dates, and he expects you to submit things on time. Then he does not remind you if something is due.",0
"she's an okay professor. She's not the best, but she's very nice.",0
"Nehring is passionate about his work but his lectures are dense and frustrating. He goes off on tangents that have little nothing to do with the material and rather than develop on texts, reads a couple memorable quotes and calls it a day. I'm not sure what rock music has to do with Modernism and literature, but he sure talks about it a lot.",0
"I love Dr. Isley with all of my heart! She is the best professor that I had this far and I would love to take her with me as I finish my journalism journey! She made class interesting, she always included us in her plans and provided many hands on experiences for us to learn deeper. If you are taking journalism, sign up for her classes!",1
"The first time i met Dr. Galbus, i was like ""here we go."" She is a tough professor, but you can easily get an A by reading, coming to class, and doing the homework. I was one of 3 people in a class of 20 to get an A, and those were my keys to success. ASK for help if needed. She is very intelligent and WILL help you. Do your part, and an A is easy",1
Professor Konya graded way too harshly and doesn't seem to care if a huge percentage of his class is failing or has to withdraw to not get an F. He takes off so many points for tiny things. I definitely advise against ever taking his classes!,0
"Very helpful and always accessible. Always gives good and positive feedback.  If you have a passion for Math, you will definitely enjoy every single class with him",1
"A nice lady with very rigid grading criteria. I would say she is an ok teacher, but CALC2 is just a terrible class overall to take.",1
I had Anton for 141 lab and recitation and it wasn't worth showing up for. The only reason to go is to get your quiz grades for recitation and to do the labs that take less than 10 minutes. Anton has a thick accent but you can still understand him. Don't try and get him to explain anything because he will just confuse you more. He is a nice guy.,0
She is the worst professor that I have ever had. I was very interested in anthropology until I took her class. I would  suggest taking ATH with a different Professor.,0
"Intermediate is tough, and Gabbin does not help make it any easier. Moving online was the worst thing that could have happened for this class. He barely taught any material and basically left students stranded for the remainder of the semester. Hard to believe he cares about his students.",0
"I learned so much in this class, be prepared to spend a good 2 hours per day on this class if you want a good grade. I worked full time while taking this class and it was a nightmare. READ THE CHAPTER BEFORE YOU COME TO LECTURE, it won't seem like she's going as fast and her ideas will be much clearer.",1
Best Prof teaches the hardest ones,1
"Don't take her, horrible teacher. Dropped from the class cause I wasn't understanding anything. Took it the next semester with another teacher and understood everything and did well in the class. Doesn't know how to separate teaching and personal feelings. If she doesn't like you good luck, she'll make it obvious she doesn't like you. Just Horrible",0
"Glaser is a great lecturer and clearly cares about students. The lectures are sometimes dry and there is a lot of reading. Readings are very important for the exams and the IDs can be tricky, which makes it harder to do well in the class.",1
She is super funny and super helpful!,1
In class on week 7 he just started grading things. There was even a group email of all the students in his class talking about how he wasn't doing his job. He rarely gave feedback and doesn't have a rubric so as he grades so he starts marking down points and can go from a fully working code & half credit due to little things considered 'bad prog.',0
"If you have to take this professor (speaking for the MBA classes only, not sure about undergrad) just know the final exam means everything. Had an A in the class that didn't end up mattering. Exam was difficult and not much like the homework. Get ready to study study study and good luck. Seems like a nice professor but didn't hear from him much",0
"She is not a good teacher.  A lot of people also in my internet class feel the same way.  There are some questions on the assessments, quizzes and exams that are not in the book at all.  When I contact her, the replies seem like she is typing out of a script.  I feel like she does not understand issues that I am having in her class.",0
"He is one of my worst teachers as a freshman at UD. During his recorded lessons, he repeats himself and rambles on without ever defining any terms or giving concrete information. He uses things like ""who get what, when, where.."" etc to describe terms you never heard of before. One of the most boring teachers ever. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASSES.",0
Easy class for the most part. There are a lot of group projects. Somehow there are no presentations which doesnt make any sense because this a speech class. Teacher is a bit awkward but he is nice.,0
"She was not a friendly person and giving everyone that feeling that she was seeing teaching as an errand for herself. Otherwise, she may know her stuff but knowing and teaching a class are completely different things.",0
"I have had Prof. Smith for two different classes, and I feel the same way about both of them.  He did a fantastic job with assignments and grading, and gave useful feedback about my assignments throughout the semester.  He was well organized, and I will continue to take any class I can that Prof. Smith offers.",1
"Honestly, for a Gen Ed he was insane. I didn't get much out of the class at all, what I studied for wasn't even on his exams. The entire class is just four exams. You better be a good test taker in order to pass. He is very off topic, isn't super helpful, and if you don't have his books he asks you to read, good luck.",0
"A fantastic professor - very entertaining and very good lecturer. Makes sure you have a chance to hear his explanation once and then restates things for your notes. Not an ""easy A"" class, but frankly you shouldn't be at UVA if that's what you want. Just come to lecture and read the book assignments and the tests are a breeze. Take this class!",1
"This fake smart professor is the very worst professor I've ever had, and no one loves English more than I do.  Not only is this man ill-informed and confused, but he treats his students with arrogance and distain.  Beware, this man is secretly incredibly stupid.  I think my IQ dropped since I took his class.  Can PhDs be revoked?!",0
Tests are fairly easy as they are composed of study guide questions word for word. Attendance isn't mandatory but he gives info that's not in the textbook that can show up on the final so its best to go to class. He's an older guy that goes out of his way to make your life easier. Would recommend.,1
"Dr. Jebb was a very quirky, strange professor who was disrespectful towards students and rather unhelpful in lecture, office hours, and comments on assignments.  His syllabus is difficult to follow and some of his expected procedures for assignments are not stated in the syllabus.  He is a tough grader and does not state his grading criteria.",0
"Giving her an average because I expect a college course to be challenging. She probably made it more difficult than it should have been. If you dont repeat everything word from word from her lectures on the exam, you get marked down. I was able to pass this class because she ended up leaving at the end of the semester.",1
Mr. Baumgartner is very helpful!,1
"WOW, you will regret wasting money on her class. Not only is she boring she does absolutley nothing, she doesn't teach, she picks her favs and labels the students she dislikes and harasses them. She is biased, ugly and spaced out!",0
So easy and cool and fun. I never participated but I still got an A. She requires a few papers and a simple presentation as the final.,1
shouldn't be teaching intro,0
"I thoroughly enjoyed Dr. White's class. I was very excited to take a class on South Asia and Dr. White was very passionate about his field of study and he brought that passion into his class. I feel like I learned a lot in his class. The class is not hard if you show up and pay attention. He has study sessions before tests, go to them they help!",1
"You must hand write all your notes and they must be turned in by the end of the semester or you get an F. You miss a project deadline by a few hours you get an F, in my case my father died. You might as well pray to get a D if you take her course. AVOID!",0
Very hard to figure out exactly what he is wanting from projects.  He also DOES NOT know his stuff.  The winning project from last semester contained incorrect definitions and quotes taken out of context.  It is difficult to trust what you learn from professors like this.,0
"DO NOT TAKE HER!!!! Her class is only worth 500 points with about 6 assignments, so if you don't do good on an assignment you have no chance of getting a good grade. This class should be an easy A class but she does not explain any assignment, and she is a hard grader. She also takes forever to grade so you never know what you have in the class.",0
"Avoid this man at all costs! The exams are 8-10 multiple choice questions with at least 8 choices per question, so there is absolutely no partial credit, even if you do the entire problem correctly and just make a miscalculation.  His lectures are boring, his explanations are complicated, and he doesn't seem to care very much about his students.",0
"Interacted more with the TA for the class, but Dr. Corder's lectures were good and easy to follow along with.  If you read the book and go to discussion, lecture isn't really necessary but helps to reinforce concepts.",1
"A nice man, offers extra credit, three exams easy to study for, 3 papers but an easy grader.",1
Worst professor for this class. Love the class material but she assigned way too much work for a gen ed class. Not to mention she basically completely ignored her students when classes became online.,0
"I had Doyle twice this semester for 380 & 420. Both classes were great. Very interesting and informative and quite easy. Both classes entailed 4 quizzes, midterm & final, discussion boards, extra credit, & term papers. I greatly recommend going to the optional class meeting for 380. 15 extra credit points!! Both papers were overwhelming though.",1
"Great professor, enthusiastic about the subject he teaches. Some people say he's hard, but his grading is very fair. Quizzes check to see if you read the textbook. Tests check to see if you understood concepts and terms.  Papers check to see if you get the point of the class. If you don't care, you do badly.  But if you don't care, why do you care?",1
Is awful with technology especially computers! He tells you what will be on the exams but is not really on them. And DO NOT EMAIL HIM! he is a nice guy but shouldn't be able to handle a classroom and make sure he gives you the right office hours,0
"Elementary Logic is very much like Algebra or other forms of math.  If you do not enjoy math or are not good at math, avoid  Elementary Logic.",0
"If you care about your GPA don't take this course. Professor Langer's lectures are informative but vague and his raspy voice sometimes obscures what he is saying. For a good grade on the papers, you must include arbitrary information that he glossed over in class. To do average, never miss a class, and visit him before you hand in any paper.",0
"This is by far my hardest class, he makes it very unclear on what you need to know. Exams are near impossible and there is a ton of them",0
"You have to put in time for this class-you have lengthy articles to ready before every class and there are pop quizzes. However, he reviews what you need to know, and is a very understanding guy. He is also really funny! If you aren't willing to put in the effort, then this will be much harder. No midterm or final, just a project!",1
"PSA: DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!! I am only 5 weeks into the class and I hate it so much. I am a very responsible student and he is an extremely tough grader. I got knocked down a whole letter grade just because in my paper the class name and date were switched. This class is not worth the stress, take this class with another teacher or in person.",0
Worst grading ever. Arbitrarly grades and unfairly distributes grades based on his twisted sense of what is right. Does not teach material and does examples after homework is assigned. If you miss a unit on one term you might lose 40% of a problem. Seriously avoid this professor at all costs. His tests might be easy but a simple slip up can fail.,0
"He is a funny prof. The concepts are pretty clear if you read the textbook and his pre-lecture videos. Both of the midterms were super easy, got a 90 on both. The final exam was kind of tough. But we were allowed to used a doublesided cheat sheet which helped me a lot.",1
Super hot babe,1
"this class is very hard if you don't come to class. sloppy writing on the board. she expects you to know and understand things in just one sitting. boring lectures. easy to fall asleep. the textbook is very dense, must read to understand. i had homework everyday. tests were hard. mandatory attendance.",0
Choosing Dr. Arndt for HIS 395 was a great decision. He is really helpful and cares about his students. He knows his history and will help you narrow down your topic. You have to go to class and to the readings to do well. He makes you work for your grade and isn't going to hand it to you. I got a B but only missed one class all semester. Take him.,1
hard to pass. not a good teacher.,0
I have her this semester for HED 200 very frustrating does not give any material related to the lectures for exams.,0
Great class for an amateur. Ron allows and encourages freedom of thought and expression of one's own opinions. I loved this class!,1
"He is the most disorganized professor, doesn't remember what he has assigned & rushes through new material.  He teaches NEW material that is covered on the test, the DAY of the test.  It's impossible to take notes because he gets easily distracted and his explanations of new topics are  unclear and confusing.  I regret taking this class w/ him.",0
"I found the professor very caring about her students. As for the information, there is lots of it, and the tests were hard. However, professor has been very fair in grading and also has given extra credit to help out. I find her very fair, and the class is very interesting.",1
"Most inconsiderate prof I've ever had. He made a mistake in the syllabus so I emailed him to confirm a due date, submitted the assignment on the due date, but in his email he failed to mention that the assignment was due by a specific time that day. I submitted the 10% assignment an hour late and he refused to accept it. Rude and uncaring man.",0
"Awesome professor, makes the material interesting. Knows her stuff but really nice to",1
"Insall just wants students to do well. He's not a bad guy; he's friendly if you get to know him. His class is a challenge, but I believe people need to be challenged on a daily basis in order to be successful. If you pay attention and study, you will do well, just like in any other class. I recommend Insall for students serious about learning.",1
"Disgustingly horrible professor that knows the class struggles. Didn't teach me a single thing about calculus; learned everything from self textbook use. You WILL struggle on exams which in theory ""reflect what you learn"", but will be so un-ordinary from class and webassign, that you'll spend alot of times in exams figuring out whats going on.",0
"Despite the atrocious grading scale, his class was pretty easy. He lectured for half of the semester while the other half of the semester he had the SC Republican and Democratic State Chairs lecture together or separately. Flower has a wealth of knowledge on American politics and he is a fantastic reference for internships or law school. Take him.",1
"Took her as YOGA 1, she was AWESOME. She isnt very strict, and doesnt over work you. She is caring and sweet. Her class is VERY VERY easy. The only grades are attendance (with make up days), midterm, & final. Easily will boost your GPA. I recommend her(:",1
Did not enjoy this instructor. Learning environment was cold and awkward; did not facilitate class discussion. Many assignments were about students' personal lives.,0
Prof. Richards is great! His exams are exactly like the reviews no surprise questions. Very little homework. Assignments are graded easily. Dont really need to do the readings. Dont buy the textbook. He does show a lot of videos in class. Overall hes a very chill and relaxed prof.,1
Makes class enjoyable and fun,1
"This professor in my opinion had to be one of the nicest and caring people I have met. He continued to be helpful throughout the year and made it his duty to teach important math concepts instead of just the test. I have taken calculus before, but I gained a much greater knowledge than I could have imagined. He is also very helpful in office hours.",1
For humanities she never ever lectured. The whole class was reading and then taking notes to present in a group discussion. We also watched documentaries that she herself had never even seen. When grading she was kind of unfair about it. I had an A in the class the whole time then with the last essay on the final she screwed me over with a B.,0
Cathy Gebotys is the best teacher you'll ever have at The University of Waterloo.  Love you ,1
Barry is really useless. He is very stuck up and is not motivating at all. He is a perfect example of how some university professors just don't care about their students. He makes me NOT want to be in math (which is the opposite of what he is there to do). Advice for Barry; try making your students feel like you care about them and their education.,0
"This class is hard, no lie. Most likely the hardest I've ever taken, but this teacher is one of the most (if not the most) amazing teachers ever. He goes above and beyond to help his students to succeed. If you take Stats and do not take him you are crazy. I did not like stats, but I LOVED his class and enjoyed having him as my professor.",1
This was the most confusing class I have ever taken!  There was no syllabus and I was literally dumbfounded by us having to respond to ten posts!! I didn't really know what was going on half the time because of how the class was structured.  VERY CONFUSING!,0
"She's a real gem, always willing to help outside of class and knows her material extremely well.",1
"Professor Kelley is a great teacher who cares about her students. Most of the negative feedback is probably masked from the fact she's teaching strenuous classes, and people use her as a scape goat. If you don't show up or don't go into office hours for help then you wont get a good grade. ERS is tough in general!",1
"better wish you were dead. if you get him, drop the class. He is definately too smart for his own good.",0
so bad. the guy is not helpful at all.,0
Very kind person who is truly passionate about the subject. He's pretty disorganized when teaching I don't know why but sometimes i feel like he shows up to class unprepared. His quizzes are harder than they should be. If you want to pass this class read the book! He's not awful but I've had way better. ,0
"Hastings is a great guy, really corny. He takes attendance. Lectures are boring. Powerpoints are online. Assignments are easy, he goes over them and moves back the date almost every time. Tests are super easy. Easy A, nice guy, suggest if it is for your major or a breadth requirement. ",1
"You watch movies every class, literally. Don't bother buying the textbook because it'll be useless. You can find all of the Shakespearean plays and soliloquies online. She does let you use the book during the tests, but she also has hers available. You never actually read the Shakespearean plays in class. You just watch the movies.",0
"So my class was originally in person during this year but switch to online since he thought it would be best for us. I didn't really enjoy the in-person version of his class since he would get off topic a lot. When online with his slides and lecture videos, he somehow found a way to get off topic during those. Nice guy, but not suited for teaching",0
"DO NOT take him for lab. I learned the hard way. He grades labs very hard. He's good at explaining at most concepts. Though he does make you feel like you're stupid, when you ask him any question. Just remember...DO NOT take him for lab. You WILL regret it.",1
"I can say that I appreciate her effort in trying make the class engaged, especially now that it's online, but her a bit offputting to the point where it feels like I'm a 5 year old in her kindergarten class. What makes class this MANDATORY attendance class the WORST is tHAT SHE IS TALKING ABOUT THE COURSE OUTLINE IN THE MIDDLE OF FEBRUARY. FOR WHAT",0
"PLEASE DON'T TAKE THIS PROFESSOR! Professor Crumple is very condescending, arrogant, and very rude. He tries to make students feel like they are not smart enough for his class. Sometime in the middle of lectures he goes on tangent about subject not relate to the lecture which could be very confusing. He take pleasure to see his students fail",0
"an absolute **** to most men, mark many easier than others",0
Does anyone know where Claudia is teaching now?  I think Dalhousie in Nova Scotia? Would like to use as reference. Thanks,1
"She's crazy, but awesome...",1
"This guy is terrible. Very condescending and flat out disrespectful to some students. I once counted the times he said ""obvious"" in class, the total was 35. Given, the material is not difficult, but almost every question is a stupid one to him. Puts stuff on exams that he never goes over in class or even talks about, definitely avoid.",0
3 tests count for 50% of total grade. Was worried but the practice tests are exactly the same as the actual tests. Fine workload with multiple attempts allowed on homework and quizzes. Uses Thinkwell instead of a textbook. Material is taught concisely and well. Prof was understanding through emails. Probably the best math class I've ever taken.,1
One of the nicest Professors I have ever had. Dr. Madsen is very knowledgable about his subject and cares about his students. If you put in the effort and ask for help he will ensure you pass. He allows test corrections for half points back on one exam. Lectures are boring but worth going to because he mentions things that will be on the exam.,1
Her bb page is atrocious to navigate. All assignments given are quizzes. Videos of instruction on class outdated And of terrible quality. No makeups. Extremely harsh at grading. Ive spent weeks studying and she will still mark down the slightest errors. I put more time into this class just to get nothing for grades. Many students also did poorly.,0
Its a waste of time,0
"He's a good guy, but a lot of what he teaches is hard to understand because of the way he teaches it. I strongly recommend having a background coding before taking this class, otherwise it'll be hard!",0
"No study guides, likes to trick students on tests. No extra credit, doesn't care if you learn or not. Bad accent and hates it when you don't understand what he is saying. Do not take him!!!! Nightmare!",0
"Dr. Cochrane is extremely smart and makes lectures interesting if your interested in the subject.  Class is necessary to go to because she doesn't post notes anywhere.  Great Professor, study and it's an easy A.",1
Amazing professor that really cares about your education.,1
You will need the textbook as he gives the two midterms and final exam reviews by giving you the page numbers and concepts of what to study. He gave basic criteria for the group projects and feedback afterwards on what could've been done better. Exam was one essay question which he gave out beforehand. The two midterms were multiple choice.,1
amazing professor!,1
"This is the worst class, she makes you write 9 papers, learn 66 muscles & bones & if you miss one letter its wrong. The final was 63 ?s & confusing. HPEA stands for activity not nutrition, English, or nursing. She doesnt know how to teach that clas, its 2 creds not 4 were suppose to work out, you dont learn that part right Horrible class dont take",0
"its very easy to get A in his class, I just attend his lecture and finish the HW in time, I didn't do anything else to get extra practice , and easily A for me.",1
excellent teacher.,1
Very poor communication. He doesn't even seem to care about what you learn or that your learn.  Web based learning is bad enough in Accounting but to have a teacher that doesn't communicate and help you out before the tests - makes things even worse.  I feel I have self taught what little I am taking away from this particular class.,0
"What can I say, a lot of the students that he had in his class were people that were in there several times. And I see why - he is not clear nor is he very helpful. You have to have some idea of what you are doing in his class, or you will fail.",0
Down to earth teacher. Clear teaching methods. Do your homework and study the textbook and you will pass.,1
"Despite being in the midst of a pandemic, the class examinations turned into a set of quizzes which in turn is not a great way to administer exams. Furthermore, he doesn't curve.",0
"Truly an unnecessarily tough grader. During the corona virus crisis she did not lower her expectations of us, and additionally stated during class time that she would spend less time grading our work and would give us fewer comments on how to improve. Though through her words she acted sympathetic to her students, her actions spoke otherwise.",0
She was thrown into this course and has absolutely no knowledge about any of the content being taught. She brings in other profs as 'guest lecturers' to teach her class. She forced us to get Twitter accounts to see updates about assignments yet she's barely used it. She's unclear and a hard marker. Exam questions were incomplete. Fels ya later.,0
If you need a syllabus and clear guidelines for your classes then skip him. He tends to operate in grey areas. The class is a guaranteed A as long as you do the projects. You don't need to read or show up if you don't want. His lectures are very interesting though and worth showing up for. He gets you to think in a different way on some topics.,1
I really enjoyed her class. She's very friendly and even takes the initiative to learn her students' names. I understand her teaching style is not for everyone. She basically assigns readings and she discusses it in class. She also assigns 2 papers and 2 blue book tests. For each test she gives you one question in advance. Pretty easy class to me.,1
"Worst teacher I've had at UT, confusing and hard to understand when he talks. All you do all semester is write essays for him which he grades impossibly. Adds random assignments not on the syllabus that are due the same night. Avoid if you can",0
"Unwilling to meet outside of class, Grades well, Harsh personality , Not for freshman",0
Truly a life changing class,1
He gives incredibly long lectures that are not engaging. NR001 was a joke. Not enjoyable at all. I would recommend that if you want to be in Rubenstein that you start freshman year as undeclared and then transfer into Rubenstein sophomore year. That way you only have to take one class as a transfer student as opposed to NR001 and NR002.,0
"Professor Cao has an excellent teaching style! His accent is difficult to understand at first, however you can defiantly over come this obstacle... you are in engineering remember! I took MEC309 in winter 2017 where Dr. Cao was the course coordinator.  The best part about Dr. Cao ... He took three in class problems and put them on the final exam!!!",1
"She expect you write anything she say in class with speed of light! and ask them in exams. I saw my native English classmates couldn't write her lecture. lots of advise, good but not related to business. If you are international student not good in English Language avoid her class, must relay on your studying and you cannot learn anything in class",0
The hardest professor I have ever taken. She doesn't really care if her students fail and you will never get an A on anything. Gives insane amounts of work and acts like this is the only class you are taking. Extremely disorganized. Please don't take her,0
Terrible instructor. No teaching ability.  Complains constantly.  Does not know how to use basic technology. Rude and unhelpful.,0
"What a boring and horrible professor. He just stands there behind the podium using powerpoint. While not a philosophy major, I need a good background in this stuff for my further studies, but this guy basically made me HATE philosophy. He attempted it cram way too much complicated material in one semester. might be nice, but he stinks as a teachers",0
Just memorize random facts from his book and you will do fine on the exams - if you have sharp memorization skills. There's actually little to no actual learning about NUTRITION in this class. It's basically Biochemistry 2.0. I am disappointed because the instructor failed at articulating the material in lectures. Just memorize his book.,0
Doesn't know what he's doing. Disorganized for every class,0
"Professor Leslie Looney is honestly amazing. I would call this my first positive experience with a science class!  In addition to being truly GOOD at teaching, he makes class interesting.  I literally lol almost every period.  LOONEY FOREVER!!!",1
Amazing guy and teacher. He is funny and easy going and someone who actually cares about his students passing. He may spend a bit of time on examples but it is needed for a spreadsheet question. He shows you how to use Excel and take the easy way of calculating the problems instead of you using a calculator. More professors need to learn from him.,1
Dr. Warner is nice and cares for her students. The class was pretty difficult and you have to study a lot to do well on tests. The final exam was easier than all the other exams. She provides a lecture outline so you don't have to write so much which is nice. She gives a lot of resources to study for tests You have homework almost every week online,1
Really tough tests and grader. I write A papers for the enligh department but for her I could not get anything above B-. You can write everything to her standards and still get really poor grades.,0
"Not very helpful when taking his online class- he only answers some questions that are asked, and even then he is kind of rude about it!",0
"He is really funny and willing to bend to students wants and needs...""test too hard?  He'll make it a take home""  Super nice, and I actually learned something.  I am definately taking him for my next class.",1
Easiest professor ever! Doesn't want to teach. Cancelled class many times. When we did have class he only kept us for maybe an hour. Tests were like what I had in 8th grade. It's all textbook. Take this class for an easy A. Don't take it to learn.,0
one of the worst prof's Ive ever had.,0
"Phil is an awesome TA. He doesn't grade the essay very hard and quizzes are easy. The class is nothing but powerpoints but he talks about his personal experiences with some of the topics and also goes into more detail with some things. Very goofy and makes class fun. Don't take his attitude as snobby or rude, he's probably trying to crack a joke.",1
"This class was definitely a waste of time, prof is really boring to listen to, hard to concentrate. Heard enough about how he worked at IBM back in the day. Only reason to show up is for clicker questions.",0
"Ian is a really nice guy. But he only touches the surface of each concept. When you ask for more details, he doesn't know them. That's good for those who just want to pass the course, since he teaches easy and has great lectures. He tries to avoid tougher questions and does not follow up, but expects you to read up on it yourself.",0
"A very nice person and a great teacher. Organized and knowledgeable. Always ready to help students. She wont move on with the lecture unless she has clarified your doubts. Best Professor I have ever had. Take her course, you will learn a lot and that too with ease. ",1
he is so cute! he reminds me of my grandpa and i just want to hug him (but i don't). take him - it will make you happy.,1
Excellent professor! Offers plenty of help...if you ask for it :),1
"Easy A as long as you do your work. You do have to participate though, because there's a grade for it. She's a great teacher, 100% recommend.",1
"Great Teacher! He's very passionate about teaching.  If you dont know how to write essays do not take his class.  He makes you a better student not only learning history, but also makes sure that your English is proper.  Very knowledgable and he keeps you engaged in his lectures.Lots of notes, but he is really straightforward",1
"This is a difficult subject, but he knows what he's talking about and explains it well. Still, you're only gonna get an ""A"" if you truly understand the material and that means studying a lot. He's very accommodating, but you're graded on performance not effort. So, a B or C is doable, but the A you really gotta earn. Overall Excellent teacher.",1
"Saas is a real gem, always make corny jokes throughout the semester. Show up to class, if no excuse then 10 deduction. Just do what is asked, meet his requirements for speeches and turn things in on time, then you'll end up with an A+. Super chill and laid back. (PS. NO MIDTERM/FINAL)",1
Excellent online courses. Very approachable and understanding. Assignments are time-consuming but very useful. Will definitely take more of her courses in the future (I have had three of hers).,1
"Not helpful. Extremely Hard marker with stupid multiple choice selections like ""C. None of the above D. None of them apply"". Makes you do your whole group project on D2L which is extremely inconvenient and inefficient. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS.",0
"She is super nice and always willing to help, you definitely have to work for that class and math center is really helpful in order to do good. Not much grading on homework, however quizzes every week.",1
Such a boring class. Tests are almost impossible and takes forever to grade.,0
Lesley is great. shes super helpful and really talented!! i had her as my lab instuctor for photo 001 and i took her 49A field studies class. she is the best! i recommend her fer sure!!!,1
"Clarity, precision, excitement, intensity, and dynamic control: everything this man disregards with the RU marching band. Unclear with his commands, overly loud brass and percussion.  No musicality--something that should really be worked on by SECTION LEADERS and members alike. Pride of New Jersey? Give me a break, Mr. Smith. Must be fired. NOW.",0
"This was my second time taking the class. She is very sweet and goes around helping you after lecture. She gives you a very good review sheet before the tests and HW isn't mandatory, but you need to do it for hw quizes which help with getting points. Take her.",1
"Professor Addi is a very knowledgable person, and it shows! He might seem intimidating at first, but he is actually very nice. Not afraid to speak his mind. Overall, he was a great teacher and I would take him again.  P.S. Easy A ",1
"Very knowledgeable about the subject matter, but lacks commitment to the class and appears unreliable. An A is  realistic, if you give a decent effort. His lackadasical attitude toward the class (several missed classes), poor communication) have the ability to make you lazy. You just have to remain focused throughout the semester.",1
"Ning dosent teach.  You have to be able to study and learn the material on your own.  Attendance is a must, due to the fact you have in class work sheets you have to do everyday for credit.  You can work with a partner on the material and when your done you can leave.  I would not recommend this class if you can not learn math on your own.",0
"Great teacher who gives great, concise and useful lectures. He tells you what is important and makes the 3 hour lectures bearable by giving breaks and making jokes.",1
She was a great professor and I had a great time in her class.,1
"Becker was good 20 years ago, I ma told by my parents. but since he is in his 80s, he often does not know what is going on.  It is frustrating to the students he has now. All of us will get old and we understand.  The university has been trying for years to gently retire him. He has a 1950s mental pic of matters. ",0
"Birx is one of the most remarkable teachers I've found at Canisius. He is betrothed in the material and the students. No matter the student or project, he was always able to find the redeeming qualities of a firearm and the areas where the student could push their work. On a personal level, Birx was one of my most influential instructors.",1
"""Uncle Bob"" is an excellent professor- very humorous and candid, keeps students engaged. While you could probably just learn from the book, his insights and connections in class are valuable. Final project challenging but very useful. Exams are not difficult if you prepare; offers ""incentive plan"" to improve grades.",1
"Very engaging professor, but can be tough to follow at times. Take good notes, because he doesn't share his slides - but there is no need to copy the slides down verbatim.  He uses a lot of real-world examples from his work in the lectures, which helps make things clear. ",1
"The course itself depends on how much programming you already know. For me it was none and this class made me take it as a major. Lori's lectures WILL be dry if you're not into the subject. Otherwise. Her explanations were aimed perfectly, she was really helpful in office hours and overall just a really great prof.",1
"Worst professor ever! Unfair marking, doesn't speak clearly and writing is not readable. He is very lazy and hates helping; most of the time directing people to the TA. He's also a hypocrite, demanding use of very specific language yet is very ambiguous and inconsistent himself. Avoid! It isn't worth having him, even if the course material is good.",0
"Also, the lectures are very boring. He thinks we are dumb and we don't know anything. He makes us feel like we are uneducated students. I have never felt so low in my life, I have always gotten A's in college except for his class. I recommend to him, respect your students because without students you are not a teacher.",0
"She is an amazing prof, her lectures were amazing and despite being a T and R class, the classes felt very short. She does mark quite hard on her exams and essays.  You can't skip class, she won't post the notes. And study the book like the crazy.",1
"Worst teacher! I took him for A&P 1. Its hard to understand him at first but eventually you pick up what he's saying. Yes, his homework is unlimited but he gives you like 70 questions, each question has 15+ parts. Gives you a review of 200 questions a week before exam and expects you to know them all for 150 question test.",0
"HATED thus class. The professor teaches about how to teach students with learning disabilities, yet when you ask for help all she does is tells you to go to the student disability center. I would never recommend her.",0
run away. take a different history class.,0
"I love History.  I did all of the work and studied hard.  BUT this class was difficult to feel successful in.  Shelvey's lectures are inspirational, not because of the content, but because he offers practical applications for transforming today's society.   Loved going to classes, not d-groups.  He didn't give us time to talk or foster discussion.",1
"Rambles on lectures and jumps around topics. Most things we did or he talked about didn't tie into the topic we were on. Don't have to take notes, won't know what to note down. Even though i didn't really learn much, easy A just do the study guide and study it. Can make up tests. If you want to really learn A&P take someone else otherwise very easy",0
"He gives way too much work for his class, is a very hard grader, gave two midterms, ended up with a crappy grade. Equivalent effort would have resulted in passing two other courses with an A+.",0
"His music 2300 class is my favorite class ever at Pulaski Tech. I was just checking to see if he has any other classes. I'm not sure I'd like French especially with the comments, but he sure knows music. The grading is always fair. No tests just  papers. It's hard to not do well if you just turn in something. The music discussions are the best.",1
"Lectures are boring and he is hard to hear, make sure you write down basically everything he says, the lecture slides are impossible to understand and don't provide useful information unless you write down what he says in addition. Your TA is crucial, do all the grading. DONT get Nathan Braccio he is impossible to reason with and grades SO tough",0
Good lord he will give you the biggest stack of reading in the world.  DO THE READING. DO THE READING OR YOU WILL NOT DO WELL. He's a cool guy and has interesting things to say. Also he has a really nice dog that he walks around campus. ,1
"I have never been more miserable in lecture in my life. As a consequence, I almost completely stopped attending class. Still got an A-.",0
"Don't like reading the news? Tough nuts, cause you gonna learn today. She sounds like she talks to herself more than us and she'll definitely teach you that listening is hard. She gives clear cut feedback on speech assignments so you'll know how to improve as you go along. She made us get textbooks we DID NOT need. She steps on some people's toes",1
He is the best prof you can ever get for physics. He makes you fall in love with it.,1
Easy going professor. He never gives back your grades or post on Bb. Might seem like an easy A but must keep track of your grade by urself. If not you will get something different from what you think u will get. If u really want to learn spanish not a good choice. Everything mostly take home but make sure to ask what u get!! Be on top of ur grades.,0
"Dr. Lombardo is a very nice guy and is very clear in explaining the material. He does have a tendency to fumble his words on occasion. He also tends to just expect students to know certain things. For example, in lab when we captured a frog, one student asked ""How can you tell its a green frog?"" and he honestly said ""Because it just is."" ",1
weird grader on papers and is very closed minded about environmental ideas,0
"You are expected to already know linear algebra, dirac notation and any other math required for quantum mechanics. He will half (at most) work through problems or concepts and then not understand why you aren't ""getting it"". He can be a nice guy and will take some extra time during office hours. He can be short and condescending.",0
"She is actually one of the few UNDERrated professors in UNCC and possibly among the most articulate in her field. I disagreed with much of what she said (feminist, AA yada), but she did much to shape my thought and approach to lit. She is pretty open-minded. I wrote a paper in which I bashed an author unmercifully (but truthfully).Got an A anyway.",1
"He is a horrible teacher.  DO NOT TAKE HIM! The course is interesting but this guy is a stiff who thinks he knows it all.  You will leave this class so confused and end up with a grade that definitely deserves to be better than what you actually get.  Don't get me wrong, he's a funny guy but not worth it.",0
Prof. Gaffin always covers EVERY part of the reading in the textbook to ensure that everyone knows whats going on. He is inspirational and makes an hour and 15 minute lecture weirdly entertaining. He is the best and I would not want any other prof. for that class.,1
"really nice and caring guy, except his class is very difficult. lectures are hard to sit through because he just talks and doesn't use slides and doesn't encourage notes and rather you just read the textbook outside of class. no phones!! to put things in perspective i think i would've ended up with a C if it weren't for covid putting school online.",0
"Not good. Doesnt explain material very well, gets confused by the information himself. Doesnt do enough examples and usually stands there and points at the power point. Only uses mymathlab ppts. to teach. Tests are the majority of the grade, there's only 3. MyMathLab assignments barely count toward your grade, so if youre a bad test taker, beware.",0
Best professor I've ever taken. I loved coming to her classes and her choice of reading assignments. Easy A.,1
Worst class i have ever taken,0
"He won't make it easy, but you'll lean a lot. He really teaches you to read fine details in every sentence that will make your writing and grammar so much better. He's much more effective at it than any other teacher or professor in the past. I definitely would have benefited greatly from taking this class before my first internship.",1
"I give Rafla an F+ for effort.  Phones in the lectures, gets back grades when he's good and ready, and is all over the board in regards to testing.  Good luck spending 5-10 hours per week on lab work OUTSIDE of lab section.  Good news is he's the only one who teaches this terrible class!",0
"Tough class, his lectures are long and he stumbles on his words a lot. Loves to use graphs and clalculus so if your not great at math don't take this class",0
He doesn't take attendance. Is very passionate about what he is teaching. Very understanding and fair. I would recommend.,1
"I like Nakajima. He is accessible, he's understanding, and he actually teaches. I didn't like this class at all. I thought that his teaching methods were not very useful. Most of the class agreed, and by the end, almost no one was showing up to lectures. The tests leave no room for error, but he offered extra credit on both after so many failed.",0
"Took his 230 class (precovid) and now I'm at UCSC, and my upper div biochem series has been SO EASY because of this man. He makes you work for an A, but its bc he cares and wants u to do well post-transfer. I would *NOT* being doing as well as I am in my biochem series w/o this man!! If your taking any biochem post-transfer: TAKE STAPLE'S CLASS!!!",1
She's a cool teacher. Very passionate. Just do your work and she'll help you. But you gotta do your work though. Would recommend Ms. Hayden to anybody.,1
"He prepared us so well that when I went to Fresno State, in some of my courses, I had to wait for the rest of the class to learn what Mr. Gervasi had already taught us! Fourier series, PDEs, and contour integrals are a few examples. Sad to hear he left because he was the best at explaining complex concepts and I almost changed my major to math.",1
"I have never once had any issues with any professors at Clark, but Jamey Marsh is not one that I would recommend taking. I would not say that Professor Marsh cares about his students success because he purposefully sets you up to fail. He is not helpful when it comes to trying to understand what you got wrong, and you only pass because of the curve",0
cool,1
I loved Profesora Rashid! She's sweet and really insightful about Spanish literature. This class exposes you to a broad array of Spanish genres and writing styles from different time periods which I appreciated. Try engaging in class and coming prepared having read the textbook readings because that's what lecture is completely built around.,1
The class was extremely difficult. Extra credit was given sometimes in class randomly. There were a couple group projects with your lab benches. I studied so much for her tests and read the textbook but still got around 60-70s on her test. There's a lot of grades though so it doesn't hurt your average extremely bad. You need to put in work.,0
"Very disorganized, seemed very gender biased and not a fair grader.",0
"Dr Narby is a very interesting teacher. I loved his class. I agree with all the other posts about his tests though, they are a little rough but the extra credit questions really help out.",1
He's not as bad as some people say. Just get used to his style. Find his video-lectures on iTunesU - they were very helpful. Answering questions is not his strong suit - can't answer to the point.  But I like the way he structured his course although I had to either read the book or find some other learning materials and read after each lecture,1
She is a horrible teacher! She is never happy or smiles. Always serious and treats her students like they are in high school. Her test are much harder than what is on her slides or talks in class. Don't like her attitude as a teacher.,0
"This class was full of interesting content. The professor was a little forgetful at times, but overall a very nice person who was clearly very passionate about the subjects. I would recommend this class to fulfill the ethnic studies requirement or just for fun!",1
"HW you have to read 12 page articles then answer relatively easy questions on them. The quizzes are straight from the book and have only a little overlap with lecture. You do not get the answers back for the quizzes to study for the test. Read the chapters to do good on the tests, I didn't and suffered. Avoid this course.",0
"For someone who teaches about accommodating students with disabilities, he sure hates accommodating students with disabilities. Every email was met with blunt and rude responses. No flexibility, harsh grading policies, vague instructions. I thought it was just me because of his super high rating on here, but if you feel this way, you're not alone",0
"Very nice and helpful professor. As long as you put time and effort into the homework and lectures, you'll pass with at least a B with no problems.",1
"I only had him for a one-credit course but I still appreciated his sense of humor and ability to treat students as adults. Nice man, and clear grader.",1
"Definitely not worth the hype. The professor was hella dry and I did not find this class interesting at all. His lectures and extremely boring. I found his essay topics unclear, and some of the readings were just so tedious and inconvenient. The class is graded on very little things so your grade is very dependent on each test.",0
"Man, his class was disappointing. He engaged the class pretty well at the beginning but lost it half way through. After the midterm, lectured continued but there wasn't a final exam... so his lectures were quite pointless. On the bright side, the work load was EASY for a 3rd year class, fewf.. He's not on blackboard, didn't like that. I would avoid",1
"Noreen is really passionate about Economics and tends to go on tangents, but is very comical now and then. She is very student centered, but at the same time expects a lot from students. Exams are short answer and multiple choice and has online homework and quizzes due every Sunday. She is helpful, but you have to study to succeed. ",1
"She is boring. Students talk while she is lecturing and she can't control her class. She is a great person, just not teacher material. She is not punctual. We don't get started until like 40 minutes into the class period. I really like her as a person and she is a great social worker!",0
languages are hard in general and french is no different and requires constant homework everyday bur erica is an absolute gem and amazing teacher who cares about her students and the subject she teaches.,1
Nothing,0
If you LOVE knowing the chapter down to the punctuation take Edwards. She often pulls questions for her tests that are from a chapter that isn't supposed to be on the test. Oh yeah and she doesn't teach. Expects you to learn outside of class and ask questions in class.. Why? I'm not paying you for that Im paying for you to teach. So teach Edwards!!,0
Be prepared to do a lot of self study to get through this class. Labs are unnecessarily hard and time consuming but exams are not too bad since they are based on earlier exams posted on his website. A good 40% of my class is GONE and just dropped out from the beginning of the year. Good luck all.,0
"If you're even a second late to class you're marked absent (which I get not being late, but I only had 10 minutes to get across campus to this class). It messes with your financial aid. He talks too low; you cannot hear a word he's saying unless you're in the first few rows. He reads straight from the notes, no enthusiasm..",0
"she's just... a no. I like the course but she was so unlikeable that she made it hard for you to appreciate the course. if you're expecting an easy grade, skip this class because she wants specific answers on the exams that we barely went over in class and the smallest details in the readings.",0
You really should take lab with this guy! One of the funniest professors I've ever had. Half the time you don't even do the lab and he grades you on TAKE HOME tests! You rarely stay over an hour and a half!,1
"He does care about his students, but you have to really read and study what he assigns. If you don't, the class will be extremely difficult for you. Participation is huge and he likes it when you engage in conversations about the topic. His powerpoints aren't perfect, but they are useful for the exams.",1
Bob is the best teacher ever! I took his class 8 years ago and still remember stuff he said. I wish every teacher was like him!,1
"the worst ever. she makes the course so so so hard. also, she challenges the students. She feels satisfies if the student can't answer her quizzes or exams.",0
"It's been over 20 years since I took his classes, and I still googled Prof. Forrest to see how he's doing. He is that great a lecturer; And a very pleasant person. Delighted to see he's still at it, and, judging by the reviews, as good as ever.",1
"I took this course and followed it with her ECO 152 course, I could not have asked for a more understanding professor. Even in her online section, she was willing to work with me when I had to leave the state at the last minute and finish the course from across the country. She gives her students every opportunity to succeed.",1
"Dr. Koh gives well-prepared lectures but expects students to use their brains.  The homework and programming assignments require considerable time spent in thought.  Additionally, his exams can be tough.  However, he cares about the students and has an open-door policy for his office.",1
"She gives A LOT of homeowrk, most of it is just busy work and pointless. A lot of class discussion, so if she calls on you and you dont know the answer she makes you feel uncomfortable. Dont take her!!!!",0
"I am a Semester 4 student of the paralegal education program and Ms. Pemberton is by far the very worst teacher at Humber College. She is very anal, she does not mark your valiant efforts well, and she is far too strict. Take another else for Criminal Summary Convictions and your grades will be great!",0
"This class is Boring! She quizzes on material that was not gone over and doesn't explain things very well. Also, she makes the final 30% of your grade so good luck!",0
Awesome professor and one of the  best experiences I have had so far at a Math class in UT. His lectures are really helpful and fun and most of the questions on the quizzes and tests are the ones that he has solved in class. Make sure to take notes as it helps a ton during tests and quizzes.,1
Nicest. Prof. Ever.,1
"Nice guy, his lectures are difficult to understand but thats because the subject matter is quite abstract. If you read his textbook you should understand the subject. His tests and exams are really really very easy. If you practice that is.",1
"Great teacher for a beginner class.  Explains everything pretty clearly, but any additional questions are given vauge answers that make you figure the rest out for yourself.  Quizes are fairly straitforward and easy but everything is graded very hard. She makes the class a lot of fun though.",1
"I have to be honest, the class was a little boring.  The guy did have favorites.  He didnt return emails very promptly.  If you take him, ask him what to write about in advance, because he wont tell you exactly what he wants till you get your paper back.  Overall, not too bad.",1
Dr. Chen is THE BEST professor I have ever had. Although calculus can be difficult he is more than willing to make sure each student succeeds. You just have to take the initiative and ask for help or go to office hours. He is so nice and I can't wait to take him again!,1
"Very weird man, and he is a huge creeper (loves flirting with girls!) He may be smart, but he is unable to teach. He needs some serious help. With him teaching, it shows how concerned UW is with their teachers --- they dont care!",0
"This class is intellectually demeaning and should not be required. I have learned absolutely nothing that I did not already learn in high school or in my other intro-level SPEA classes. The course is only challenging in the sense there are so many small, petty assignments that are easy to forget and honestly taking them is offensive as a student.",0
Hard class but Crawley makes things very interesting!,1
"I have to say this guy is super smart, very helpful, and extremely nice! Yet lectures drag on and if you ask a question he goes on and on until you cant even remember what we were supposed to be talking about. Sprouts knowledge like a sprinkler that can be unappealing at times. Workload is heavy (reading wise) and exams are difficult but he grades ",1
"Very hard, lots of reading. Lectures are really boring...he tends he go off on tangents alot. Thought I was in a history class, not an english class half the time. Very critical when grading essays. Take another teacher if you can.",0
Assignments are mysterious. Grading is unfair. This professor is one of the worst I have ever had!,0
"If youre about to take AP with this Professor, BUCKLE UP! Professor Sexton is an amazing teacher that youll learn a lot from but this is the hardest class Ive ever taken! It is AP so thats expected but I BARELY made a B with a 79 in her lec and lucky a 85 in a different lab! Her exams are HARD! She wants u to succeed tho & will help in anyway!",1
"The class is easy enough, she's very clear about the characters she wants you to create and there's a big group critique at the end of every character makeup application you'll do for her and she gives good feedback.",1
Hilarious teacher.  Makes the class fun.  His tests are pretty hard--study the powerpoints and all of your notes.  i didnt use the book for this class.  Go to class on review days!  it helps a lot!,1
"A solid professor, but a bit old-school. Homework due prior to lecture on the topic and his way of lecturing is not for everyone. Rather than have a formal outline, he relies on your questions to formulate the lecture. I wish he was more structured and possibly even use slides or lecture guides, but overall, I enjoyed the class and learned a lot.",1
He's a very good teacher. Grades papers harder as the year goes on but makes sure to help you get better at writing papers as long as you try to do better. Very helpful. I never worry about writing papers for classes now. ,1
great guy..One thing I have to say He's door is always open and he is always willing to help you with music stuff and with anything your need help in.,1
"Basically, she's alright, pretty good actually.  Just make sure you attend class everyday...I mean it.  If you do, you don't need to do ANY readings, just listen to her examples.  Gives study guides, online notes are pretty much useless, but it's pretty decent if you put a bit of work in.",1
"She can't speak English. No matter how you put it, she's not helpful b/c she dos not have a clear grasp on the English language. She's a nice person and all, but good luck when you ask her a question with too many long words.",0
Her class was amazing and she teaches you from the minimal basics. It really did teach me a lot and gave me something to look forward to twice a week. She was very nice. An easy A.,1
Avoid him!!!!!!!!,0
Class is graded on 3 exams and the final. Take notes in class and throughout the book. No homework given. Does give study guide.,1
"Great prof! Goes thru material a bit slow, but in general an amazing prof. If you have the option to get him , seize it.",1
"I love Professor Tompson. She really cares about her classes and is overly animated during 8 AM lectures. She is the only professor I know who always has the first row full of students eager to learn. Her tests are easy and she asks questions in a way that makes sure you understand the information, but they aren't trick questions. Would take again!",1
"Would not recommend. Makes the material extremely dull and boring. Do not take this class with her. Often she is rude and condescending in class. Tests are hard, but manageable. ",0
"Dr Self gives lectures with a lot of energy and I swear he has ADD. Study the slides and do the test review throughly. Random clicker questions on previous material. Gives test reviews before the exam but only talks about questions asked to him, so ask!! The class wasn't nearly as hard as I thought it would be.",1
I liked having this teacher for theatre class it was fairly easy as long as you attended class and stayed awake. She is very outspoken and will call on you in a heartbeat if you are texting or sleeping in her class.,1
"His psychological investigation in lit class is great! Extremely nice and friendly person. Very lenient and fair on grading. Just do your work and you'll be good. I would recommend taking any of his classes, they are very interesting and informative. My favorite professor as well.",1
"Do not take this class under any circumstances. He's a tough and extremely unfair grader. You'll worry more about getting good grades than actually learning the material. Like other reviews have said, he wants your essays to match his ideals perfectly. Even if it's an opinion based piece, you're wrong if you don't agree with him 100%.",0
"This class is a joke. Lectures do not make sense and is him just going on and on about some rant. Have to make 86% on final not matter if your overall grade is an A. So basically, nobody gets an A because his tests are all hypothetical. He clearly knows a lot about biology, but he does not know how to deliver that information without ranting.",0
His class was good and bad. He goes over the material but he goes over everything too quickly. before I get to the second step he's on the next problem. He explains things too but sometimes he just breezes by them as if they don't matter. Tests are fairly easy and he posts practice tests online. Grades homework on accuracy.,0
He's an AMAZING prof. Do MUN with him.,1
"Doesn't care about Deadlines. Takes A MONTH to mark midterms and forget about getting grades on time! Christmas marks don't arrive until January. Doesn't explain projects and assignments AT ALL. You don't know how you're doing 'til the end, when you can't change anything. Readings are horrible.",0
"Dr Kean is a very kind person, and very musically talented. He does care about his students, but he cares most for the music. He'll treat you like an adult if you act like one, and if you show up and give an honest effort, you'll have an A at the end of the semester. I, honestly am thankful to have him as my prof, he's made me a much better singer.",1
"One of the more entertainIng classes I've had. 2 essay tests straight from the readings (which are dry), two 3 page papers, and a conference review. He's unapologetically himself, which tends towards the self-congratulating, unhelpful side of things. I don't think anything else could be said but that I would definitely without a doubt take it again",0
"He gets pretty upset at times, but as long as you're on his good side it's okay. I thought I deserved a higher grade, but didn't receive it due to a ""mix-up""",0
Couldn't understand a thing he talked about all semester. Doesn't help his students. Horrible. He will let you out early but thats about it. You can go to all the tutoring in the world and show up to his classes. Even when he clearly sees your trying he wills till fail you. Avoid.,0
"Professor Ross started doing TopHat for attendance this semester, he is super annoying, however, his class is not hard, and he gives out points like they're candy. Just show up, don't pay attention, and study the Revel Questions for the tests, and you'll be fine. He is so annoying, but if you're looking for an easy humanities he's a good choice.",1
Dr. Wood is a great guy! He's a really tough grader and doesn't take anyone's bs. Give a few extra credit points here and there. But don't underestimate the attendance points for class and lab! Make sure your group works well together you will be a team all semester! Lecture tests are extremely tough but lab isn't so bad.,1
Not very helpful...,0
Very strict professor AVOID him.,0
Amazing class and professor. She posts her lectures online but it's best to attend her classes since there are many things she omits in her notes. Her classes are definitely worth taking.,1
Aren't we supposed to read and study in college? This is a great class for anyone SERIOUS about becoming a good nurse or health professional. A friend in nursing school recommended Professor Jones. I'm glad I took her class. It helped improve study and reading skills that I have to use in nursing school. Exams were straight out of the book.,1
"He is not a bad teacher, but he is not good if you have no interest really in Computer Science.",1
Worst professor I've ever had. He makes you read long articles that are barley related to the topic of the class and spends most of the time talking about something that isn't the main point of the article. When grading either a test or an essay he looks for key words he expects. If you use a synonym to the word he wanted no credit.,0
"LisaMarie Luccioni is the best professor I have ever had, hands down. She is a tough grader but is 100% fair and she really makes you work for your As. She is an amazing professor as well as an amazing person and if you have the opportunity to work with her, you absolutely should. Her class is not hard as long as you follow the speech formula!!",1
"The WORST professor I have ever had to this date, By Far!! Not only is she unfair (especially with those participation marks) but I honestly believe that she does not have a sweet clue. I have never been more disappointed with a course.",0
"Great professor, really funny in a nerdy way. Tons of reading assigned but if you do a majority of it you will be fine. Take his class!",1
I took Ancient Western Philosophy with Prof. Shartin. I was extremely excited about the class until I had him. He is never organized and gave the exact same notes every day. Then didn't understand why 75 percent of the class failed his first quiz when none of the questions pertained to the notes he gave. Steer clear if you like organization.,0
Had for General Biology. Awesome professor! Class is mandatory to get notes but tests are straight forward not too tricky. If you have the option TAKE HIM!!! Excellent!,1
She was all over the place!,0
"Overall, this was an easy course material wise. She goes at a good pace and there's a good balance between french and english. She was also helpful to most students as long as they put in some effort. The only thing I don't like about her is that she embarrasses people in front of the class and says rude comments, which are unnecessary.",1
"So basically the tests were not supposed to be Aleks based. She did that in order to prevent cheating (Aleks has webcam and lockdown browser). This class wouldn't be that material heavy if it was in-person. Do not wild about grades only, she hates it. But let's be real, aleks helped many people pass the course that wouldn't in the first place.",1
very hard final,1
"She teaches really fast and when you don't understand something, she'll be like ""WHAT?  what DON'T you understand?""  A little confusing at times, but she'll help you.  A little short tempered.  Her tests are alright, no trick questions.  She emphasizes on the stuff that's going to be on the tests.  She makes you practice the problems a lot.",1
"I never want to see the Gong show again. As a person, I guess she's ok. As a teacher, well, my motivation to pass was to never take a course with her again.",0
Very good teacher and has a great approach to class and the lesson each day. Very understanding and down to earth while being professional at the same time.,1
"I had her back when she was a teaching student. I don't know how, but I left high school with a D in English & left BC an English major w/honors. Now a gainfully employed writer. I owe it to her for helping me find my voice. She introduced me to the world of writing & literature that changed my life. After 20 yrs I still remember that first day.",1
Managerial Econ is a rehash of Microeconomic and statistical evaluation. As an Economics major I breezed through majority of the work (a lot of it was review). Hui does an excellent job in paying attention to all student needs. She slows instruction for those who are having trouble with material. Office hours available and helpful.,1
really tough marker!,1
Don't waste your time if you actually want to learn.Very unclear and does not grade assignments for a long time and no feedback whatsoever.A shame he's the only social work teacher there because people are forced to take him.,0
"Loved Mrs. Hutton! She cares for her students and their success. However, she makes you work for your grade, HW every night and tests about every 2 weeks. The tests are very confusing; they are filling the blanks (10-15) & 3-4 short answers. Other than that I loved her personality & the way she teaches to the point Im now taking Special Ed with her",1
DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. The class is online and all she does is post 2-4 short lecture videos that she recorded from last year for an entire 2-3 week unit. Her lectures have nothing to do with exams so basically if you do not read and take notes from all of the chapters on the book you are going to do bad. You have no idea what to expect on exams.,0
"he is the only person that can make learning ecosystems fun. great class, excellent lecturer, an easy A as long you take good notes. highly recommended.",1
"He unfortunately creates a hostile learning environment. Rude and condescending. Long emails. No partial credit. Only allows one way of learning, his website, which was built in '98 and its not user friendly at all. You'll spend most of your time trying to figure out his website instead learning the concepts. AVOID AVOID AVOID.",0
He teaches really well. His lectures are amazing and very inspirational. His lab tests are fair but in theory test he will try his level best to fail you. Most of the questions has nothing to do with the topics he covered in the lecture. DO NOT take class with him unless you're really genius or you will fail or barely pass.,0
"This class sucked. Never would I recommend taking her, she gives a lot of assignments and test. She expects a lot out of you. We did 2 chapters a week, plus discussion plus a test. She is not very helpful at all. I would never take her!!!!!!! Plus she takes forever to turn in grades.",0
"grades heavily on attendance, and gives no extra credit, and your final grade is a 12-15 min group presentation. other than that shes a good teacher and lectures are meant to keep your attention",1
"""The.  Freaking.  Man"" indeed.  though Ralph and I have some differences about what makes a great poem (he is a modernist, I am not) he will make you respect modern poetry.  TAKE HIS CLASSES.",1
"If you take this teacher be prepared to work and study hard.  The project is the hardest part of the class make sure you start early.  The tests are also hard even if you study, so be prepared.",0
Andrew is an excellent English professor. His approach to teaching places you in control because he doesn't ask you to search for outside sources. He is interested in what you have to say about the material which can be a transformative experience if you are willing to immerse yourself in the material and his lectures.,1
"She is the best clinical intructor i've had. I had her for med surg 1. She's a tough instructor, but if you put in the effort, you will learn a lot.",1
"class taught me a lot but pretty boring. A LOT OF READING! Take good notes. She's hot and cold, nice sometimes, mean others., participate often and pay attention. Not much help.",0
"DO NOT TAKE CLASS WITH HIM!!  I am a straight ""A student who is struggling to keep my grade up.  He has a 1 week, three assignments rule, original posts must be made within 3 days plus 3 additional on 3 separate days will give you a 79/100 he expects you to go above the ""required"" in order to get a good grade.  I emailed and got a rude response.",0
"Even though he has 40+ years of experience he is the worst teacher I have ever had.  He goes too fast, doesn't care if you get it or not, is demeaning, and DOES NOT know the definition of a teacher.  He is one who thinks just because he gets it everyone should.  I had to practically beg him to explain (teach) me.  I hated going and cried A LOT!",0
"He is very nice, and gives 3 tests, 1 including the final. He gives all the work at the beginning of the semester, and there are 3 papers. He allows you to turn them early and you can get extra credit. The test are really easy if you know the vocabulary, and his class is pretty boring, but if you read the textbook you will be fine",1
"He is a pretty interesting lecturer, and the homework is based entirely on what he says in lecture. Remember his stories, sometimes he will ask questions about a specific story in the homework or even on exams. All the exams are take home though, and make sure to choose a project that is doable rather than crazy hard.",1
"This professor is one of the reasons I left elementary education AND GVSU. In fact, when I look back at GVSU, one of the biggest things I remember is how awful her class was. There was way too much going on! I have felt stress about many college courses, but hers was one of the worst.",0
"Listen to what he says and regurgitate it on papers and mid-terms, or you won't do well. He grades papers harshly in terms of grammar, but content is easy enough if you take good notes. Can be intimidating in OH, but will ultimately help you out. Mid-term and final were fair. A good Prof., but not an easy one. Don't have to do the readings.",1
very interesting class and material. weekly quizzes to make sure you read. no attendance policy but she makes sure your grade gets docked when you arent there by having assignments due when there arent quizzes. she is probably my favorite psych professor ,1
"She is a really nice, tiny woman. I think she teaches well. Very much into class participation.",1
You can go to class every day and still wont understand. You can study and you still wont pass. He will have a class average of a 50% and blame the students. If I was not graduating this semester I would have dropped. He is a terrible professor. Does not care about anything but gives extra credit for going to his Chinese study lecture.,0
"By far the most difficult class I've taken thus far. 100% online due to current circumstances, Zoom says her connection is bad and it's been brought to her attention multiple times, but she refuses to fix it so you cannot understand most of what she says. This class is undoubtedly the most painful I've taken in many years.",0
Well be prepared to bust your ass on three group projects and an unreasonably long packet for such a small portion of your grade.  Not worth taking if you want to maintain a good GPA because its a huge time consumer at the worse times in the semester when you have a ton of other projects and tests.  He should restructure the grading system.,0
"Like another review said, Marek is an overall good person and a good engineer, however he is an absolutely terrible prof. As said, he's a very nice person and will answer your questions if you have them. But that's where the good ends. Pointless lectures, constantly stutters during those lectures, mind-boggling grading criteria and so much more.",0
Girgis's teaching style has completely in changed likely due to how easy the class used to be. I didn't learn anything in the class but struggled to get my grade back up to an A at the end of the semester because she takes off points for no apparent reason. Disregard any comments about the course being an easy A. Only 15/98 students got an A or A+.,0
He is amazing! All of his lectures are entertaining and funny. His math is crazy and there is no reason not to get an A!,1
"The material for EE354 is actually not inherently challenging when compared to earlier EE classes. However, Professor Puvvada's lack of organization and constant emails make it difficult to keep track of what's going on. A lot of points on exams are 'bonus points' if you get every single part right, which means even small mistakes cost you heavily.",0
"Overall decent prof. She really makes you work for a good grade. Some of the concepts I found a little ambivalent. The tests are all essays, on top of the usual essays. The course was very essay-heavy (some are worth 20%). Attendance is not mandatory, but I feel like she judges you for missing or skipping, due to the small class size.",1
"Nice guy, and if you can go in for extra help it's useful.  But godawful teacher with a messed up grading scale.  You either get over 100 on each test or less than 40.  We suspect he tosses the tests down the stairs and which ever goes furthest gets an A.",0
great teacher...made history fun..went to VMI(only mistake),1
"Professor Sicilian means well, but his lectures are all over the place and soooo hard to follow. He gets sidetracked very easily and is the most unorganized professor I have ever had. I ended up doing well in the class because I love econ and am good at it, so don't take him if you aren't either of those.",0
"One of the worst professors Ive taken in my career at GV. Speaks too fast, misspeaks, doesnt explain why hes doing what hes doing, doesnt know how to lecture, repeats himself (not about the course information, though, just filler words. Do you agree? Do you understand?). Hes an expert in the field but does not belong in a classroom.",0
"One of the strictest graders I've ever had.  Marks off often for written answers and usually just explains it by writing ""more detail"" with no explanation as to what she means.  The material itself is not difficult and she makes it easy enough to understand.  But when it comes to grading, she doesn't seem to care if you demonstrate understanding.",0
"Calls himself ""Lib Daddy."" If you dont have an interesting class to go with this professor, the class is terrible. I had a VERY difficult time even going to this class because it felt like such a waste of time. but the assignments are easy, the hardest part are his quizzes at the beginning of the semester, you really need to read/study for those.",0
Dr. Artis is an amazing professor. Her assignments and expectations are clear and she explains the concepts really well. Easily accessible outside of class. She gives a practice midterm and practice final to help you prepare. Weekly homework assignments but they aren't hard. Definitely recommend her for SOC 279.,1
"I love this professor! Hands down one of the best CMB profs at GV. He's very kind, and his lectures are very informative, but all his material is in the lectures. Do NOT skip his class. He's always got a great story to share and has a real enthusiasm for the subject. He makes you want to come back each day even at 8 AM. For 2 hours.",1
Great Guy and super passionate about Geology.,1
"Since this class hasn't been taught in a long time, there's some trial and error to it. There are a large number of readings we're responsible for that we never get to in class. The citation style we use for class is also completely arbitrary as if she made it up, but make sure to follow her instructions clearly or you won't pass with a good grade",0
"She is helpful over email, but it is hard to understand what she says during lecture because the class is so big. You have to buy an online textbook and course notes, about $125 all together. She provides practice problems and sample midterms/finals. This class will occupy a lot of your time but it's not too difficult.",1
The best teacher in the math department !!!,1
not a good professor. not easy to approach at all. he is not easy to talk to. he can be very condescending and is unwilling to put any effort into trying to teach you.,0
"I received actually a B+ in this class but when I went to email her, she never responded or changed my grade. She doesn't really respond with much, only "":)"" in emails.",1
"Extremely difficult and expects alot from her students. Not much help when asking questions. Her mood determines how she would approach her students, and if she did not have a good day, it was placed on her students. Learned some stuff but never felt comfortable around her, felt as if always walking on eggshells.",0
"His class is structured with his own interest in mind rather than students, a series of tricks/gimmicks, seems he is interested in making life more difficult/not expanding knowledge. Changes grading criteria, hides info so that you can only get from his office hours, bizarre test structures which test memory not knowledge, plays favors. Got A tho",0
"This professor is one of the chillest, and really coolest to have, yeah of course there's work but I believe she's one of the best to have. you wont' need to even worry much if you listen to what she has to say. her work is  easy as long as you do them, and its only a challenge if you make it one. she's worth having, oh and her final is open ended.",1
"Great professor, terrible class. Prof-super sweet andvery enthusiastic and knowledgable about Bio. Class-very poorly structured: 1 midterm, 3 500 word essays, weekly online reading/hw, 4 unit quizzes, 1 group project, 1 final, 1 weekly discussion. Ridiculous amount of work and also unclear grading criteria for an intro to bio class for non-majors.",1
"This class is so boring. If you get stuck on a lab, dont bother asking her for help the person next to you is more likely to know what to do. Didnt go to class during lectures, but went for labs. You just get your work done and that's about it. Easy but boring.",0
Extremely helpful woman. Actually asks students what she can do to help them understand more. Taking every MTH class I can with her.,1
a really great professor. he is very helpful outside of class and presents the material in a way that is very easy to understand and learn. he does alot of activities and gives real life examples for the material we are learning. his class is not boring!,1
"He's so full of himself.  His classes are boring, he gives evil glares if anyone so much as blows their nose in class, he's a bad and boring person to listen to.  Makes me want to skip every class just so I don't have to look at his face.",0
"Good professor. Hard grader with both exams and essays, but if you go to Prof. Major for help, you will deff get a good grade, because he tells you exactly what you need to know and what he is looking for to get the best grade possible. Participation and attendance are a must but  the better your attendance and participation the better your grade.",1
"I love this prof. He loves sociology and his students. He loves to joke around in class and makes it interesting. If you had bad time in Pop. Analysis it was you, not him. Always available for help. Very important to read. Exam questions come from the readings. I learned so much in his classes. Fair grader. Believes in students working hard.",1
Brilliant man.  Very nice and funny.,1
"Been in college for five years and he's my favorite professor. Very willing to work with students who are struggling (approachable). Explains grammar concepts in a clear way. Brings outside sources into class lectures, like Arab music artists, poets, etc., so students get a taste of native syntax and culture. A wise, charming, hilarious man. ",1
Jamie is very supportive of her students. She is always willing to meet with students that want extra help. She is extremely knowledgeable and enthusiastic about Canine behavior and understanding and speaking dog. She challenges you  to think out side the box.,1
"Easy Class. His notes are exactly whats going to be on the test. Some of them he doesn't even change the numbers around. Entire Grade is based off 3 test 30 points each. if you just study your notes you will be fine. If your a finance major, your're not going to learn anything, so if you want to learn I would reconsider taking this class",0
She explains things very well but exams are still pretty hard even with lots of studying. Lectures are interesting and Hoyt makes sure everyone is following along.,1
"He has a lot of experience in the field and knows what he's talking about, he's not hard at all and makes it pretty interesting.",1
"Worst professor ever. Encourages discussion on questions and nods yes to basically half of the classes' answers. Come exam, write the same answer - given 0, because it doesn't match marking key. ",0
"worst professor ever. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. All of the assignments are low stakes but because of that she feels like she can give you a 0 on everything. The only ""extra credit"" is if u talk during discussions. I have never hated anything more in my life. She expects a ridiculous amount of work for a 100 level class. Save yourself and do not take",0
"Everything written below is true. She assigns a lot of homework and doesn't collect it half the time. The classes start early and end late. Also, she is very passive aggressive towards students who miss a class.",0
"I took his online Evolution of Hip Hop class. He doesn't show you just how much is due each week, he releases the week's work all on one day exactly 7 days before they're due. One week he assigned 3 quizzes, an hour and a half long documentary with 3 required posts afterwards, and an 8 page research paper all due on the same day. This class is hard",0
I loved Professor Smith's class. All of the work she had us do was extremely beneficial and not just busy work. I always left her class feeling motivated and inspired. She truly cared about all of her students.,1
"Professor Knupfer was a great professor overall. His lectures were fun to listen to, but his papers are tough. You'll have to put in some serious effort if you want to do well. He tries to help anyone he can, and his office hours helped me out greatly. Fantastic professor! Cheers!  -Grant B.",1
"She is a moody and nasty person.  She tells you what changes she wants on a first draft, you make them exactly how she wants them, but she corrects her own changes. She has her favorites and will allow them unfair advantages on other students. You never know what mood you'll catch her in, and your grades are basically prey to her mood of the hour.",0
I love her! She let's you be as creative as you want to be which makes you actually WANT to learn and explore. She applauds almost anything you do creative-wise. She's very open. No tests or quizzes. Just little projects here and there and textbook readings.,1
Attendance was taken in this class for a participation grade worth 10% of the whole grade at the end of the semester. She gives you study guides for each of the 3 exams and tells you what she wants to know. Make sure you TAKE NOTES even though the lectures are dry and skim the book.  The hardest part of the class is a huge court observation paper.,0
"Online class is awful. Very tough grader on papers. Midterm and Final are VERY heavily weighted, you could easily get a 100 on all other tests by simply reading the material, and still bomb the midterm and final, which are worth nearly 50% of your grade. I would NOT take this class online with her, she is absolutely not involved and is no help.",0
She is a fabulous instructor that genuinely cares about her students!!,1
"I heard he's a really kind and funny prof, but in terms of his lecturing, it's horrible. I hated every second of it. The way he talked about certain things were so.... bland. His lecture slides are made to attend class. He doesn't put instructions on how to do certain mechanisms but just use the textbook and you'll do great.",0
the worst prof that you have ever seen in your life,0
"Lectures have attendance taken because you can't learn from anywhere else, and she makes it impossible to learn there. No notes, nothing. Just hope you heard what she said. Heavy and unfair grader, don't expect an even decent mark if she disagrees with your thesis. Also, lecture pop quizzes that spring up out of nowhere, somehow even in seminar.",0
He is very hard to understand.,0
"The labs are horrible. they're supposed to take you a few hours, no they take a few days. The minimal instructions from him and the terribly worded lab manual do not help. The lab final should not be 30 minutes. Overall, the difficulty of labs is insane.",0
"His slides can be a little dense but overall informative. Unfortunately, he can be a little monotone and his lectures are therefore boring.",1
"He means well but he's not the best professor. He tries his best to explain things but does not do so very well. Although he's not the best professor he's very friendly and will try to help you however he can. Very easy grader. If you are looking for an easy A, this is the professor to choose. If you want actually want to learn, choose someone else",1
"I LOVE Kathleen. She is an amazing effects animator who is still very active in the field. Type in her name in IMDB if you're curious. She has a tendency to talk quite a bit, but her lectures and advice are really helpful in the long run. Her figure drawing class is also INCREDIBLE. My favorite class at CSUCI so far.",1
She was very vague with her information.,0
"He moves through class slowly, which can be boring. However it is beneficial, you do develop a strong understanding of the material. He does not give a lot of homework nor the answers to the textbook. Therefore it can be easy to get high 70s too low 80s, but it can be difficult to achieve a higher grade.",1
"Dr. Lane is a great person, and very funny. However, his rubrics are unclear, and he grades extremely harsh. Expect hours of work, for a B grade at best. Go above and beyond the rubric if you want a mediocre grade. The class requires a lot of work, and is not worth it. Take a different honors sequence.",0
Interesting material. 2 easy 1-pg papers make up 20% of grade. Exams are essay format but she basically gives you all the essay topics 2 weeks in advance. Kind of heavy on the reading and a little difficult but still manageable. Extra credit presentation last day of class.,1
"He pretends that he's the nicest kindest most open hearted man ever but in order to get a WORD in to him you have to pester him, yelling, chasing him down the hallway. He talks over you and never lets you speak. He doesn't stay on topic, he pretends he's helpful but he's all talk, no walk. None. If you care about your life, don't take his class.",0
"Interesting material, makes it easy to learn and fun. if you can get past her annoying voice you will love this class!",1
"Had him for 103 and 104. Mans is just not a good professor. He's a nice guy, but you basically teach yourself chemistry. Lots of online homework, test averages stay around 50-60 percent. Get a tutor to teach you the basics, so then you can follow along better. Take advantage of workshop, and if you know you have to take 104, take 103 with wingrave.",0
Couldn't really understand him.,0
I took theater for a GPA booster and at best I will probably get a low B. She lectures daily and her tests are difficult. You also have to see a play that depends on 200 points of your grade.,0
"I took this class online and I have never regretted anything more. The material we were told to study was nowhere near what was on the tests/quizzes. Instead of understanding and being accommodating, she was accusatory, rude, and dismissive! Every week, something went wrong. If this class had been taught by anyone else, it would have been great.",0
"Great teacher.  Really clear expectations, gives you evaluation sheets before every speech so you know exactly what you need to do.  Will always talk to you when you go into her office hours, too.  Really helpful and makes it a fun class.  Highly recommended!",1
"John is teaching students as they are from UofT, he must totally forget that we have a standard textbook. He taught too many things beyond this course. Even though I am really good at assignments, I still got shocked how difficult the quiz was. You need to get full marks by watching his videos, not PDF. In addition, middle-exam is the hell one.",0
"Asks ""YES OR NO?!?!"" after everything. Makes you feel like an idiot for asking any question in front of the class. yesorno yes or no YESORNO!?!?",0
I think that the best way to describe this professor is mediocre. I felt that he was not the best at lecturing and being clear about what we needed to know. He kind of rushes through topics and can be difficult to understand. One AWESOME thing that he does though: index card during test and good test reviews! Also he takes attendance.,0
Loved the experience in class. Just wished for more trans exposure and centered narratives.,1
"Evil woman, spiteful, disorganized. This classroom czar-ess spent most of her time berating the younger students from her 100 level classes and constantly disgressed from an actual lesson by talking about her travels. For a teaching class, the only thing I learned is that you surely don't do it like she does. Avoid her like the plague.",0
"I honestly hope you don't get this professor. She's very unclear with her instructions and will assume you're not ready for this class if you're not a strong writer. She grades very harshly, and won't grade your work if she thinks it looks incomplete. If you get her spend time at the writing center and do what ever you can to be on her good side:)",0
He worte the book (which is HORIBLE)  All he does in class is reads directly from his horrible book.  Blanks out.  Long silent pauses.  Stares out into space.  Not helpfull at all.  His office hours are a waste of time.  The whole class is just memorizing equations out of his horrible book and crunching numbers.,0
"Tomi is one of the best teachers I've ever encountered. Without her I would not have graduated, would not have the job I have now and would still be stuck in Martin working some slacker job. Between classes and The Pacer I learned more from her than 10 oth",1
Taken many of his classes and enjoy his lectures very much. Only warning is you better enjoy reading because there's about a novel a week. Picks very interesting reads though and only two very very easy tests. Have to enjoy reading and discussing novels.,1
"This teacher is William ""Bill"" Cue. DO NOT take this class unless you want to teach yourself and take impossible to pass tests. He only spent maybe 3 days actually teaching and the rest was read your online book and do the quizes. PASS ON THIS TEACHER!!!",0
"Professor Zwier cares so much about his students. If you're having a hard time, he completely gets it. His tests were open note and open internet, etc so it's all about using your resources. He assigns helpful homework, not busywork; his knowledge of chemistry is amazing and he is able to teach things super easily and makes them easy to understand.",1
"Best computer science at the UofA, he sits done but's he's old, what do you expect. He's also hilarious. Projects are easy af, and he's tests are easy.",1
"Probably the worst teacher I've ever had, h when students had issues with submitting test he told us he just wouldn't grade them if they weren't in the right format while only giving us an extra 5 minutes to submit it, he has said to not contact him through brightside and only posts the notes I have not learned anything.",0
"It's an online class, why are tests only available for one day which is a sunday? He wouldn't let me make up a online test. Horrible!",0
He's very clear in his teaching. U will learn so much 4m him if u don't know much about computer. Don't skip class b/c u will learn new material 4 each class & new materials build on old ones (unless u already know it). U only hav 2 read the summary at the end of each chapter 4 the quiz.Very easy,1
Walked out on a presentation to take a phone call,0
"Gupta is a nice guy, but you should avoid ODE at all costs with him if you can. He teaches off of the slides that the texbook publisher made, and when he strays from the slides, he's confusing. He give NO PARTIAL CREDIT on exams at all. There are 7 HWs, a midterm, and a final; if you bomb the midterm and have mediocre HW, he won't help you out.",0
He is an absolutely amazing professor. He knows the material well and is passionate about it. It's pretty easy to do quite well in his class if you just do your work and study for the exams. Plus he is SO HOT.,1
"I absolutely loved having Professor Turkovic for my AMH2010 class. He is lecture heavy, but the lectures are in-depth and require you to think. He gives a clear study guide which are the verbatim questions on his exams. He is a funny and caring professor and I would recommend him to anyone, so long as they are a diligent student.",1
"The most interesting class ever! Lots of videos and slides, a lot of writing. Di Bella presented it so interestingly and passionately. I learnt so much! I never liked history classes before him. TAKE HIM! if you want to learn about history and not just pass through the class with no knowledge. Not too easy class, but he gives a lot of extra credit!",1
"She is so sweet! Very understanding if there is an issue going on and is willing to help work it out. All of the assignments were very easy, especially the tests. I didn't study and got 100s on all of them. Least stressful class of this semester.",1
She is very nice and makes you work hard on project but helps you a lot. Overall she is very good grader.,1
"Worst professor ever met. No class, no video of lecture, he only provide slides with his voice. Tons of error in assignments and finals, and you will lose a lot of marks for his fault.",0
"My time in Professor Kanchi's course can be summed up through one thing she said to me when I asked her a question about the homework: ""Why are you using the lecture notes to answer these? Use the books instead, they give much better information than what we covered in class"".",0
Professor Dattolo not only inspired me to to well in Spanish he inspired me to pursue teaching as a career. He went out of his way to help me and many other students to do our best. He is a true professor in every sense of the word and I highly recommend taking him!,1
No nursing professor in STC is better than the man!,1
"A bit eccentric, but patient with students and explains course material clearly. Great Professor! Material is not hard if you go to class.",1
"Very sweet and kind professor. She put a lot of effort to ensure we understand the materials and she is willing to help you. Basically her lectures are clear (although some trivial mistakes were made during lecture), I would recommend her class. Her GSIs are very helpful and funny.",1
"Dr. Reiter makes you work very hard for your grade. I barely managed to get a C and I worked my butt off to get it. His lectures are very confusing since he rushes thru everything. I wouldn't recommend taking him, but he isn't a terrible option. Very nice guy and will help you when you go to his office. Just not a fan of his teaching style.",1
Knows his subject extremely well.,1
She's a tough grader but she's very helpful.,1
Prof. Cohen was extremely helpful and knowledgable on all topics discussed. The case project was great experience and allowed me to learn the challenging concepts with extreme clarity. By far the best class I've ever taken. I like accounting though!,1
"Grades are based on only two exams, the midterm and the final . Thus, he gives the opportunity of receiving extra credit though participating in class and/or handing in answers to the questions he gives at the end of every class. Lectures are interesting .",1
Definitely my favourite prof. Very clear and answers all questions and is extremely humble and kind. Truly recommended.,1
"The class is easy if you pay attention and go to class. He has no attendance policy but will lecture daily about the importance of going. It's annoying, but he is a good teacher and his tests are easy.  And I'm bad at math, so that's saying something.",1
Profesor Di Bella is awesome. He puts all other professors to shame. Make sure you go to class and take really good notes and if you do that you will be set for the test. He is always excited to come to class and teach us. One of the best teachers you will have during college.,1
"Amazing teacher! Not only was she completely entertaining, she is the sole reason I was able to transfer out of Bakersfield college! Definitely recommend her!",1
Love this man. I took him for Math 124 and he made it really easy to understand. You go through packets every day and he works through each problem. Def take him. I also went to the tutoring center and had a weekly tutor which made the class so much easier.,1
"I was one of the last two taking the final exam, when he walked to his TA and started talking about how easy the test was and how bad everyone was doing. Yes, while students are still taking it... Try concentrating while being made to feel stupid by someone who is suppose to be professional. Long story short I didn't do well and went from C to D.",0
"dan was a nice guy, but was always late, and frequently didn't even show up at all! there where many times when we went to class on wasted train/bart/parking tickets 'cuz he stood us up or was sick. he wasted time by showing internet videos of silly irrelevant to the class videos, and he never used the makeup classes to teach us missed material!",0
"This  was my favorite class. His teaching is very proof-based, so you really understand what is going on behind the math. You will do fine on the tests if you really figure out what is going on in the problem sets. Homework is not mandatory but you should really do it if you want a good grade. Very nice man and he will help you learn calculus!",1
"Rick Brown is a very well-respected teacher. At first, he is one of the most intimidating people, but then he's like a goofy grandpa. He tells it like it is and he does not take any BS. If you want to be in his class and succeed, then you need to take it seriously. You need to make his class a top priority. It is a lot, but he's a big help.",1
"Mike is by far my favorite professor at the University. His methods of teaching are amazing, he is a passionate and engaging professor, and he genuinely cares about his students. Not to mention his intelligence. He is the epitome of scholasticism and coolness. Love this class, I'd take it every semester. It's definitely a life-changing course.",1
"Easiest class I've ever taken. Spends several days going over simple concepts that can be learned in 5 minutes of study. Textbook for the entire lecture can be read in 3 hours and simply reading the textbook is enough to get an easy A+. Confuses himself on concepts and constantly repeats himself, and class is extremely boring.",0
awesome teacher and great person. very willing to help.  doesn't want anyone to fail.  loves what she is doing.,1
"If I'd known of this site before registering & reviews, wouldn't have taken his class & have the regret. Only way to pass is if you tune everything out to hear him clearly since he mumbles & he could explain an essay prompt w/o you realizing it. Only assigns 400 word paper vs the 1,000 criteria. Learned nothing since he genuinely does not teach.",0
He doesn't make any sense. He'll call on you for the most random questions and not tell you what he's looking for. I don't advice anyone to take him.,0
He is a very tough grader. I am a B average student but I could not get higher than a 79% on his exams. He is very unclear with what he wants for his papers. For his exams he wants extra information that was not in the lectures or textbooks.,0
"Her online class isn't even a class. It's terrible. She waits a month to grade essays and when she does, she gives no feedback. How in the world are we suppose to know what mistakes we make, if she doesn't point them out? She's not teaching. She just grades papers late with no feedback. She must enjoy killing our honors gpa.",0
"He didn't give any feedback for papers, and he deliberately gave us a lower mark on the first assignment, only to amend it on the second.  However, he gave me a generous extension when I had no idea how I would have finished my other assignments in time. Additionally, his interdisciplinary approach to scientific content is admirable.",1
She was not clear with her lectures. Skimmed over a lot of the material and was not very thorough.,0
"The lectures were fine to sit through and the readings were interesting (very long and gruelling reads, but still interesting). It just sucks that 70% of your mark comes from tests  tests that were basically purely based off minuscule details from the textbook. If youre not great at tests like me, avoid this course with Brym like the plague.",0
"Most confusing class. Randomly starts speaking Chinese or Japanese. . If you don't know any of those languages and you don't know anything about Chinese or Japanese culture and history already do not take this class. Since its a first year course I thought it would be a bit basic. No, its not. The amount of reading given is insane in online class.",0
"Dr. Herzog is the goat. always hands out pretzels and bonus points. if you do the quiz and show up the next day you get 2.5 bonus points, which really add up. Make sure you do well on your D&P's! If you don't show up for class you will fail.",1
"He is super nice but easily one of the most disorganized professors I've ever had. He posts PowerPoints online but the ones he uses in class are different, making it difficult to follow along. His grammar, punctuation, and organization of the PowerPoints and other documents is not very good and is also hard to understand. I do not recommend taking!",0
"I love Richard! I took him for Advanced Swim and Water Polo. He's a really great guy. He can swim really well. If you love swimming and are halfway decent at it, take his classes. A few online modules, but it's not hard at all.",1
"One of the best professors I have had. You do have 1 presentation of 10 minutes but she is by no means a hard grader. The best part is that she tells you exactly what powerpoints to study for the 3 exams you have and better yet the final is a cumulative of the 3 exams, its a given to pass. Also allows for make up work and labs to be done in groups.",1
Dr. Shine is an excellent example of what all college-level professors should strive to become.,1
"worst teacher ever, all the bad comments in here are all true. Tough grader, no consideration what so ever, no extra credit even if you beg for it, and if you miss something she won't let you retake it. I would say taking this teacher as a last resort but honestly don't take her at all. she loves to shove the syllabus in your face.",0
"Worst english professor I have ever taken. Never goes over her expectations in the course, or what she is looking for. Weird deadlines, and just unrealistic expectations. Then at the end there is a wonderful essay during your final that she never even brings up. Don't worry about it though, it's not like it's your entire final grade or anything.",0
"His lectures are great and you can just tell he is passionate about the readings he assigns. He takes time to type out notes on the readings and sends it out to the class. He is very accessible over email. He isn't a tough grader if you listen to the lectures and look over his notes. However, do not take if you are not interested in the subject.",1
Below average teacher,0
"Professor Camara is a nice guy, but the class is not well laid out. You don't learn a lot if you have taken previous French, but he is very helpful. It was neat to have a native French speaker, but sometimes I think things were lost in translation.",0
He is a nice person who is helpful. Open Notes/Book and only takes attendance for labs. The class is a breeze if you have any programming knowledge at all. If you don't then just read the book.,1
"Dave is my favorite part of the day in the comm. department.  always there to listen, and offers the best advice.  great teacher who always is willing to help out any student at any time!  way to go Dave-- you should have the POTY award!",1
"Smart lady but really is not a good lecturer. Takes forever to make a point and has an annoying voice. The class has its moments, but hers are rare.",0
"Took her MATLAB course. It had a good balance of quizzes and homework, with the final project being the most daunting part of the whole class (but turned out not being as scary as I thought). Reading the textbook helps when you get confused. She's very willing to help and explains things well, and is available outside of class. Overall, good!",1
"Loved her in all the comm. classes that i've taken with her. Her tests are fairly easy, and she allows you to bring a ""cheat sheet"" to every one. Also, classes are interesting, and never boring. Definitely a class I recommend.",1
"Inaccessible outside of class - left everything to TAs. Very disorganized, and left all communication to last minute. Health Behaviour Report, 3 exams & 12 quizzes. Exams & quizzes on Connect ($$$), 49-50 sec/question on exams. Behaviour Report was tracking and changing behaviour for 2 weeks and applying concepts learned in first half. Frustrating.",0
"The lectures are hard to follow and jump back and forth between topics, so taking notes is difficult. Some of his test questions are worded in a confusing way, but if you explain how you interpreted them he'll usually give you credit. The paper was never explained and a rubric was never posted. Overall, a good professor but confusing.",1
"If you try and watch her lectures it is clear that she doesn't have much of an idea of what shes talking about. She doesnt give feedback on the assignments so you never know why you got a bad grade, and she also doesnt explain what shes looking for on said assignments. She doesnt care about what youre going through, she is strict and to the letter.",0
He's an interesting prof. His lectures are basically arguments that he's trying to prove. I find he's somewhat of a difficult marker but he gives an outline of what he specifically wants so as long as you follow that you should be fine! Great and interesting class!,1
"Totally sucks. Teaches out of date material, waster of my money",0
"This class was extremely frustrating due to the vague instruction given to us on assignments. He will stand up front and read PowerPoints, and then assign projects and homework that he has not explained. If you try to E-mail him for help, he will respond with something like, ""Try again"", or ""Read prompt again for it to make sense"".  Very unhelpful.",0
"He is nice, but doesn't teach. When you go to office hours he has an attitude when students ask questions. Makes incredibly hard exams ""based on the book"" but avgs were F's and no hw or ec is given. Take somebody who gives more work so you can save ur grade from exams. If you can teach yourself orgo during covid take him i guess.",0
"This is the easiest teacher you'll ever have.  If you want to learn, I'd advise against taking her.  If you want an easy A, go for it.  Don't buy the book, you can use any Intro to Psych book. Class is never actually 3 hours, more like 1 1/2 - 2. Gives extra credit. I like to learn, but took this class because I already knew most of the material.",1
"Gives the most work out of any history professor.... at least 100 pages of reading before each class.. about 6 papers, but not too long in length.  Good teacher but a tonnnn of work.",1
I took her 8am psych sport class. SOOO BORING. You have to go to class and do the clicker quizzes that she does just about all the time. Her exams are a bit tricky so you have to read the chapters and study her power points to do well. Not much work outside of the exams though.,1
"I highly recommend Professor Chen. I took this class online during the summer. It is 6 one to two page papers on a prompt he gives each week, a midterm, and a final. For the midterm/final he gives a review guide and you can use that on the exam. He posts a video each week which goes over the reading. He offers office hours if you need help.",1
"Kinda hard, you've gotta read the book.  Lectures are funny, but the tests are tricky.  At least he grades on a curve and most of the essays are extra credit.  Grading is kinda weird though.  He's a funny guy and if you need to talk to him he is easy to access.  He expects everyone to be ""young psychopathologists"" though. I'd probably take him over",1
"He is the sweetest man you will ever meet! I really cannot emphasize how nice this man is.  He is clear in his lectures and is always ready to help his students.  His assignments are not difficult, mainly because he is so clear with everything.  I definitely recommend him.",1
"This prof is very vague when it comes to explaining things to her students. She will also spend too much time covering basics (things such as periods going at the end of sentences). Work load is not bad, but she does not round grades. Understandable if you have an 89.45%, but unreasonable when you finish with an 89.99% (I speak from experience).",0
"Ann Mantell is a very sweet lady! The reason I got a C was completely on me, I skipped class every time unless there was a test. Although if she made attendance mandatory I would have been more motivated to show up. Overall, if you take this professor just dont skip class cause it will be extremely hard to learn the material on your own.",1
"Pete was hilarious, until it came to the tests. Then he was pretty mean. They were RIDICULOUSLY HARD!!! And only half of the test material was covered in class.",1
A lot of snoozy discussions and nap time.,0
"Good professor, but the class was really basic and low-level. Probably a great class for non-anthro majors who want to fulfill a social science requirement; not that great for those with a more comprehensive understanding/interest in cultural anthropology, even as a freshman. A good overview course, though, I guess.",1
"No homework, but the test are a little tricky. Test are mostly from Slides, you probably don't need to buy the book.",1
"Prof Allison is my fav professor I have had at UD so far. He is structured, straight to the point, and very organized. You can tell he is incredibly passionate about his job and all the work he has done in the field of special ed. His intelligence on the subject is visible through his lecture presentations. 3 papers, 3 exams",1
"Prof. Class is a very sweet lady, but her class for french 1 was extrememly difficult. It was fast paced and the exams were BRUTAL. We were treated like french majors despite not having any french exp. The textbook was $125 & nonrefundable so i couldn't afford to drop. Plus no extra credit. Hardest class i've taken, only take if u know some french",0
She's a sweet lady but just a little bit out there. Her part of the class was pretty easy. Tests come exactly from her slide worksheets.,1
"Dr. Saku isn't a terribly intelligent man, in general. His class is mediocre in content and his delivery is far from inspiring. The class relies heavily on three 100-point tests so you must attend class to get the lecture notes.",1
"She really cares about her students and has a very open lecture and takes any questions that people have and do her best to answer them. Her tests are tough but you get a two sided cheat sheet for each test and can use them all on the final. Her lectures can kind of be all over the place, has no power point slides and hard to follow at times.",1
"Everyone was forced to take this class my semester and I think it was most disliked class of the year. He was an average teacher, he wasn't always super clear with information and how he was grading though which was frustrating at times. The tests were all based off the textbook and we never had lectures so you have to read everything on your own.",0
"If you ask him too much he gets mad. Due to pandemic, I have to spend the night and I am not in the best condition, but trying to get all the detailed information within short period is just annoying. He doesn't give you good grade unless it is near perfection. He seems to be intellectual, but I don't like him.",0
"Okay so Professor McClymer is super nice but he has one of the most boring lectures. Every single class you have an online homework due and then you go over it in class and listen to him lecture. No matter how hard you try to pay attention, you can't. He never takes attendance and you never know your grade in the class.",0
"Dr. Overby was my favorite professor! I love his sense of humor and his molecule and joke of the week. His tests are a little challenging, but if you study what he tells you to, you'll do fine.",1
Awesome Guy!,1
"He is a terrible professor. I would not recommend if youre looking to get a decent grade. I am an A/B student and ended with below a C. When I went to get helpful tips on how to improve, he told me to review my essay from the beginning of the semester on study tips. He is very passive aggressive and demeaning. Does not have students best interest.",0
"Professor Henderson is the best teacher anyone can ever have, her class is not hard if you listen to all her lectures, do your work and ask questions when help is needed, she has a very kind heart and she's very understanding.",1
Don't take this dude if you can - all he does is read off PDFs and then expects great results out of students. PDF of the book is available online so you don't have to buy it. Good luck,0
"THE WORST CLASS I HAVE EVER TAKEN, ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. DO NOT TAKE IT. Exams and quizzes are based on text book, (AND THE WRONG ONE, TOO), BORING, and he doesn't help WHATSOEVER. I knew everything in the class prior to this course, and I cannot even believe how terrible the experience was. HORRIBLE. He takes too long to respond too. STAY AWAY",0
Only 5 days of class mandatory to attend. Very simple assignments worth 40% such as a 2-3 min Research Project Report on a controversial topic and a Cultural Plunge to get you to feel different cultures. The other 50% of the class is making sure you have good remarks on your Teacher Evaluations. Much less work than ED-201,1
"Dr. Ratwik is an awesome teacher!!! She's harder then hell, but you learn a ton.",1
"If you go to class, you are going to do fine. A lot goes on in class with lectures, discussion topics, and group work. She's experienced and thoughtful with her answers to our questions. I want to take another class of her's again.",1
"What a great man. Truly cares about his students and what he's teaching. Always available to help you and wants to see you succeed. I've run into him several times at the gym and he's extremely friendly. Material is boring, but he is funny nevertheless. Go to him for help with problems! I'd reccommend him.",1
"Obscure things he does: tells us that the quiz will not have any interpretive question yet makes an all interpretive short answer quiz with a 15 minute limit, never supports his claims, make obscure metaphors (he slaughtered Beowulf), talks in low voice on important parts, has an attitude when u ask him a question, admits he can't answer his own ?s",0
"He's an excellent educator and mentor. He clearly knows what he's talking about and he's passionate about it too, so it's hard to get bored or lose interest. He'll keep you busy but he's very empathetic towards college students and extremely approachable if you need anything. As long as you put forth an effort to do the work, you'll be fine.",1
Terrible prof. Brutal at responding to the student. Marks and feedback are unreasonably long to hear back. Midterms and exams are very hard. Terrible to have if your not a finance genius.,0
"I thought this class was going to be easy because I read the reviews and I needed a breath requirement filled. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. His lectures are so boring and his accent puts you to sleep. If you have absolutely no interest in the changes France underwent during the twentieth century, I seriously advise you to choose a different elective.",0
I am nearly done with my psych degree and had great professors who base classes on scientific evidence; I am probably more knowledgeable than previous reviewers. Pretty much everything Sarver taught (in my brief time before dropping) was scientifically inaccurate. Some wrong info would be harmful if believed by future clinical practitioners. AVOID.,0
"Dr. Lee made even the most difficult of concepts crystal clear by incorporating analogies into it. The midterm was fair, but make sure you read the question carefully and know exactly what it is asking.",1
"Completely all over the place, she doesn't even know what's going on. Super boring but SO easy, you could hand in a paper 3 weeks late and she probably wouldn't even notice. Doesn't really make lesson plans, you just hang out til the class is over. Attendance doesn't matter. If you want to actually learn, take someone else. ",0
"He talks about himself a lot, & his organizations. Seems ignorant and didn't spend much time teaching.",0
"Show up to class, He will literally tell you whats on the tests/quizzes so take notes, lectures are actually pretty good as well",1
"this guy is terrible holy wow I actually couldn't believe it. I wish I read these reviews before I took a class with him. He literally rambles about nonsense in his lectures and looks at this nonsense straight from the syllabus ""You must allow yourself 10-15 hours each week if you are going to succeed."" for a 3 credit online course.....",0
"This course is very exam heavy. 85% of the total grade is composed of 4 exams(including final). However, he goes over in the lectures every type of problem you may see and emphasizes the content you must know. Because of this the exams are not very challenging: I got 100's on two of them. This was the best professor I have ever had.",1
"This form demonstrated the level of frustration of this class perfectly. Is she a professor I like and would like to be friends with? Of course. Would I take this course again? NO. Prof Arnold is a great person, but she isn't very helpful, I felt punished for trying my hardest. It seems like every time I turn around i was senselessly docked points",0
"This was the hardest class i have had so far in CBE. If you do not have old tests, you will not pass. The old tests have EXACTLY the same questions as the tests he gives you. I found this out halfway through the semester so my test scores went from a 30 to a 80. HW can easily take 10 hours per assignmt even w help. HW is EXACT same every year.",0
"This professor knows a lot. If you seek help, he will help you enormously and will give you knowledge beyond what the class has to offer. I found him to be a very kind person as well. Would definitely take another course with him.",1
"Excellent topics to learn...interesting subject matter. However, the field trips are were completely ridiculous! The guys expects everyone to be an expert climber and hiker...the guy needs to get a clue, because not everyone has the same capabilities as he does and does not have the familarity and experience of the terrain like he is used to.",1
"Definitely take Chung! She's awesome! I've never learned so much in a class before. The info is really interesting. Gives amazing study guides that are pretty much exactly the same as the tests. 3 midterms and 1 final. Drops the lowest midterm. 4 HW assignments (super easy). No group projects, no quizzes, no papers. She dresses really well, too!",1
"Extremely specific criteria for assignments that she changes constantly, often exactly the opposite. Leaves many students confused at their grade dropping after we did exactly what she said to do. Likes to ask questions in class and then berate students for guessing, has such a specific answer in her head at all times that nobody knows.",0
"She assigns a ton of work. She is a nice person, but the comments that she leaves on your papers are pretty rude. She can come off as condensing.  There are so many papers and they must be incredibly detailed. She is a ridiculously hard grader. Like she grades you on participation (only professor I know that does that)  I suggest avoiding her.",0
As a strong a student who struggled to hold a c in this class I would not advise taking sydney brown. she is very unapproachable and seams to not show up to class every other week or so. She tends to act superior and speaks to her students as if they are unintelligent.,0
"He is one of the best math teachers Ive had. He goes out his way to make sure you understand whats going on. Hes a very brilliant professor. Hell even bring in snacks to class. Like cupcakes before spring break! If you have to take stats, I highly recommend him. He returns emails pretty quickly as well.",1
"Good professor, fair marker. Sometimes off-topic but eventually gets back to the point.",1
"Prof was terribly boring during lecture.  Work given to do was absolutly way too much.  Examples given in class were the easiest ones he could find.  Terrible organized.  Class is required for engineering.  Way to go MSU, not like your hurting for money.",0
"assigns readings on the material but wants you to basically repeat his own beliefs that he had during class discussion, which is just him talking at you and then asking if you have any problems with what he said. you can do alllllll the readings but if you dont ride on his beliefs, youll fail. weird for a philosophy class.",0
"Rider is one of the most knowledgable profs at marist. If you study int'l biz, shes a must take for her wealth of knowledge. If you participate and are engaged, she will like you. Work can get tough at times- read the handouts and review and you'll do really well. Good luck on your tri-fold and country paper.",1
"help me. no one has any idea what is going on, he rushes through chapters and when they test comes no one knows what's going on. this class is a nightmare, he is also really boring, monotone and plain rude. don't do this to yourself.",0
"As a person- always helpful, gives a lot of feedback, always flexible and willing to help. As a proff.- she is often scattered and busy and rarely gives papers back, willing to accomadate though. Overall, not a bad teacher if you need the credit- I do suggest her.",1
"BY FAR ONE OF THE BEST, REALLY CARES, FAIR, ABOVE BOARD WITH ALL HE DOES, ONLINE CLASS AND WAS GREAT,,,, GROUP PROJECT IS GREAT BUT LAZY STUDENTS DO NOT HELP BUT ARE DEALT WITH,,,,,TEST HARD BUT ARE DOABLE.....A MUST TAKE CLASS OR CLASSES WIHT PROF. CARR",1
"This Larry David look-a-like is simply another professor who couldnt hack it in the real word and hides in academia. He couldnt cut it as a lawyer so now he stands in front of college students and tries to intimidate them with his ""brilliance"" by making references to obscure legal terminology. I didnt read a thing and laughed my way to an A-",0
"She gives problems on tests that arent in her review. Only hints that there might be problems from sections earlier in the quarter so make sure you study, but isnt specific even when you ask her. Its as if she doesnt want to see her students do well. Dont take her.",0
He's clearly super passionate about the topic but the lectures are pretty brutal to sit through. Some of the material is interesting but he makes his tests WAY too hard for a 200 level class. Absolutely do not take it with him if you have a busy semester because test-prep is time consuming,1
"Definitely an easy class, but definitely not an easy A. I really worked for the grade I got, but I generally like her. You have to go to class though, especially if you don't understand the material. She does want you to succeed though and take advantage of her office hours cause she's the most helpful then.",1
"I was a TA.  I was a student.  He is a smart professor and a smart businessman.  A treasure to the University, you are lucky to chat with him.  He has insight that other profs will not give you.  cheers!",1
"Great guy, dean of the school. Class is kinda easy, you just have to pay attention and study your notes before a test, theres only 3 tests. Most work is online, you can do the online work without reading but i suggest you read it to do better on tests. he brings donuts, great guy to get to know here, cares about students. lets you out early a lot.",1
"Try to take any other professor... The first few weeks I only used class notes and found his teaching method to be really confusing. After performing poorly on the first test I started to use the textbook to study, that saved my grade. If you have to take him, just use this textbook. Only 9% of the class made an A, compared to 30% w other profs.",0
Just simply a great communicator and teaches well and makes it fun to learn,1
"She may be my favorite professor. She is always excited about the subject, and talks and tells stories as if she had been there. It makes everything memorable, and art history is far from boring in her hands. Exams are predictable; once you know how to study for them, they're not bad at all. I wouldn't take art history with anyone else!",1
"Nice guy, and truely is a good teacher, but his class is H-A-R-D. I would not reccommend taking him. You have to read the book, do the book problems, always go to class, and the homework is VERY difficult and is graded for accuracy.",1
"The papers are hardest thing. He tears apart any paper you take to him & you end up struggling to finish at the end because you've rewritten it three times. Any other prof would have graded my papers higher. Felt like he wanted master's thesis for last 3 papers, and @ end of the semester, not possible. Way too hard for a 200 level class.",0
So long as your opinion is exactly the same as his you will do wonderful in this class. However if you have your own thoughts on something youd better keep them to yourself or risk failing.,0
The best prof I ever met.,1
"One of the worst profs I've ever had. She doesn't look at the students when she lectures or acknowledge your existence. Seems like she's reading off her slides but all she says about the artworks is that they are ""important"" because they ""changed things."" Pointless. The TA marked everything and I did really well in the course but she was awful.",0
"Very interesting class. Although Mr. Balch does like to brag a lot, he has very interesting stories related to the field. Tests are easy and homework is not graded.",1
"I really like Prof. Lyons. The course was really hard due to the massive amount of material to get through, but she's knowledgeable and passionate about the topics, and if you take the time to come to class and read the text book, it's very informative. I'll take another class from her for sure.",1
"She has difficulty speaking English and understanding complicated sentences in English, even though she is an English professor. She would be more appropriate in another department, such as global economics or history. She is often rude. She doesn't seem to like Americans very much.",0
Professor Forrest's ALEKS based course was wonderful! I have struggled with math for years and Mrs. Forrest helped make math manageable and enjoyable.,1
"Four meetings with him to discuss your writing and a portfolio at the end of the semester -- that's all you really need to do well in Poetry Writing. Show an interest and he'll help you in any way he can. He tries to be nonbiased, but you'll have to write how he sees fit. Lots of group focus/sharing and response. Touchy feely. A little boring.",1
"She's a great professor. Grade relies heavily on participation in class. Some online reading modules required, but you have all semester to do them. One individual essay, one group project that takes up a good portion of the semester, and a group essay for that project. She gives individual grades so don't worry if your partner isn't great.",1
best teacher so far!,1
"Very strict with students, but does not help you.  Leaves you hanging in online classes.  Does not grade, correct, answer or help in any way with your education.",0
"Found her classes difficult. After taking a few with her I'm finally self-defeated and will avoid in the future. VERY discussion heavy. Worth 30% of the grade, and you have to post a minimum of three substantial posts weekly. A tough grader as well.",0
"Math113, or stat,  is supposed to be the easiest math class provided at this school, but it is the opposite. I took stat in high school and it does not correlate in the slightest. The professor has an extremely heavy accent and teaches very quickly. Does not understand students questions nor does he really understand the curriculum himself.",0
It was an easy class but I won't take much away from it. He gives a sample of the tests so if you know that stuff you're pretty set. Don't buy the textbook you don't need it at all. Attendance is not necessary if you can get the notes from someone else,1
"Half of the assignments were graded by his TA and half by him so grading was all over the place. Lecture slides were full of text, multiple paragraphs per slide, went super fast, and nothing was put online so good luck getting any of the info. The biggest portion of your grade is a massive, quarter long group project, so hope you like that.",0
She's the reason I'm not a geology concentrator. Incredibly disrespectful and discouraging.,0
"Dry teaching, takes herself way too seriously. and just an all around unkind person. The only William & Mary professor I truly dislike. When I was struggling w/ depression over sexual assault and not doing my best work, she was cruel, unprofessional, and had no leniency. Clearly does not care about her students mental health or wellbeing at all.",0
"Schreibfeder is the easiest teacher ever. No final or midterm. All quizzes are take home. He calls out answers as you guys grade, so just get an extra sheet and copy all the right answers and turn that one in. Only thing is the 9 page paper he gives nearly the whole semester to do. Majority of class did it last minute and still did well. Cant fail",1
"You are not going to learn programming in his class. He only taught few algorithms but didn't do any coding in the class. Also, he only calls out girls names in class and make them solve the algorithms on board. He is unprofessional and his jokes are sometimes inappropriate. It's an easy A if you help him in his personal life problems.",0
Professor Wider is a great professor. He's very easy going and understanding. His tests and quizzes are very easy if you do the readings assigned. Would definitely recommend him!,1
"He was incredibly boring, very monotone. the textbook for this class was also boring. he's kind of condescending too. howevr, he assigned very few small assignments, at least for this class, practically our entire grade was tests and our final paper. i fell asleep most of the time.",0
"Through all of her quirkiness, Laurel actually proves to be a great professor. If you study, you will get a good grade. The class is cut up in 4 sections, a test for each, along with spontaneous pop quizzes. The quizzes add up so make sure to do the readings. Overall, two thumbs up!",1
This class is going to be hard in general so if you are going to take it take dr purser! He is a great teacher!! Very relaxed and funny. He is definitely interested in what he teaches and takes it very seriously. He does not rush through lectures and makes sure you understand the material. I would definitely take him again!,1
"Mrs Brown is a really great and nice teacher, and she gives a lot of extra credit. The lecture in her class some kind of bored but lab part was fun. Otherwise, If you not understand, she will help you.",1
Excellent professor!! Easy class and fun class he makes it interesting so that you pay attention. I would recommend it 100% ??,1
"If you are not prepared to work, do not take this class. She is a fair professor and will try to give you as many points as she can but you have to put in the work to earn your grade.",1
"I appreciate how he would always says ""I used to be like you guys, I was a student too"", it reduce the distance between students and him. Very clear lectures, he goes back and forth to explain without getting impatient. His tests are not too bad, decent, but do study and be careful.",1
"He cares about students, great guy",1
"This professor is very knowledgeable and if you are taking the Supply Chain and Operations program he will be by far the most valuable in terms of take home knowledge. He is however rather unapproachable and with his high degree of knowledge comes a high degree of arrogance. His classes are very educational, but they are not pleasant due to him.",0
"A lot of homework, class isnt very interesting , shes not open or friendly but very critical and a tough grader, she cares about improving your writing skills but not about helping your grade or anything else personal. I would not recommend her at all, she takes her job way too seriously.",0
Awful class Worse class I have ever taken.  She will not review tests answer questions or give examples.  doesn't appear to value students at all When we pointed out incorrect test answers she refused to give us credit for them,0
"Dreadful instructor! Completely unprepared, gives As pretty much to all as to compensate for her inability to teach. Shows up late, returns assignments way late. She acts nice in view of teaching evaluations: an insult to our intelligence. One of the worst classes at UBC!",0
"I am in in her Biology 120 lab. This professor is unreliable and uncommunicative. She also does not answer your question when you email her, and if she does its 2 word answers. I would not take her class if possible.",0
"This class is NOT hard, you have to put effort into it. For the most part the professor lets you know what is expected, you just have to read the syllabus. If taking this class online, make sure u read the syllabus and turn things in on time and you'll be fine.",1
Bettina is the best! She is very relatable and never draws out a lecture. Instead she combines personal anecdotes and historical context to make very interesting lectures! I now have a more complete understanding of what intersectionality is and how strongly it relates to feminist issues. You will be lucky to have Bettina as a professor!,1
"Very nice man.  Rather borring, good 9 am nap class before chapel.  Tests are really long but the questions are fair.  What you see is what you get.  Recommended",1
He's just okay. Boring lecturer doesn't really bring anything new to the table. i learned nothing.,0
Teaches well and you can learn a lot from his class.....but his exams are really hard and confusing and no matter how hard tyou study ....you can get a bad grade....,1
WOW,0
"Weekly h/w: discussion board, 2 replies, journal entry, reading quiz, review quiz. 1 research paper, 1 case study, 4 other papers, 1-2 pages. 2 exams & 1 final. I missed over 10 weeks and he let me make up all the work I missed, including 1 exam. I didnt do the research or case study papers, and still got an A! Very understanding and caring.",1
Didnt buy textbook. Attend all lectures take good notes and youll be fine. She gives essay exams but tells you the six questions a week before so you can prepare. go to her office hours that week and shell tell you what to include in each answer. Also has extra credit essays,1
Was a tough grader but makes an effort to help you as long as you make the effort as well. Simple as a i can put it.... just do your work!! Like i said if you just try she will try and work with you just dont be lazy.,1
"Such a passionate guy! He makes his lectures interesting and inspires students to love the topics. It's best to show up for class since his powerpoints consist of a lot photos and few words, however he does post podcasts on LEARN. He's definitely made me interested in planning. A++++",1
Shes rude. She teaches us stuff in which The class doesnt believe will benefit us. She also tried to get loud with a student because He didnt have his flash drive. Like idk what type of teacher treats there student in such a rude way. Its unacceptable.,0
The course work is has to be the literal terms on the textbook instead of memorization. She doesn't use canvas and her grading that you've tried to do what the instructor said not being fair graded. Don't take her class if you're looking for help in literature when your not a literature person!,0
"I really enjoyed this class. He is extremely knowledgeable about philosophy. Your grade is 50% midterm/50% final. Homework is optional, but help lectures make more sense, and he goes over the answers everyday. Both exams are a majority homework questions. I did the homework, participated everyday, got A's on the exams. Easiest class I took.",1
"Dr. Schellhorn is by far he worst professor I've ever had. She says on day 1 that the final exam is going to be incredibly difficult and every semester the average is an F. She also says that she won't curve the course at the end, but not each individual exam. She only curves by 9 points but says that she will curve by a lot more than than.",0
"He's all business. Slow lecturer, will draw on and on about 1 point, and it's often not very important. He knows his stuff, though, nothing from the book, it seems to be all from memory. There's basically no homework and the only assignments are tests and quizzes, and he gives you a study guide (key words) but the questions are vague, at best.",0
"her class is solely based off 5 HW's and 3 tests, that is it. You are going to have to be detail oriented. She is particular about the papers, she lets you submit papers early for review and she gives good feedback.  I started doing that the class became a breeze. also don't buy the book all I needed was notes didn't open the book once I got an A",1
"Professor was very well knowledgeable in the material. Because of that, he has trouble explaining things in a way struggling students can understand. Also would always say he would release or grade stuff then never did on time. Ended up having students self grade themselves and do a big assignment randomly in the last 2 weeks of the semester.",0
"God he is the best prof at Dal, he'll even tell you himself. This class is made amazing by him as my last philosophy professor completely ruined my view on philosophy, but Macintosh revived it. If you can, def take a course by him. He's so funny, and he'll make sure your ideas are heard. This is one of those classes where anything said isn't wrong",1
"At first I was not a fan of Ted Bishop, but now looking back he was actually a pretty solid professor. We only handed in a paper and then a revised version of that paper so it was not a writing heavy course. He assigned a decent amount of reading but I only did some of it and got along just fine. He is very picky with marking though.",1
"Barry Cooper is the least considerate person I know. He cares very little about his students and abuses the fact he has tenure. What a terrible prof, and an inconsiderate human.",0
Best prof out of the three that lectured.  Great lecturer and very clear about the exams and material covered.  His exam is tricky though as he wants exact wording or it may be incorrect.,1
"Of all the classes I took online, sociology was my favorite! I am a pre-med major and this course gives you an insight into the different problems we face as a society, but this professor made the weekly discussions meaningful instead of having you repeat the information from the textbook. Highly recommend she is a very nice lady!",1
If this is the one professor to take she is the one! She gives amazing lectures and is supportive of whatever you need. Shes always there to help and explains things thoroughly. Her grading is a bit slow but she also teaches a lot of different departments. I highly suggest her!!!,1
Dr. Gervasi is a hard professor but he is the only one who teaches Calculus at Porterville College. His exams are so hard but he gives partial points which helps sometimes but not all the time. He gives like 6 exams and more than 10 quizzes just in the period of one semester. He doesn't have any office hours. Dont take him unless you have no choice,0
"started MAT-106 and was excited  bc of his high rating. However, if you are not great at algebra, he won't slow down for you.  I was completely lost. 1st class  was told I need to get up to speed. 2nd class was told he does not teach algebra in this class and I have to already know it.  I had to drop , I was lost after only 2 classes",0
"If you TRULY care about learning and becoming better in coding, take her.",1
He does not grade easy. Expects you to know everything without him teaching anything. If you take this class be prepared to read the books and get all the information you can on anything he talks about.,0
"I hated hearing her lectures. She would give us a basic statement and say ""go ahead and discuss this with a partner for 5 minutes"". It was honestly a massive waist of time, since none of us even talked about the topic, as it was just a basic statement. She also would play Youtube videos that were probably made by a middle schooler. Terrible videos.",0
l i t e r a l l y the only professor that made my Academy experience even somewhat tolerable. She is such a beautiful and wonderful woman and I almost bought her a sweater with a pug on it because I love her so much. She is God's gift to mankind.,1
"Really bad prof.  I will admit that he is a nice man,which I believe is the main reason people think he is so amazing.  Put aside his nice personality, and you have a terrible professor.  His classes are boring, useless, and much harder than they should be(since they are technically the bird courses in business).  Avoid Neil",0
I didn't enjoy this class. He was very arrogant and required that we read chapters 3 or 4 times to understand material. But he didn't teach out of on e specific chapter at a time. I wouldn't recommend him.,0
"Like Professor Ryan, except the other way around, and not interesting.",0
"Made a boring 6-9pm class very very enjoyable. Other people complain about his ""philosophical rants"" but it invites me to think more about the matter hes presenting us in a deeper way. He made me truly interested in psychology!! Great prof (:",1
Dr. Dillard is by far the worst professor I had at UAH.  While I got an A in the class it was only because I learned to spit her opinions back to her on the exams.  Her deragotory statements toward students were offensive.,0
"avoid this lab instructor...She has a serial killer look to her. Very hard marker and I know this because I took my work to the other two lab instructors and they both agree the mark should be higher. Maybe she means well but honestly, it is stupid the deductions she give...just avoid, go to Melissa's section",0
She made me mad that my previous professors have been so confusing! So sweet and kind just an all around great person! She went out of her way to help a student who almost fainted in class by taking them home to make sure they were safe. SHE MAKES MATH EASY!,1
"This was possible the most boring class I have ever taken in my life. He almost always reads directly off the slides and for being a ""safety expert"", this guy has been involved in more workplace accidents than anyone I know! And as far as grading, when it comes to the group project he varies from group to group. Terrible teacher",0
Every review on this is basically a lie. It is 2 months into the semester and not even the final withdraw date yet and 1/4 of my class is gone. If you cannot teach yourself stay away. If you go to him for help he will get annoyed if you don't understand the material. Always cancels office hours. More than half my class is failing with like a 50 avg,0
"Anybody who takes her class will love her. She is very funny and caring. She is not a hard grader, and you can expect at least a B if you turn everything in on time. I highly recommend her, she is the best COMP teacher at Kutztown.",1
"Intelligent and cares about the subject matter, but dull and not very class-aware--doesn't give the students enough time to take notes on his slides. He also made a comment about Africa creating more waste than the USA because it's 'underdeveloped', a fact that is both false and ignorant.",0
"Dr. Fischer is a very nice professor. He's very monotone and the seminar tends to drag, but the topics we read about were very interesting. He's kind and approachable, so don't be afraid to ask him if you get stuck. Only one paper due at the end, don't procrastinate.",1
"She doesnt respond to any emails, takes forever to grade, and doesnt consider that were in a PANDEMIC. Her grading was tough and she wasnt lenient at all. Take it at another school dont put yourself through the stress and mental deterioration. Disappointed because I had heard so many good things about her when classes were in person.",0
She rambles...A LOT and is very hard to understand. She also likes to repeat things. I barely went to class and still got a B,0
"She is definitely on the crazy side.  There are no written tests besides the final. Instead, you do probably 7 speeches at least starting the second week.  Her way of giving speeches sounds mechanical and bad, but its the best way to get an A.  She gives plenty of extra credit opportunities, RTTP is interesting, but she loves what she does.",1
Good Teacher,1
"Awesome sweater vests, amazingly interesting lectures, best sense of humor, sexy indian lips, gives you all answers if your nice geologist.",1
"What I liked most is the integration of cultural stories and personal experience that you cannot find in any textbook, that helped look at issues from a very, very different perspective. The only criticism is that this course covers too much. But I would recommend it to anyone interested in Islamic and Middle East studies.",1
"She is an inspirational women. She teaches her student to make the connection textbook to real life. She will not teach you she will help you make the connection. 80% is individual learning. Those comments below are from people who are lazy , expect everything to be handed down to them, and dont read before class.",1
Dr. Corson is absolutely awesome. He loves the subject and his humor makes it even better. Pay attention and the class is an interesting one.,1
She is honestly the most passive aggressive teacher I've ever met. She is very salty about people not going to class and she will send you A LOT of emails. You have to take notes on EVERYTHING she says and not organized. homework and assignments are pointless lectures are boring. starts class early ends class late. she killed my love for french,0
"Matchett obviously knows his material, but in class I found the way he explained it quite confusing- his office hours helped! The readings were confusing/not helpful. Being in pre-vet, I have to juggle other tough classes, but the amount of work homework he gave us was ridiculous. It did not let me accurately utilize time for those other classes.",0
"Really hard for an intro class. His exams were hard and attending class was mandatory because we did a lot of in class assignments. I would not expect an intro class to be so hard. I was really interested in astrology, but this class and professor made me dislike it.",0
"She's a very sweet woman, but she's not a great teacher. She doesn't explain things well and in math there needs to be a certain level of explanation for things to click. You can pass if you do your homework and make good grades on them, see her after class, if you didn't understand something, and see a tutor. I would have failed without a tutor",0
"Very Knowledgeable, very nice",1
"He is an amazing teacher!! Definitely take his classes. He is always available to help and really wants you to do well. If you show effort you will not get a bad grade, guaranteed. He gives homework to be handed in but it makes his tests so much easier if you do it. He's also really funny, always get a good laugh at class",1
"Prof Moscarella is really caring, which makes it even harder to leave a low rating. She wants students to succeed, but she doesn't really seem to understand how to make that possible. The lecture material doesn't match what you're tested on, everything is disorganized, and there are way too many assignments, leaving ZERO time to actually learn.",0
"Really amazing, knowledgable professor who makes the subject interesting even to non-majors and wants to see her students succeed",1
Couldn't ask for a better instructor. Wish she could find time to teach more classes like micro;),1
"He is a great lecturer, and has so much energy that it almost wakes up the whole class. The lectures are very note heavy, but it is not at all hard to keep up. There were a lot of quizzes, but they weren't really that bad, and as long as you study the notes or read the corresponding book sections, the exams are pretty straight forward.",1
"Tests did not reflect anything that was taught in lecture, you are better off learning all the material off of YouTube. He hardly responds to emails and when he does he answers vaguely. He also emails you in the middle of tests to correct his own errors in the creation of the test. He Is not willing to work with students with questions.",0
"Dr. Fischer is a good professor overall. His lectures are hard to follow and he is kind of all over the place, but if you actively engage, you will be fine. Tests are your whole grade. He tests straight from the notes AND lecture. Skip lecture, you wont do well on the test. He provides plenty of extra credit.",1
"Seriously the worst teacher I've ever had. Take my advice and find another teacher. You'll be glad you did. Lectures were incomprehensible, he was really weird and grading on the final SUCKED. he is not consistent with grading at all. AVOID HIM AT ALL COSTS!! :(",0
His class is useless. talk about things he enjoys talking about not what students need to know. One of the worse prof I had.,0
He's great! Lots of homework in Math XL but clear grading criteria. He responds within 24 hours to emails and gives good feedback. He works with you to help you understand material if needed. He's overall just a really cool guy.,1
"Good guy, putrid teacher. He's  nice and funny and will try his best to help if you ask but don't expect anything. He talks very slowly and boringly, but still can't communicate his expectations or assignment criteria. Seems like he doesn't want to be there. He refuses to even give you your grade. Mandatory attendance makes it absolutely unbearable",0
"Fair, easy to understand. Extremely knowledgeable. I would take him for every CS class if I could. Class Layout: 4 projects quizzes every week. I never studied for them, never got lower than a B. Final exam. Come to lectures and pay attention. Ask questions, he is very good about answering them. You will get an A.",1
Probably the worst professor I've ever had. Very inefficient and unclear lectures. Don't think he actually knows the material very well himself. Test questions seem easy but it's impossible to predict what he will demand in terms of answers.,0
"Go to class and do the homework. At the end of the course he will replace extra credit homework grades with low quiz grades, which really helps. Activities are pretty challenging but he is very lenient on when you turn them in. He really expects you to remember the basics from calc 1 and 2. ",0
Read the textbook and go to lectures. The class is at 9:30 but you probably should go because she puts inclass activities on the exam. Mini quizzes are not too hard if you read the book. The exams are made from the book and inclass activities. The final is made of half previous exam q's and new ones. Go to class near the end for extra credit.,1
He's really laid back. Easy class. Just study the handouts and go to class so you know what he wants to ask in the midterms and final.,1
This is my second time in college (going back for another field) and this was honestly the most difficult class I've ever taken. She gives an unreasonable amount of homework and her tests were totally unreasonable. They're all short essay questions and about 30?/test. She is a very slow grader so you don't always know where you stand grade wise.,0
"Professor Sa was a great professor. People dont like him because they may not get the best grades on the weekly lecture assignments. However, if you put in the work, you will succeed in his class. He very organized and such a nice man. I personally loved having him as a psychology professor. I recommend having him as a professor!",1
"Mrs. Myers is committed to seeing her students succeed! She is happy to answer anyone's questions in class & gives plenty of reminders about MyMathLab HW and Quizzes. She is energetic about math, often nerding out over the cool higher-math stuff we ""don't get to learn"". Willing to chat after class, & VERY responsive to email. Generous EC on tests.",1
Do not ever think of taking his courses,0
Honestly the worst professor I have ever had. His class isnt hard but its extremely tedious and time consuming when I rather be doing more important stuff for other classes. Communication is terrible and he never responds to emails. Directions are always unclear and assignments are tedious. Class is a waste of time I havent learned anything.,0
"So I failed the course,but here's where it gets weird, I got an A+ on every assignment - but the exams. She flat out doesnt teach you ANYTHING that is on the exam. she will test you on things that are never covered or are ""not going to be on the exam""-IF YOU CAN HAVE A DIFFERENT PROFFESSOR >SWITCH TO THE OTHER ONE REGARDLESS< THIS PROF WILL FAIL U",0
"An extremely easy class. Emphasis on extremely easy. Professor Fanning is a very nice guy, and he makes the class very easy. I could elaborate further on how easy it is, but all you need to understand is that his class is extremely easy.",1
"Professor shively is a very knowledgeable, enthusiastic, and fun professor to take for anthropology classes. She is always helpful, knows a vast amount on the muslim culturereligion and is a laid back professor. Took this class for a filler and one of the best thus far. Take her if you can!",1
"He is so awesome and has a great personality, but the whole course only has 3 exams that determine your grade and nothing else. So, if you do not do well on them, it reflects your semester grade.",1
"Shortridge isn't as bad as he appears to be, his tests are much easier than Hutson's and he is willing to give curves. Also, if you read his slides you will do well on his tests.",0
Class meet once a week for a 3hr lecture. Only got graded on  4 tests 1 paper and weekly one page opinion papers. Everything that was on a test was always covered in the lectures. I never opened my book once. I went to all the lectures. Dr. Blake gave amazing easy to understand lectures. Final  was optional if you hadn't missed more than 1 lecture,1
"Professor Loftis sucked. He never would clarify what needs to be done and his prefered style for papers goes against what all other teachers taught throught the campus(apparently transitional paragraphs are only filler, and enough to bump your grade down if used) he also gives you liberal speals ever so passively aggressive. overall,dont takehiscla",0
"Lots of assignments, tough to understand. Lectures are also tough to understand. He is available to students and will go over stuff with you if you take the time to ask him.",0
"I took her BUS028A online during the summer. It is the -most-easiest class i have ever had. You only have to do 1 quiz per week, 1 midterm, 2 discussion, 1 final that are multiple choices and there is no time limit. It means that you can do half of your test, and then going out with your boyfriend and then finish the other half when you get home.",1
Funny teacher! Makes lectures apply to real life. Has had alot of real-world experience. Tests aren't hard as long as you study.,1
"Professor Dendy is newer at DBU, but such a great professor. I love DBU, but our english department is not the greatest. Karen Dendy, though, home girl is a gem. I mainly loved the class because of her and her spunk, but I also learned a lot about writing from her!! You are always working on a paper for this class, but they're all pretty enjoyable.",1
"Dr. K is a cool outside of class, but not a great professor. Tests are difficult (multiple choice A-O, extended response worth 30 pts, etc). There was a multiple choice question that 100% of the class got wrong, but wasn't thrown out because we ""should have known it"". When asked for tips for the test, he said ""go to bed early"". Lab is also a mess.",0
"She doesn't explain concepts clearly. A lot of class time is directed towards explanations for simple concepts. It is best to try read a textbook to supplement bad classes. She assigned a group design project the week before finals, due on the last lecture. Her tests are memorization heavy, and focus on specific details from the lectures.",0
"This was so boring. I always dreaded it, and I would almost fall asleep. He lectures the whole time, but it's sooo boring. I learned most things from the textbook.",0
"Professor Brewer is a genuinely nice lady, but Chem 2 is awful. Chem 1 was relatively easy IF you studied. Studying the practice exams gave you a pretty good idea what to expect on the test. In chem 2, however, the practice exams are nothing like the real exam. Unless you read every detail of the book and take perfect notes, you wont do well.",0
"Hands down, GREAT professor. Very enthusiastic about Stats. Wonderful attitude, extremely helpful, and his lecture notes are AWESOME! The class is a bit difficult, but he does his best to break the material down so that everyone understands it. Take him, you won't be sorry. :)",1
Professor Mahallati's INTL 5530 graduate international law course requires a lot of reading. Her use of the socratic method challenged me to research topics more closely and prepare for class. Her questions were insightful and pushed me to higher levels. Course requires a lot of analytical thinking.,1
"You will love Kitz at first, but then the rest of the semester drags on. His lectures don't really contain a lot of great information, but you have to go to them because there is attendance and he picks random things from his lectures to put on the test. He often rambles and doesn't convey a lot of interesting information, going off on tangents.",0
"the self proclaimed ""love doctor"" has such a big ego and grades really harshly.  she always talks about how well known she is and how great her classes are when they are very boring and uninteresting.",0
"Majority of the time you are looking at a power point, he does teach but if you dont undertand get ready because tests will be hard, gives out a list of what to study but wont know whats on the exam. Do the project as soon as you can.",0
"I'm not usually someone that struggles in class to follow along. The information is not hard, but he tends to veer of track on subjects and it makes things more challenging than they need to be.  I thought I would like auditing, but my experience with this class has me reconsidering. I don't think I would take him again.",0
Profesor Gallucci is a great professor! Attend class & take notes and youll be sure to pass. Midterm & final were easy. You have to write two one page papers that are really easy and he is clear with his grading structure.,1
"Lectures drag on forever, talks about the same thing for a while. Portrays his opinions as if they were facts, and occasionally even told the class something that was outright wrong. May or may not respond to e-mails. Test are written very confusingly. Got questions wrong despite knowing subject matter. Takes attendance. Book is not needed. Avoid.",0
"There are only 3 tests and a final (this is where you get most of your points). She lectures only sometimes and she expects you to figure a lot of it out on your own. Be prepared to work hard and struggle at least a little (or for many people, be ready to struggle a lot)!",0
If there is another professor thats available please take it. I was lucky enough to take her class during the corona mess and she did little to nothing in helping us learn the material for the tests and assignments. She responds to students in the most unprofessional of ways. Her office hours are during times when classes are typically going on,0
You'd better be prepared to regurgitate conservative viewpoints and hold Scalia in the same air as Moses and Gerber himself.,0
I would definitely recommend her .,1
Please don't take his class!!!!,0
"People who already know the content do well, everyone else struggles. He is easily frustrated, yells at students for asking questions and is generally unprofessional. Slides come from the textbook we don't have, he doesn't know what's on them. Grading is arbitrary. Worst experience in the program, and I had to take 2 courses from him",0
"One of the laziest online professors I ever had the misfortune of taking. Save your gpa and take another science class because as the previews reviews have stated, he really does not care because he's more concerned about people cheating in his tests (can't even find his questions online anyway?)",0
"He is very nice and quite helpful. Though he will not accept any late/missed assignments. Overall, he is a really good teacher, he knows his course almost perfectly and does not let the course get boring. Also, its a very easy course as long as you're not a total slacker",1
"ANY other professor for FIN300 would be better than him. You can't understand him AT ALL because his accent is so heavy, and when students try to clarify he gets annoyed that he has to repeat himself & makes u feel dumb. Homework is on MindTap and is VERY time consuming, & he even tells you a lot of it wont even be on the exam. Huge waste of time.",0
Easily the best Prof. I've ever taken a class for.,1
THE BEST TEACHER YOU COULD EVER TAKE. EXTREMELY EASY AND JUST AWESOME. MUST TAKE,1
"Grading system is not very good and very frustrating. You will spend hours on this course, if you are really into history then you should be okay. Although the quizzes are timed and you have to get a 90% on each quiz to pass and move on in the course which was very very frustrating for me. But a very informational course!",0
"She is very nice to speak with and easy to ask questions, but she is lecture heavy and talks a bit fast. I found her to be an easy marker and also offered an extra credit mark to boost your grade. Her exam was easy since she gave a study guide but for her class you will need the textbook.",1
Yo Dr. Song was a straight up sav and is an amazing guy with a great sense of humour. He loves teaching and that quality really shows to his students. Assignments and quizzes are reasonable and fairly graded. Glad that I had the opportunity to have such a fantastic prof!,1
"This class is not as bad as many people describe it as . Yes you will have to put in time and effort but hello it's college. Also, he requires a lot of participation but the work is not that bad . It don't take a genius to figure it out . The hardest part is figuring out what to do the first week, but after that it's the same thing every week.",1
"This guy knows his theory, and if you take this class thinking whoop-di-doo I know java, and 2 cents of C without wanting to learn about the most boring theories , and the trashiest code (AWK/LISP) you're gonna struggle, and prob get a C. The professor is funny, can talk about coding for hours, and can teach how to make your code unreadable. Great.",1
"Sherry is a really good prof, caring about students. The organized lectures and exmas are reasonable. If you make efforts, you will get a good mark!",1
"Shes very nice if you ask for help, and very understanding. However, i took this class as an elective and it felt like a major requirement. Overall, i passed the class and learned a lot!",1
"Rhonda does not make my online experience that easy at all. I have 2 classes with her. She has very strange online exams, and she doesn't help prepare you for them at all. I would not recommend taking classes with this prof if you don't need to. Its just added stress in an already stressful time.",0
"He gives worksheets that are extremely difficult and suggests that students use them to prepare for the tests, when they don't really pertain at all. He has few office hours and doesn't even show up to them. He's a tough grader, and strings students along with the hope that they can replace a test with the final (extremely hard). 0/10 don't do it.",0
Some of the material taught in class is painfully boring and nittany notes helped a lot with that! You have to take notes in class as well because no notes are provided online. Good luck asking someone to borrow their notes if you don't go to class. Exams are fair with multichoice questions and short-answer too.,1
"her final was beyond absurd ""a final oral exam"" that we had to meet and conference with her for. she collects all our stuff and never gives it back. doesnt give letter grades, just ""check plus"" (whatever that even is) which makes it hard to know where we stand in the class. you wont know how ur doing until finals week, when it's too late. good luck",0
"Tracy Dalton shows that you don't have to have a doctorate to be an exceptional instructor. She is very organized - she goes the extra mile to provide the resources that you will need. She has a thorough knowledge of what she teaches, puts a lot of work into her classes and students, and is also very charismatic.",1
Narcissist,0
"Worst professor ever. Avoid at all costs. She is soooo unclear with grading criteria and graded very tough. Our lab group asked a ton of questions so that we would get things right, but she always changes her mind about what she wants from you so asking questions doesn't help. Makes a ton of mistakes and thinks it's cute or funny. Extremely unclear",0
"Im in 222 online. As an upper level course its challenging, for an A, but doable. Read, take notes, do posts, 2 papers & study. Rubric is clear & it is what you make it. I found it fascinating & you can get a real sense of the profs expertise in the field. Prof Wood is one of those rare special teachers that inspire & challenge. Highly rec!",1
"Class was easy enough. Weekly writing assignments and three research papers. No tests. I'm not too sure about the grading system though. I got an A- with a 95%. Not sure what this is all about, but it's my only real complaint.",0
Very little knowledge of economics.  VERY unclear about information in the course.  He has no clue what he is talking about.  His lectures and the class are extremely boring.  Tests are difficult to study for.  It always seemed that the information on the tests was not covered.,0
Worst prof I've ever had. I got a 90 in math 31 in high school and still found this to be my most difficult course. She sped through new concepts and spent time rushing through too many examples. I got a B- even though I got 20%+ higher than the class averages on exams. Just does not seem to care about her students at all. Avoid at all costs.,0
"Very tough grader. If you dont do the work with the exact method he teaches he marks it all incorrect. Tests are way to hard, he does simple versions of problems in class, but exams have complicated problems. Would not take again. Do NOT take if you are not a math pro.",0
She is very enthusastic about Biology.  She is easy to work with and will help anyone.  However her test can be difficult at times.,1
"Dr. Hair's lectures are effective in the sense that she's experienced so much of what's covered in her own life. If you come to class most of the time and do all the assignments, I find it nearly impossible to get below a B+ or so. Difficulty aside, Dr. Hair will go to any length to help you with anything related to the class. Great teacher!",1
This guy is a living Encyclopedia Library,0
"His lectures are extremely long and boring! Simply read the slides on your own, and you will get the content he is talking about. There are labs every week which are easy marks, four essays which you submit via his own web server (outside of D2L), and a final which was not bad! Easy course, boring professor, but learned a few things regardless!",0
"She teaches scatterbrained.  One of the basic qualities a teacher should have is organization, but she doesn't have it.  I had an A on all the assignments, but did poorly on the tests because I had to jump around so much in my notes to study just one topic.  People who have had the subjects covered in this class before have the advantage on tests.",0
He taught this class as a masters level class because he kept saying he expected answers as if it was graduate school. Mind you this is an undergraduate class. The department chair knows that students prefer this other professor and that should speak volumes. He knows his stuff but expects us to understand him after the first example.,0
DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!! Tests us on chap. not even gone over in class. 30pgs a chap. 6 chap. a test. Long and boring. No homework except for reading. I was excited before taking this class but not now. Please dont take it.,0
"I wouldn't take this class. This is the first bad teacher I feel like I've ever had in my life. Nice guy, knows what he's talking about, but he just does not know how to teach to students. If you can stand to have facts and information rapid fired at you while your frantically writing notes, then this class would be right up your alley.",0
"AVOID THIS TEACHER FOR MATH FOR EDUCATORS! Answers her own questions incorrectly, your test will have material you never learned, you will have to teach yourself, midterm is 20% of your overall grade and your final is another 20% - and they only have 20 questions. Grades projects toughly. Several people I know have failed this class twice.",0
"pure evil :P... probably one of the worst professors I've had in my 4 years at CSUB.  She knows her stuff, but doesnt teach it well and makes things much harder than they really are.",0
"great and funny teacher, the course was one of my favorite yet!",1
"Ambiguous on instructions. When asked specific questions on assignments, didn't answer them. I had a hard time understanding what was expected of me in the class. Not the worst but certainly not the best.",0
Best teacher ever had. You learn a lot by listening to dr. Thomas.  I know that her class will help me get through life a little easier. Even though the class was difficult for me I will keep trying to understand its importance in my future .  I love dr Thomas and her devotion to the subject at hand.,1
"I wish I had listened to other reviews about her being a slow grader. It was week 4 before we had grades from week 1. This continued throughout the session.    She leaves feedback in odd places that no other professors use, so it's hard to locate.   Zero content in the class ""resources"" tab.   5th professor I've had at APU and by far the worst.",0
I had Roger House for online french 1502 and he was great! No complaints at all and your mark on the final can replace any midterm mark that may not as gone as planned.,1
"She is a terrible teacher for physiology. She was forced to give everyone curves because her tests were always terrible. She goes way too fast, cannot explain anything, but she does try to be nice. Her grading is just....bad...half of the time she doesn't even know what she marked you off for. Avoid her at all costs!",0
"Good Prof, really helpful repeats things till everyone gets them but really hard final and 70 % of the class failed",1
"I heard in years past that this professor was hard. As she is in fact our advisor, I loved taking this class. She gave the majority of the class As. Just put in the time and work and you too can get an A. Definitely a GPA booster.",1
this prof is terrible. Couldn't understand a word he said so don't bother going to class the material isn't too hard to learn from the textbook.,0
Do the recommended homework problems and you should have no problem. She is great at explaining and all around a good teacher!,1
Natalia is from Russia so she has an accent and demands respect from her students. She wants everyone to come to class and pay attention. She is not rude. If you do those things you should be fine. She will go over all the quizzes fully which will make the exams easier. What ever she says will be on the exam will be there.,1
dont know why he is even a professor at such an expensive university. you will learn nothing and you will hear nothing. dont do it to yourself.,0
"He is VERY smart and can lecture for hours without looking at his notes.If you are not an auditory learner, I would not sudgest this class. However, he is a VERY hard grader. But if you do the readings you should be successful.",1
great prof. mid-term was easy. she helps with the labs.,1
"Dr. Hale is a very difficult grader and requires a lot of his students but if you actually care about history and are interested in the subject, there is no other teacher that I would recommend more. I have learned so much in every course I have taken with him. He also cares and is realistic.",1
"This class was great. Super easy: 3 exams, 2 quizzes, and a 3 page paper. The exams are easy as long as you do the reading and come to class. She gives out extra credit for coming to class and participating. The quizzes were cake and so was the paper. Turkel is really nice and easy to talk to. The discussions get pretty interesting as well.",1
Show up and actually pay attention and it's possible to get an A on every test and assignment. She is great at teaching the material step by step and always checks to make sure you understand,1
"She won't actually what or how formulas are applied. Questions, and then next second you see the answers. Could not figure out what is going on. You would be better off reading the book. Just skip the lectures, which are meaningless. ",0
"This ""professor"" is a joke. I can't believe they let this guy teach French. I feel like he coudn't get a job in England so he is here! He needs to give it up and go back to England!",0
"I regret going to class everyday. If this is a gen ed for you, don't take it. He goes off on tangents in lecture, and never sit front row. Reading the book is the only way to pass the exams.",0
"Really cares about what he teaches. When I become a professional, I would like to be like him!!!",1
"Best professor I have ever had at Grand Valley. Loved her. Came into the class and immediately felt her passion, which instantly rubbed off on me. She made me want to change the world. Take her if you can! You will not regret it.",1
Her focus is often skewed towards just grammar and construction not content.,0
"He is by far my most favourite teacher in all of my college careers so far because he is genuine, has a fantastic outlook, and truly enjoys his field of expertise. I constantly recommend him to anybody who would like to really study math and understand the ""why.""  Bravo!",1
"Funny guy, but very hard to follow. A lot of homework, quizzes and 4 exams.. Have not learned anything from him, had to find everything on my own.",0
She is one of the kindest professors at Ramapo. The work she gives you is based upon your own skill set. I would definitely recommend taking her  classes.,1
"Probably my least favorite professor that I've had. His tests were harder than what I was prepared for, and he could be rude. At one point he told the class something like, ""If you're having a hard time, you should consider switching majors."" Would only explain things one way. Taught myself by reading the textbook. Went from an F to a C this way.",0
Good teacher. We had some interesting class and group work which i enjoyed. Be sure to do all your work and put 100% effort into it.,1
Professor Platz is a good professor. She gives a clear criteria on what is wanted and is pretty lenient on most occasions. If you need a writing course to be fullfilled take it with Jenny Platz,1
she doesnt except late work quizz every week and test at the end of that week quizzes are timed and long better know ur material powerpoints are useless dont bother you have to do a pre-school obs. and visit a school very long and you better kno terms to pass replies to emails but takes no crap goood luck,1
Thick accent and a bit of language barrier when she explains things but if you put in the work she wont fail you and she will try to help you get a good grade,1
"This is by far the worst professor I have ever had. He does not know how to teach. He will lecture the whole class on random information and then give you a pop quiz that doesn't even have to do with anything you learned. He doesn't post any grades. When checking in with him to see what my grade was he said ""I don't know calculate it yourself.",0
"Good Lord. NEVER take this guy's class. I took film because that's the field I wanted to go into for a career, Neimi made it the most unbareable class ever. He forces his opinions on you, is never on time, is unprepaired, uninterested in what his students have to say, and makes you feel inferior. Its an easy class, but don't let that fool you.",0
"He is a good professor, terrible spelling, but is passionate about physical activity and is very clear about what information you learn in class will be examined.  Knowledge of a few readings per exam is critical. Overall a good class.",1
Dr. Campbell is a nice lady she really does care for her students and rocks. Geology was one of those dumb liberals I had to take and I thought this class would be a breeze. So obviously I didnt take it seriously... I got As and high Bs on all of the assignments but the tests were awful. 3 tests and I got an 80 76 and 70. And I might Get a c now..,1
She is GREAT. I loved this teacher. She inspired me so much and she is a wonderful person. Take her class.,1
"Truchil's class is the best! We learn a lot by just having a normal conversation, doesn't even feel like a lecture. He makes funny jokes constantly and always does drum and guitar solos. Great class!!",1
"Vraiment mon professeur prÃ©fÃ©rÃ© du programme, peu organisÃ© mais il est attentif et Ã  l'Ã©coute",1
This class is hard. It's unfortunate that it's a required class. Definitely don't take it online/over summer because you are gonna hate doing the work on your own time. There's an ungodly amount of substance to this class almost to the point where it just feels unnecessary. I'm sure Calkins is a nice lady but it's just too much work.,1
He was a really nice person but wasn't a good teacher. He had trouble explaining stuff. Since this was my first calc class I do not have a good understanding of calc 1 and now am in calc 2 trying to play catch up. Test's are worth a lot of your grade and in calc 1 somebody else makes the test so he doesn't know what will be on them.,0
Really easy class. she tries to add things in to the class to make it more complicated but we never end up doing any of the things she says. some really easy quizzes. easy homework. easy projects.. Just read your notes and you will do fine. SUPER EASY!! she is just all over the wall...,0
AJ is a great teacher. She genuinely cares for the class and the deaf community. She's also really funny and understanding. Her passion for ASL and the deaf community is very obvious and infectious. :) Because of her classes I'm considering continuing in ASL to possibly become an interpreter.,1
"I took an online class with him that was not explained very well, I thought it was a work as you go class and I was gone for a week and couldnt do any work and missed a big project and he told me I should withdraw from the class only 3 weeks into the semester. Not a very good educator",0
"Class was very hard to sit through. I couldn't bare it half of the time. Quizzes tend to follow a pattern of every other class, but he never specifies, and sometimes that schedule switches up on you so you really never feel confident about skipping class and running the risk of missing a quiz thats very important for your grade. Lab was easy.",0
She is a very tough grader. I am in her online course so I don't know her to well but I know someone that was in her class that said she was rude. I find the assignments that we have to hand in somewhat unclear. We have to make weekly post and she hasn't given us any grades back on them yet to update us on how we are doing.,0
Very helpful and is an amazing painter!,1
"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS, EVEN IF YOU ARE HALFWAY THROUGH THE YEAR DROP OUT NOW!!! I worked my butt off in this class all year, and now if I pass the exam I pass the class, fail I fail it. It is not worth the hard work. I have lost sleep over this class. Not. Worth. It.",0
"Let's start with the fact that he teaches from his own book that he wrote. His presentations were stale and boring and hard to understand, he is also very careless of job oblogations, especially law enforcement. I had to use the tutoring season and I was told by them that he doesn't teach statistics the correct way. Find a different teacher!",0
"Okay, so this guy has really grown on me. He just has a great sense of humor. For lab though, he's really tough. On reports he says that if we do everything right we get an 8 out of 10. The only way to get a 10 is to do something ""exceptional."" I never got a 10. There are always lab quizzes but no exam. He does bring cookies...",1
It was hard to get the important points from his lectures that were often boring. His grading was unnecessarily harsh for an introductory level course. The average for every assignment was lower than for any class. I would not recommend to anyone taking the class for fun. Made me feel uncomfortable and incompetent when I tried to get help.,0
He has really boring powerpoints that he doesn't post online. It is hard to understand which topics are under which subjects w/out seeing all the powerpoints written down. His exams are really hard b/c they go into more detail than he talks about in class. The averages for the exams were B-. Also it sucks that your grade is only 4 exams.,0
"Mohamedi is one of the rudest professors I have ever met. Not only is she unorganized, but shes condescending and unhelpful. Ive been to her office hours consistently and shes not willing to sit down and explain the concepts. Will never be having her again.",0
"WAY to slow and disrespectful, I have learned to dread math class. I used to love math.",0
This professor goes extremely fast and does not really explain much.  All she does it go over a lot of problems and a couple of the problems that are not done in class are on home works etc.  She is not to helpful at explaining the material.  Also when she asks if anyone has questions she give like 2 seconds before moving on to other problems.,0
His tests are fair but the final was a killer. He went over a 'review' that was not on the final. Gives pop quizzes that will add 1-3 points to final grade; it doesn't really help. Doesn't bend grading scale. I'm a Sr and this is my 1st C. Reads off of pwrpt slides and you don't get anything from showing up. I would not recommend.,0
"Although  Vega seems like a kind person,  his accent is very difficult to understand and he jumps from point to point often.  He is disorganized and following along with him during lecture is near impossible.  His tests are ridiculously hard and no amount of studying could have prepared me for them. Do yourself a favor and choose another teacher. ",0
"I didn't have the chance to take Anton until my senior year this past semester, and I'm glad I was able to. Easily one of my favorite and also most influential professors I had at GV. He's enthusiastic, very knowledgeable, kind, and encouraging. Both this class and this professor had a positive influence on me. Thanks Anton!",1
"Part time  professor and he has own business during daytime. he just graduated from school only few years, it is almost impossible to reach him outside of the class. doesn't reply email until last minute, text message either. his project and assignments are unclear sometimes. if you take his class, ask him questions right after class.",0
"Professor Keeling is just simply not a good Professor.. not really sure how else to put it. His lectures are dry and boring, and he crams about 5-6 chapters of material into one test (not to mention the test questions are 27 questions). If you don't pass the tests, you're not going to pass.",0
Great prof! Explains concepts clearly. Approachable.,1
"Jamie Lash stands out as one of my most memorable and appreciated teachers, not for the subject of FINANCE, that I took under him, but because he sees much further and more deeply than the short-term benefits of these details. He is thinking and looking eternally, at each students salvation and encouraging a life walked in Jesus Christ's footsteps.",1
"Just not a good professor. Treats his students like they are in junior high. Outrageously strict on cell phone usage, no food or drink besides water in a clear container. Not helpful when it comes to wanting to do better in the class. Goes until the bell every day, sometimes over. Not an interesting lecturer. Rude and unhelpful most of the time.",0
"A lot of papers and reading. Dr. Federico is a nice person, but we didn't learn a lot about how to write, which was the point of the course. She also did not put in grades, even when the course ended, so I did not find out what I received on assignments, which was frustrating. Work hard and a B is an achievable grade.",1
hard core knowledge.  funny guy.,1
Funny little man.  Nice and intelligent.  I did not get the grade I wanted in his class but I didin't do much either.,1
10 AutoCAD drawings are due at the end of the semester. He'll walk you through the first 2-3 with pretty clear instructions and then you're on your own. He ended up changing the 10th drawing one week before finals. There were some quizzes and a final that were conceptual questions. I made 70-80 on all of them but an A in the class.,0
"ah dr. mori is so much fun! ""ooo?!"" good times.",1
"Really funny guy. Gives good feedback and suggestions. NEVER uploads grades, assignments, or even the syllabus to D2L.",1
"Her class repeatedly confronts you with phrases like ""CONCISE, MORE SPECIFIC, and WHAT DO THEY MEAN!?"" In two page papers, you are expected to explain the world, why it works the way it works, and delve into the minds of any and all authors... This is one of the more intensive SAGES First-Year Seminars, so choose wisely.",0
This class requires a lot of reading from different sources. You won't be able to reply to discussions without satisfactory knowledge of the topic. His grading is reasonable. The exams are pretty easy. An A is very possible to do.,1
"Blose spends way too much time in class going on tangents about random stuff, not nearly enough time on the material that matters. Avoid at all costs, the most ineffective professor I've ever had at GVSU,",0
"Professor Webster is a quirky old guy. He tends to go off on tangents and mumbles to himself, but his personality makes the class enjoyable. Tough grader, but allows rewrites on all papers. Grade is based off of in-class participation, 2 papers, a midterm, and a final. Doesn't use BlackBoard so you have to keep track of your grade yourself.",1
Thankfully tests are open book. All of class is spent reading power points. We work in groups in a lot for participation grades. She does count points off if you are absent.,0
"Alan is a really nice and funny guy, but DON'T BE FOOLED, THIS IS NOT AN EASY COURSE. This is considered a grad course, it is proof and theory heavy and Alan expects mastery to pass the quizzes (90% perfect answer). Alan writes really creative(sometimes convoluted) quizzes that are hard to prepare for. Read everything and don't skip!",1
"On numerous occasions I have emailed her with no reply. Her syllabus doesn't match what she says in class. We have to watch dumb movies and answer things like ""What repetitions do you notice?"". I'm not even sure what that means. We also have to write 500 words a week on absolutely nothing. She's very nice but her assignments are ridiculous.",0
lecture was pointless...the tests were hard..recitation was more useful..had a 57% in the class overall and ended up with a B..that should say enough...,0
Nice I guess but her class was so boring and she graded so harshly. Answers basically had to be the EXACT words she said in class.,0
Second class I took with her. I'm not going to lie there is a lot of reading. She's very helpful and will push you. Great prof. You've got to put your work in and do your part for a grade.,1
"Dr. Simerka is a brilliant professor. She really knows about what she teachs. If you are one of those lazy students that believe that it is not important to show up to class and do not study, DON'T TAKE HER. If you are one of those students willing to learn, don't put atention to those bad comments about her.",1
"He is a genuinely great guy. Tells fantastic stories, and then incorporates them into lecture. Brought his guitar one day and sang songs while we wrote poems. Half your grade is participation, and the other half is just on a portfolio you submit at the end of the semester of your best 5 poems and a short story. Grading is HARD tho. GL reading notes",1
"His exams have nothing to do with whether you learned the material or not. He simply takes small details from photographs and picture captions and tests your memory, of 8 CHAPTERS AT A TIME!",0
"Professor Ledford is a dynamic, thoughtful lecturer who clearly possesses great passion for his field. I thoroughly  enjoyed his course. However, this class is not for everyone, as the reading is very heavy and writing requirements are steep.",1
"Dr. Bob is without a doubt, and not exaggerating, the worst professor I have ever had. He makes a relatively simple class impossible with his complicated and hard to follow notes. His many quizzes/tests have hopelessly difficult applications on easy concepts. Getting less than 50% is common. He is also very condescending and insults many students.",0
"Prof. Stewart is the BEST! She is well-educated about the topics she discusses, and can relate to many of the real world issues she teaches on. She is funny and quick-witted, and her class was always enjoyable to attend. The workload is light, with a few quizzes and weekly discussion boards, and overall very doable!",1
"ALWAYS LATE, CRITICIZED PERSONAL ASPECTS OF PAPERS, LATE, RAMBLED A LOT, DIDNT GIVE BACK PAPERS IN TIME",0
Awesome proff- I reccomend him.,1
"Listen to me. Listen to these reviews. DO NOT, unless you have no other choice, take this instructor. Just save yourself a semester of pain.",0
"Dr. Walker is a great professor. I have taken him for two classes and I have loved him for both. He is a very funny, caring, respected professor. He is always willing to help out and cares for his students deeply. I would definitely recommend taking him.",1
"She is very boring and will go the entire hour and 40 mins even if she isn't covering any material.  goes off on tangents very easily that annoyed me.  attendance every class, lots of reading thats necessary for essays and tests.  bring laptop to survive!",0
Quirky personality and very interested in what he teaches. Discourages students with hurtful comments and is very unorganized- often misplaces students work (but blames the student).,0
"Braker is very enthusiastic and funny. Field trips and labs are a lot of fun. Doesn't take attendance but uses in class polls to count participation points. Textbook readings aren't useful. Tests focus on lecture material. Tests are a straight forward, esp if you've taken biology (more big picture like ecology, evolution, phylogeny) in high school.",1
great teacher. one of the best english teachers I ever had. challenges you to try harder. hard to get A's on the papers but allows you to do revisions for higher grades. one of the funnest classes I've had at njit. he's big on grammar and helps you fix your bad habits,1
This is one of the worst teachers at the school...Extremely useless and utterly boring...Speaks too much English for being a college level FRENCH class...The accent has got to go! Scary!,0
"Not a good proff!!, very hard marker if you disagree with his opinions,which happens often!",1
"This guy sucks. Pop quizzes every few classes, sometimes 2 in one day so you never know the information to look over. Sometimes, the info isn't on the pop quizzes you learn in class. Not a good personality, if you can take another prof or class, take it. No connection with students, barely even knew our names. Overall, not a good time, hated it.",0
She is very understanding and will help you. I took her as hybrid. I never really came to the class because all you do is basically work on the homework and take notes thats all. I would have taken it online if thats what I knew in the beginning we would do. She made this class easy to understand.,1
BEST TEACHER EVER haha his class is hillarious,1
Typical mathcollege course. NEED to do the work to understand and pass the exams. Ask questions too. Professor Lewis is a great teacher. She was so helpful. Best math teacher Ive had. She committed to helping you learn. Shes not difficult! The math itself is. But it doesnt have to be that way if you put the work/time in that is needed. Simple.,1
She is such a great person and she has so much great advice! The class itself is not all that great but it is super useful to new college students. She makes it her goal for everyone to be able to learn. I highly recommend her if you can get her!,1
"I'm really conflicted about this man... His lectures are usually really detached from the tests and the HW. He is really meant for very math passionate students. Most of his lectures are abstract explorations into where the math comes from. It is very easy to get lost. On the other hand, when you understand the lectures it can be very rewarding.",1
If you are not good at math do NOT take him. He skips a lot of steps he feels are common sense but for those of us not good at math are important to understand the material. Quizzes every week. Doesn't answer questions thoroughly. I never felt comfortable enough to ask questions because of the way he responded to others when they asked.,0
Dr. Butowsky is the best professor I have ever taken at Mason. Do not miss a chance to take one of his classed,1
"Would not ever recommend. He knows his stuff but he expects everyone to get it as easy as he does. Gets upset/irritated when you have questions and dont understand. He will mock you or try to belittle you, Im a good student come to class every day on time and hes still a pain.",0
"The test were too hard, everyone I know of got a 60% or worse but still did great overall. I couldn't listen to him after the first week of class. He's so worthless. ",0
I wish all my teachers at were as dedicated. He's quite interesting to listen to. Too bad it's an online class. ,1
"Dr. Kosnik is lovely. He is super passionate about music, and it shows in his lectures. He keeps his lectures short and engaging. He is by far my favorite professor.",1
"Awesome, informed teacher with a fair grading policy. He will give you challenging assignments, but they're never busy work--they will help you develop the skills you will be using the rest of your career. Truly inspirational; I'm glad he's part of my education at Hofstra. He has an attendance policy that can bump your grade up 1/2 a letter grade.",1
"The average of his exam in our class was a 47% and the average of the final exam was a 51%. Instead of curving the class or giving opportunities for extra points, he wrote a letter to our class saying that he gave plenty of ""free points"" and that we all need to ""be adults"" and take responsibility for our grades. No attempt to rectify the situation.",0
"Professor Greenberg was a good teacher for Math 352. You don't have to buy books, he gives them to you! His tests weren't bad and based on the homework. We had 3 day weekends in the winter because no class on Fridays!",1
"Likeable person;Very interested in topic, brings up some very interesting theories and proven points.  Learned alot about development theories.  Lot of use from the book, which I think he wrote one of them.",1
Shes very interesting. She seems lost but knows how to explain very well through her lectures. Does a lot of group activities though. Not that much homework. Very helpful with your writing if you ask for it. It helps to attend every class and to be organized.,1
"She's really strict and tough on her students, but if you go to her for help, she's surprisingly nice and will help you if you want her help.",1
"Took this class online as a deceivingly easy Gen Ed and that was not the case. He didn't include any of his own teachings - we were entirely dependent on the book and the powerpoints, which came from the book company. For anyone who isn't ecstatic about economics and wants a helpful teacher, this is not the guy for you.",0
"Victor was the best teacher i have ever had. He cares about his students and takes the time out of his day to get to know each students. He has a very fun and creative form of teaching, does not require a textbook and has an awesome personality. He is also hilarious and kind hearted.",1
"I could go on and on. First day of class she claims she doesn't have horns growing out of her head, but I quickly realized that was a lie. She is soo rude and expects so much out of you. The quizzes and exams aren't bad but the paper that is worth 30% of you grade is ridiculous. She expects you to be a damn architecture. Strongly DO NOT recommend.",0
lectures are for videos. the content you teach yourself with the textbook so may as well take it online. weekly quiz based on textbook questions so absolutely need the textbook. overall was very boring but easy class,0
"Professor Peters is one of the nicest professors you will have in college, I cant say enough great things about her. She made the material very interesting and did her absolute best to engage the class. She is also extremely understanding and kind. I dont really understand why the rest of the reviews are negative, she is an amazing person!",1
"The best prof I had at UNBC.  For one of the worst universities in Canada, it has a couple bright lights.  She is one of them.  Interesting, smart, and engaging!  Belongs at McGill or Waterloo, not UNBC!",1
Does not let you make up missed homework everything online and she doesnt clearly go over everything such as tenses,0
"This professor is a f-ing joke. If you want to take a fluff class and learn nothing, take her class. ItÃÂ´s true, sheÃÂ´s hilarious! Hilariously unorganized, undedicated, unprofessional.",0
If you do your work in this class and put effort into it you will get an A.  Wendell is very understanding and caring and you learn a lot from her.  Take her classes!!,1
"Dr. Bayers is a true narcissist. Relative to other English professors ar Fairfield, he's not cutting it. I dreaded his class and would advise other to avoid it at all costs.",0
"I took this class at ZOOM UNIVERSITY. I do not think he is a bad professor, you could tell that he genuinely wanted to teach his students and help them learn. However, I do think that if this class was taken in person he would've been a little more strict in grading since most of my exams were oral exams and the writing portions were open book.",1
"Hummel is disorganized and crams tons of information into each lecture. She displays an apathetic attitude when responding to emails. Her tests (50-75 multiple choice questions) concern details that are easily missed. The only things in the grade book are the tests you take. I, a straight-A student, would never recommend her.",0
"This class is an easy A but the issue is she grades your free response answers on the quizzes, tests, the 2 assignments, and 2 discussion posts with impossible expectations. She says not to plagiarize but then she COPY AND PASTES questions and its answers from the FREE ONLY TEXTBOOK (openstax - American Government 2e). PS who cites for a trivia????",0
"He was kinda of boring, but knowledgeable. Just a midterm, final, and discussion attendance determines your grade. You don't need the book since he has handouts. Hope you get a good TA, since they grade everything. He has a very very generous curve!",1
"Dr. Lockyer is extremely dedicated to her students, both in and out of the classroom. She's supportive and challenging in her classes, and gives honest, straightfoward advice to her advisees. A big asset to Albion students.",1
She is a really caring and wonderful professor. Her class was really easy but just a bit boring. She does have an accent but it's not that bad. She will gladly help any students or clarify.,1
Terrible teacher,1
This was by far the hardest class I have taken here at GV. She absolutely sucked as a professor. Her reading each night was way above our abilities with all our other school work. She didn't care that you were in other classes. She always had quizzes and expected too much out of you. I definitely would switch or drop her class if you have her.,0
He is a terrible teacher.  You do not learn anything.  He is an extreme feminist and likes you if you are the same.,0
"It is one of the best class I took at SFSU. Do your homework, come prepared to class and will get a good grade.",1
You can tell professor Orozco really enjoys his job. I had a 7:30am class and he always came in awake and ready to go. One of the best professors at this school. Please take his philosophy class you will not regret it!,1
I found that Doug was very difficult to deal with as he does not listen to his students.  He is too easy on the slackers by giving them lots of breaks but for those who do their work on time it's very frustrating.,0
Instructor made class interesting and was very knowledgeable.,1
"Chris Green is an old and dogmatic professor, often very confused with his material and unable to speak a sentence without losing track of what he is saying.The class is interesting, be but careful, there is ALOT of material covered. Going to class is useless, just do the readings and read the slides. Overall interesting material but boring prof.",0
Itâs ironic I took geo 100 with him 5 years ago and thought he was the best prof ever so I went into geology. Now for my capstone course he has sucked all the fun out of geology and makes me fell dumb and I donât want to be a geologist any more. Heâs a terrible prof. Avoid at all coast. He gives a lot of pointless homework.,0
"If you have no previous stats knowledge, good luck...",0
"I've never had class with KC, but she is in choir with me and she is so awesome. She is so nice and friendly",1
Very enthusiastic about the material. Tutorials are sort of hard to follow but aren't too difficult. Easy up until the final where a lot of the questions asked you to identify who said which quote. Nothing she emphasized was actually on the test. Presumably done because she said the class average was too high. Otherwise enjoyable prof and class.,1
Although Jadwin can be funny she can also make you want to pull your hair out. Get on her bad side and there is no way back. Switches her attitude real quick.,0
One of the best professor's I have ever encountered.  The guy is on top of things and has a personality that matches. You learn a lot and in a way that is memorable. He get's everybody involved and gives excellent constructive criticism that really challenges you not only as a student but as a person in general.,1
"I took her Disney Lit class, and it was so much fun. The class was not hard, but you have to attend or you'll do bad. She drops your lowest test grade which is nice. She's a really nice lady, and the class was totally worth while!",1
"Avoid! Class is extremely boring and he teaches half the course based on his own bias and beliefs, homework heavy, but he gives you the answers. Content is extremely specific and useless. Not friendly or caring, very loud, often wrong about things he teaches as facts (google fact check him). Says ""out there"" and ""makes sense"" so much I kept a tally",0
"Good prof who seems to actually care about students doing well. She takes time in lectures before tests to go over questions from the class and prepares you well for the exam (she actually gave us most of what we needed to answer the essay q on the final). I slacked off entirely with reading and still got a B+, almost an A.",1
"Okay so I honestly thought Field's class was going to be decent after taking his first exam but however everything goes down hill from there as it just doesnt get progressively harder, it's like a whole different class. He grades pretty hard on essays and says many confusing things thinking everyone should just understand. Hard class,but required!",0
"You have to read everyday because there is a starter question before each class. But he lists every starter question, so most of the time, you don't have to read the whole passage. Every time he goes over a document, it is most likely going to be on the test, so make sure you are familiar with them.",1
"He talks really fast, but if you actually work hard it's a great class. He is very helpful.",1
"Taught us both Thermodynamics and Heat and Mass Transfer and was by far one of the best profs we've had.  It always amazed me that he didn't use any notes in class.  No textbook wasn't a big deal because his notes and examples were so well done.  The finals were a bit rough because it was multiple choice, just make sure you know your stuff!",1
"He is an awesome professor. Go to class, you will learn alots materials that he talks about in the class lecture. Take lecture, pay attention and read book. The grade for this class include 3 essays, some abstracts for reading article, and attendence. Feel free to ask the question, he will answer you best he can.",1
She barely writes the question on the board and works through it she tries to just verbally explain it to you.,0
"one presentation. three small quizzes. the hardest part is executing the lab reports. i thought 3 hours will be enough, it turns out that 3 hours is enough for 50% of the paper. he tried to be funny...fail...but good intention",1
"Eyeopening learning about the music industry. Paul is an expert on it. Very funny guy, makes the students think. Long powerpoint lectures that are not put online so take notes. Quizes and responses are very easy. Midterms/Final are half mult. choice half written, know the study guide and you'll do fine. 1 research paper, start early, its long",1
"I LOVE SRG. CONTA!HE IS THE BEST PROFESSOR AT LACC. VERY VERY HELPFUL IN EVERYTHING. HIS TEST ARE EASY, NO H.W AND IF HE DOES, NEVER COLLECTS IT. HE SHARES A LOT OF HIS EXPERIENCES AS AN OFFICER WHICH ARE AMAZING. AND HIS STORIES HELP AS EXAMPLES OF WHAT THE LECTURES ARE. U WILL NEVER MEET ANOTHER PROF. WHO GOES OVER MID/FINAL TEST ?'S THE DAY B4.",1
"He was great, TA was an ass though. I really enjoyed the class overall. Dr. Hou is hilarious.",1
"He's giving a lot more work to compesate for the lack of teaching , if you ask others that have taken the same class with another professor.  They have no idea what you're going over and wonder why you aren't going over core topics.",0
"She is a kind woman, but not a good professor. She would often go way off topic and we would hardly cover any material in the little time we had. I basically felt as though I had to teach myself accounting. When students would ask questions I felt as though she wasn't understanding what they were asking and she would clearly give wrong answers.",0
"I personally enjoyed Professor Siu's teaching style. She reviews previous material and allows you opportunity to practice it at the beginning of each class. Students are given opportunities to earn points back on exams and drop low quiz or worksheet grades. She is old-fashioned and can be condescending, but I found that I learned well in her class.",1
"My first mistake was taking this class in the summer, more specifically from this professor. On several occasions a student asked him to explain something further and he responded with ""Just write it down and figure it out on your own later."" If you don't have a firm understanding of Calc before the class he is not the professor to take.",0
I love this man. He truly cares about being apart of your academic career. he's real he talks about real issues that are going on and is very open minded. He talks really fast but he's hilarious. He loves wine and he'll teach you about it. Our class had many heart felt moment. TAKE HIS CLASS,1
"Field trips for the Twin Cities History course were great; we got to hear from a lot of cool people. Classes were chock full of fascinating info. Lectures could run long, but were consistent with class length.  As for grading, there were only 3 paper assignments (writing intensive), and he was a fair grader. Would take another class with him!",1
"*online class* This class shouldn't be taken online. Her notes were hard to understand, any feedback from her is non-existent. Self-taught class.",0
She is an absolutely awful teacher who doesn't care about teaching or her students. She grades extremely unfairly and will fail you even if you do all of the assignments and ask for extra help. DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS. Trust me... I would have rather taken a class at 7-8 o'clock rather than take this again.,0
"Hated Dr. Williams. Worst professor ever. I emailed and asked for clarification on assignments, etc just to get NO clarification, just was told to look back and the explanation he gave. I felt humiliated and stupid even communicating with him. I cried when I couldnt figure out the assignments on my own and was extremely stressed.",0
"She's sweet, but I cannot understand her for the life of me. I've tried attending the lectures and she has online lecture recordings but her English is terrible. She's not good at explaining. To do well on the exams you HAVE to KNOW the book front and back and do the online modules and hw. No one did well on her exams, the test averages were awful",0
"He is the worst professor ever! Do not take him unless you have to. Once he literally gave us a paper that was due that next week, on the same day he had the midterm exam. He does not know what he is talking about, and he never provides you with any of the readings he wants you to do online. He is confusing and has no clue what he is talking about!",0
"Pam is a great professor. She really helps you understand everything and let you redo all homework and quizzes, giving you a second chance. We do have a daily prep worksheet for every class,  but they never take up too much time. She is great and I highly recommend her!",1
"Maltby is a great prof. He is always willing to give advice, whether about the class or other topics. He made an effort to get to know everyone's names - and it made a difference in the class. Most exam questions come from the textbook and the multi. choice are tricky. He won't give out high marks for nothing, be prepared to work hard. Great guy!",1
"One of my favorite professors ever. Highly knowledgable, makes history accessible and interesting. Will help in any way possible if you communicate with him. His classes were the most in-depth and hardest I ever took, but they are more than worth it. I have nothing but the highest respect for him, and his classes prepared me for graduate work.",1
"Business Law:  Genuinely nice person, tended to shout in class due to excitement.  Had a definite grading and interactive preference for people who went with him on his Germany trip.  I kept a 15 page outline, attended every class, asked frequent questions, got a ""B"".  Set-up an apt. for 5:45 PM on night, he arrived at 6:05 PM and told me to hurry.",1
"Pretty harsh when asking questions and really knows how to make you feel dumb even if you are right; he loves to use words like ""obviously"" and ""I do not understand what you do not see."" Spent 25-35 hours on labs and got an average of an 80 on all of them. (2) Tests are less than an hour and count 80% of your grade. I have nothing good to say :(",0
"Had this class when it was still named IDS 180, but dang Tyler is the best to take for this course. Not because he teaches you so well but because he makes the class so easy compared to the others. The only difficult-ish assignment is an HTML website you have to build but he just wants the very basic codes. TAKE HIM!!!",1
"Please save your money and do not take professor Rydman. All he do does is lecture throughout the whole class, do not have any engagement with students. You will have quizzes every week about the textbook so you better prepare yourself. He assigns a research paper and is a tough grader. Both midterm exam and final exam will be essay questions.",0
This was the easiest course I have ever taken! You do not need to attend lectures...all the tests are based on the textbooks and the prof gives a test outline before! I got an A and only went to 2 lectures...Best bird course at U of T,1
"He was not a good prof, he was really hard and hard to expect what is going to be on his exams, its hard to even tell you what he wants on his exam questions. Buy the Book its really helpful and the lab is long and boring.",0
"Hes the worst teacher Ive ever had in any subject. And I graduated years ago. Trust all the bad things people are saying. They are not just disgruntled students, I personally aced his classes. Hes just not a good person.",0
"Never would answer a direct question.  Very sarcastic and hard to find when looking for help.  Good comments on papers, and nice about extensions.",0
"Guys, Seriously the best teacher in the game! She is amazing! Take her class!!!!",1
This professor had us read a book that was far out of common comprehension levels. His lecture power points were unhelpful and hard to derive information from. I learned more in discussion section with his TAs than I did from any of his lectures.,0
"He is a great professor who actually cares about his students. He is very insightful and funny which makes you want to come to class. If you are late to a lab, however, he will discount points. He is a great human being and it resonates through his lectures.",1
Tells a lot of stories that do not pertain to class. Horrible grader but tests are easy as long as you go to class. The class itself is interesting.,0
Mary is a very nice professor with lots of good analogies. You're cool prof McCollam!!!,1
"He is a really nice guy and speaks really clear. If you go to class and take notes, you should be fine. There are assigned books, but I never read them and still got an A. Don't buy the books, just lookup important quotes. Tests are just essays, which blows, but if you pay attention it's really easy.",1
Dr. Tabor's class was really amazing. Hands down he is the best professor I've had. He really cares about his students and is very knowledgeable about the classes he teaches. Definitely take his classes if you can!,1
"Took his summer deviance course  3320 he was horrible! He didn't grade tests accurately so he would give big curves, twelve points on one test, to make up for his grading errors that were continuously made . Very forgetful and very unorganized. Do not recommend this teacher! He is an unfair grader and his tests are hard and tricky.",0
"She is a nice lady, however her grading criteria is very unclear. She grades papers kindly, but for tests she will take off points anywhere that she can. She will ask you an opinion question on a test and still take off points. Nice person, but would not recommend for a class that is supposed to be relatively easy. Don't take if you want a good GPA",0
"5 papers, the grade she gives you is random but never lower than a B. She says the textbook matters but it doesn't, not worth the price. Class time isn't anything special so easy to skip. She is very flexible on due dates. Very nice lady, not a great teacher.",1
Interesting discussions . Gives you every chance to do well in the class.,1
"Great philosophy prof! Crystal clear examples and explanations of the text, and the midterm and final are both take home. He marks for attendance, but his lectures contribute a lot to the material so it's not a big deal!",1
"a very artistic person, but at times he was extremely snappy. He did not like if I disagreed with him about my own art. I did all the work, worked hard, but he was argumentative at  times. Other times he was perfectly pleasant, and I can't say he was an unkind person. But his tendency to snap at students once in a while makes the class a but tense.",0
-Soft spoken & difficult to hear his lectures. He reads off his notes & rarely will offer additional examples or explanations when asked to clarify an idea. Backtracks during lecture which can be confusing. Writes small & slow which eats up a huge chunk of class time leaving little time to explain new material or review hw. +No hw due dates.,0
Sometimes rude to students. Not very understanding. Rushes through lectures. Doesn't always give students a change to speak in discussion.,0
"Great classes! Easy to understand, not too hard if you show up and turn things in. Cal is one of the best professors at SUU!",1
"HARD CLASS. He tries to explain it best as possible, but the material is tough. Exams are tough and require a deep understanding. Don't take it unless you actually like biomechanics.",0
"Don't let his ethnicity fool you, he is a perfectly capable professor that can speak clear english (with occasional spelling errors). Classes were not ""super"" entertaining, but were very professional and clear. Assignments given were VERY FAIR and with consistent attention to this course, you will be ok. Tests are also fair and do-able. Good prof",1
"If you want to take a class and memorize definitions word for word and get points taken off if you alter one word, hes your guy. Ask questions but beware hell make you regret it. Good luck (:",0
"Very very smart Professor who can teach anyone thermodynamics. Her lectures and notes were very clear and Dr. Elliot is very approachable as she enjoys any questions about thermodynamics. If you do your part, she will lead you to an A :)",1
"there are only 3 grades in the book and they're all tests, but he wants you to ask for EC. If you go to class, take notes, and pay attention it's an EASY class. His lectures are a little scattered but if you pay attention you will keep up! They're easy to pay attention b/c of the topic. You watch A LOT of video clips. This was my favorite class! ",1
"Online class. Everything is laid out for you + there are no lectures. You read the textbook + do weekly assignments. This might seem nice, but I see no point in having the professor when the textbook does her job for her. Also, midterm/final have 100+ questions that ask you to memorize VERY specific info from the text - poor, lazy test design.",0
"Professor Winkler was a great teacher but his lectures are quite boring. He likes to pair students up almost every class to do a activity, so be ready for that. He grades easy and he helps you out a lot with questions you may have about your paper. Conferences with him before every paper is due are helpful too. Overall a good guy and good class.",1
"Prof. Brown really cares about his class/students. Go to class BEWARE everything was graded based on participation and then the Midterm came out of left field, he was SUPER critical. Do the creative option - he's less harsh than the analytical. Great lectures, but he gets bird-trailed a lot. Would recommend. He also is very into indigenous culture.",1
"Dr. Eager was the best math professor I've had at UW-L. He makes sure you learn the material and prepares you well for the tests. One difficult project but if you go to office hours he is very willing to help. Really long exam reviews before the test worth 5% extra credit on exams...worth it. Take him, he's great.",1
Cares more about color matching his beanies with his sneakers than the material. Look upon his website and despair: csdotindianadotedu/jwhitmer/ This man teaches HTML.  Does not have a doctorate. Did not receive any degree related to computer science. The only possible explanation is nepotism or blackmail.  Always call him Mr. Whitmer.,0
"Amazing teacher, it's a really fun classI never wanted to miss one day. She explains everything so clearly.Don't miss any classes you might get loss with the vocabulary. I highly recommend her as your teacher!",1
I was not happy about this class. Rarely replied to emails. I had no idea how to study for his exams because he was not clear on what we would be tested on. He assigns long papers and is good with telling you how you did on papers. Not every helpful and acted annoyed when you emailed him with questions. This is a retake class. Get new professor.,0
Really funny and somewhat entertaining,1
"She is a boring, monotonous, condescending ""teacher"". She was very unhelpful. One of the worst ""teachers"" I have ever had. Avoid her classes at all costs.",0
"If you go to study session you will get an A in the class, he gives you the whole test at this time.",1
"Had JS for multiple CMAT classes while at UB. While giving a presentation she rolled her eyes and sighed out loud. I dont know why I took her for electives either, but here is a warning: avoid any of the non required courses where she is the teacher. UB has professors that really do a great job and inspire - she isnt one of them.",0
"The material isn't too hard, it's just that professor Hallet isn't that helpful. If you ask for help she won't really help you. Also, there is homework every week. Don't bother asking for any extensions on HW or quizzes, she won't give it to you. Make sure you understand the material and you'll be fine for quizzes & HW. Cheat sheet for final.",0
HARD Expects you to know everything inside and out. She's entertaining and class can be fun but she goes TOO fast and it's all lecture. Know processes and cell types and DONT mispell Botany petal or sepal or its -50 points. SIs are helpful. Lots of studying and time. She takes off points for small mistakes like drawing 2 leafs instead of 1 on test.,1
"He seems like a pretty knowledgeable and nice guy, he's just awful at teaching an introductory class. Lectures are very confusing and he usually skips past slides very quickly. He seems to think the class already knows all the material that is being covered. I'd take him for higher level classes, but not intro!",0
"A beautiful man with a beautiful beard. Great ability to teach, and all around amazing prof. When you have him look forward to a great semester.",1
There really isnt a problem with Anita. There are just too many assignments. I felt like I was in graduate school. I say take this class at a trade school for 100 bucks I think there are also free programs for medical terminology. Im retaking the class for free and transferring the credit over. Way too many papers and discussions a week,0
"His classes are the most intellectually stimulating ones I have taken.  If you like professors that just want you to regurgitate what they tell you on tests, he's not for you.  If you want a professor who will challenge your ability to think and teach problem solving skills, he's your man.",1
"Easiest A you'll ever get. He doesn't take attendance but you do have to participate 5 times throughout the course. If you have social anxiety like myself, just send him an email and you can email him for participation points. Homework, tests, and final are all online and you can just google all the answers. Super nice guy. Take him!",1
"He grades hard. Don't expect a good final grade! He does hold a lot of help-sessions if you want extra help though. As person, he is a great guy.",1
Professor Rikkers is amazing. She goes above and beyond in her lectures and makes sure everyone understands the content. We had online classes which were super easy if you did the readings and watched the videos. Attendance in class is necessary because she explains the outlines ten times better than the book! You will have to study but worth it.,1
"Gross is just a mean guy and someone who gets mad when people dont understand or dont like his teaching style. Although I passed, the class itself was him yelling at us when someone didn't do well on a test.",0
Great Teacher,1
"I had Mrs. Shaw for ECO251 online. She does want to see her students succeed and allows for the reopening of units near the end in case you missed any. She gives good, in person reviews for both the mid term and final. She is kinda full of herself, I was told ""She had already helped us so much"" with no further help when having final reg. trouble.",1
"Just being objective. I challenge you to find a teacher who worse than him in Georgian College. Don was NOT willing to help and didn't care at all. Barely have any further explanation besides reading publisher PPT in a tedious and hypnotic tone.(also talked too much about his personal life in class,had nothing to do with the course materials at all).  If you wanna get good marks in his class, I highly recommend you do some self study and read through the textbook at home. Don't waste your time in his class.",0
Ms. Johnson is such an amazing professor! She basically gives you the answers to the quizzes and test. It was a very easy A,1
"This was a hard class because of the crazy amount of material. I wouldn't recommend taking it. That said, Dr. Lyons is a really nice person and a good professor!",1
"Professor Haidar offers plenty of chances to earn bonus points on the homework and grades with a heavy curve. I was wary of taking his class at first because of the other ratings, but he was one of the best professors I've ever had. He gives plenty of time for questions in class and offers a mix of in person and take home exams.",1
Very good lectures. Interesting topic.  Useful in office hours.,1
He is a nice guy but should not be a professor. He does not teach anything and expects people to know the material before we even mention it in class. His idea of teaching is going over problems that we have not learned yet. Avoid him if you can. The only saving grace to taking him is the curves you will get since the tests are so hard.,0
"Kevin Eubanks is by far my favorite professor. He really cares about his student and making sure you actually learn from the class, in fact learning was so important to him that we did not have any exams all semester because he wanted to spend more time on the topics we discussed so we could learn.",1
Worst Professor Ever.,0
Cerutti was the funniest professor ever. I actually looked forward to going to his class! We formed a bond on like the 2nd class and we were great from then on! Would definitely take him again!,1
"Professor Cirilo is an amazing professor. She's very caring and easy-going on. You do have to read in order to pass this course. The exams are not too tough, as long as you read. The final was a little tougher than the exams. Discussions are fairly easy, but it does require to think some. She does offer extra credit. Very easy A, if you read!",1
"Very nice man and very helpful in explaining things in an understandable way. very interesting at times, has a real passion for teaching which comes though in his lectures. he is a great asset to the college and frankly one of my fav professors",1
"I loved Sara! She's blunt, approachable, and truly does care about her students and her progress. However, even though it is a vital aspect of the class and subject, I could do without the amount of volunteer work since it was personally time consuming and stressful for me. Otherwise, it's a great class!",1
"Get as much time necessary with this professor when writing your memos--midterm memorandum included.  She is not sympathetic and she is redundant as much as she is ambiguous.  The class is boring, but follow the text book to a ""T"" and you should be fine.",0
"His tests are extremely hard. If you must take this class, I recommend a light load, it is very time consuming. His study guides and lectures barely cover anything he asks. The test are timed and questions and very tricky. I was on youtube a lot for better understanding. Also do the extra credit even tho it cost extra, it will help in the end.",0
so boring. so boring the whole class falls asleep within the hour,0
"Sha makes it his personal mission in life to turn you into a better writer, and he always succeeds.  Stone cold brilliant - he'll drop three or four theorists in a single class.  He once taught me about thermodynamics during a lecture, and will regularly terrify you like all good professors should.  Fantastic instructor and person.",1
dont take her...drop if you got her,0
"Tends to stray from the actual class material on a regular basis. Doesn't really focus on what we actually need to learn from the test. VERY IMPORTANT: She gives MANY surprise quizzes, NO warning, so read every little handout before class or she'll get you. Probably the biggest issue is grading and test preparation. She's unclear with expectations.",0
"She's a really interesting person with awesome stories that make the lectures pretty enjoyable. She did have the tendency to go way over my head on tangents that were far too complex for a 100 level class. Her notes were very confusing but all in all, it was a fair course.",1
"learned nothing from his class, totally have no idea about what he's talking about, unreasonable assignments and exam. the midterm is 50 mins for 2 questions, Q1 is to design a online registation system without writing code, can you image? just for copying solution, I don't think 50 mins is enough.",0
"She is such a great person and has fun lectures. She outlines the class very clearly and makes sure we know what to do. There is one paper, 3 exams, and homework for grades. you do have to go to lectures and read because her exams are hard. The final is NOT cumulative so that is nice.",1
"Gives 7 quizzes online, only counts 5 best ones. Only 3 in class exams (includes the final) only counts 2 of them. Need to be in class to listen to lectures (slides are posted online) and read textbook material. Great professor.",1
good cookies. Smart Cookie. friendly. 3rd best prof I've ever had.,1
Lecture's that you can't miss and will put you to sleep. You will have two group presentations and the final exam is close to half of your grade. If you do well with note taking and lectures take him. If not then don't get anywhere near this man.,0
"Flynn is a different professor when he teaches Not-For-Profit. He is very clear and srtaightforward, but he does pick on people for not doing the reading or homework. For ACC407, he doesn't post the homework answers online, so you need to come to is office or, better yet, class to get the solution.",1
Difficult to understand; final exam is not representative of course material. Don't take unless you can teach yourself. No homework.,0
"Most people like him, he was ok but tests are extremely difficult, I'd go in knowing I was going to get an A and end up getting Cs and Bs. He even got mad at our class for having low test scores. I wouldn't highly recommend him if you're aiming for an A",0
"Im ngl, Fontenot's classes give me depression. He's a necessary evil. His projects are heavy and pretty difficult, so it's great project experience, but it's substantially hellish during the process. I am grateful to be challenged, but he challenges you to reach his very high expectations without teaching in class how to get close to it. Good luck",0
"This class has an extremely heavy workload that does not enhance the concepts or themes of the class. Assignments are unclear, rubrics are useless or nonexistent. Lisa tries to help, but the workload is huge and the assignments are really just busy work to her specifications, not knowledge enhancing or helpful. This was my worst class in my field.",0
"Fardad is a funny guy who loves programming but isn't cut out to be a professor. His class is all over the place. He'll try cramming a quiz, lecture, and a lab into a 90min class. Plus he is always sick! He tries to cram 2 lectures into one and it doesn't work. He needs to be more organized. We can't the in-class lab in 10 minutes!",0
"Lectures are so boring. Reading off pp word for word. Her sentences ends in ""right"" and it can be so annoying. But her exams are ok. Her TA W.G. is an unfair grader. He marks you off for teeny tiny irrelevant punctuations as if he has nothing else to do in life. Your grades will be in limbo with this TA. Take another prof. and TA",0
"Honestly best professor ever! He never really gives homework (usually reading chapters), he offers extra credit during the tests, amazing stories about his experiences with artist and music concerts, trust me he is not a normal boring professor!",1
Professor Persaud hands down one of the best professors at southwest. She really does care about students. Make sure you attend class as it is important. You review everything in class. Give test reviews and basically theyre the same as the review. Books are need but both are inexpensive.,1
Best teacher i ever had here so far... If she would teach Anatomy and Physiology i would take her..Basically if u have her. save all of ur exams because u will see it again in the end of the semester.,1
"best teacher I've had, he's a good time forsake might take one of classes just to have him again",1
"does require substantial work. 3-hour lab + at least 3 hours each week for homework + substantial efforts to prepare for the exams. Some foundations of geological knowledge are required as most stuff in the lab, homework, and exams are never explained and students don't know how to work on them. Treat this lab as a 3 credit class in order to pass i",0
This class is extremely difficult. I was never able to meet the standards she presented because she expects so much detail. There are always so many assignments due and many of them take you at least 2 hours. She gives a lot of feedback but rarely gives positive feedback and makes teaching feel more like a grade than something actually enjoyable.,0
One of the two best teachers I've had at Knox,1
"Dan is affable, until you take one of his tests. This is when you realize that maybe he likes to see people squirm and rub their temples in a panic as an overwhelming anxiety attack comes over them when they see that the material they cover in the text and some what in class does not match up with the test. Never again will I take a class of his.",0
"I don't usually review on here because people like to complain even when there isn't a solid reason . Dr. Duplass however, is the worst professor I've ever had. His grading is arbitrary(ignores rubrics), his teaching materials and quizzes are riddled w/ errors, and he is over entitled. If you can avoid him, do yourself a favor.",0
This class was extremely easy and he's a great teacher.,1
If you repeat what he says you're golden. No need to read at all.,0
"This prof is unclear, comes unprepared for lectures, his notes don't follow the textbook, he makes errors with solving the problems. I agree that he is a good specialist in his area, but he doesn't care for the students. For those who don't like his style of teaching, I advise to drop the course and ask for another prof in both ELEC251 and ELEC351.",0
"Peter Baker is a gem. He is passionate and knowledgeable about the subject matter and has interesting stories to tell. You read a lot, but they're pretty interesting books. Very easy grader, won't call on people at random during discussions, likes to talk. Generally a really nice, sweet guy.",1
"Going back to school after 7yrs, I can say that Ms. Slate was probably one of the best English teachers I've ever had. She goes over the basics that you've probably learned back in HS which I find really helpful. She helps you with your writinggrammaretc. Very enjoyable class. I am a better writer today because of her. THANK YOU MS. SLATE!",1
It is helpful if students are proficient in APA style of writing.,1
Most terrible teacher. Never teaches anything and wants to screw everyone all the time. change rules of grading in the middle of the semester so everyone can be screwed more.,0
Please do not waste your money or time. Every 'Awful' and 'Poor' review you read in this thread is unfortunately correct.,0
"Definitely the best professor I've ever had! She respects and cares about her students, and she's so down-to-earth! She always takes time for her students, whether it's for help in class or just a casual conversation. Her  French class is great because it's less memorization and more of applying skills. Definitely take her classes!",1
"He has multiple choice tests and homework that he writes with very unclear, vague language. Any attempt to ask for clarification was met with dismissal or misleading, half information. He simply doesnt care about his students.",0
I loved him. He was so funny. The class was not that bad if you put some effort in. The poetry stuff kind of sucked...but I really liked the class. It almost made me like french. :),1
He really helps your write your papers and sometimes will even bring in random stuff for you to use as sources. You will get an A if you turn in your work and write a decent paper!,1
Joke of the day:  Karen Hammond thinks building houses on flood plains is 'neat'.  Just try to get a job in urban design when you graduate...,0
"I took this class online over the summer and it was a tough class, lots of reading and short answer questions. also lots of group work.. yes.. even though its an ONLINE class lol. If you do all the required readings you should be fine :)",1
he was not helpful at all. was trying my best in his class and drop me supposly becuase of my absences B.S.,0
"Love Professor Beck. He is so passionate about the subject and has a lot of knowledge and experience to share in such an engaging way. He truly understands how to teach students of our generation and I promise you, you won't regret him. Take him!!!!!!!!!!!! His lectures makes the class a breeze because it is enjoyable.",1
"Every week, a set of homework book. Tons of homework",0
Terrible professor. Guarantee he will not help you at his office hours. Boring class. A shame to NC State's CHE department,0
Great guy but lectures were long. He honestly tried to make class more interesting by showing us different songs but a lot is music history which can get boring. Go to class because he takes attendance through in-class quizzes. Very clear about assignments/due dates. The textbook is useful for the Materials of Music and Inquisitive assignments.,1
"If you are an A student, expect a B in his class. Extremely harsh grader! Must work on grading rubric, much too strict. Also was a lot of reading, important to know if you are taking a large amount of credits like I was during the semester I had him.",0
Best ever!,1
"If it weren't for the clicker quizzes nobody would've gone to class. Since we do go, it's him going on and on about his experience at Deloitte while 200-ish first-years are streaming videos on their laptops. You can't study for Clicker or exam questions, as they are mostly common sense (Bob Sproule's interpretation of it anyway). Good luck, kids.",0
"PHIL 110 with Dr. C. He allows up to 6 absences w/o losing 30 points in the class. Bear in mind, your whole grade in the class is comprised of 2 exams ONLY 50-50. So if you dont do so well in the exams and lose 30 points, youre done. The exams compose of multiple choice and essay question. We take LENGTHY notes everyday. He's hilarious though",1
"I was so scared of this class because math isnt my thing. She put those fears to rest. If you can do basic 3rd grade math you are good. She makes the often confusing world of stats totally understandable. Bonus, if you haven't missed any test and have a good enough score at the end of the semester you do not have to take the final!",1
"She sucks!!! She gives assignments that are unclear and your grades will reflect this. She is innaccurate. Hope you like math, because you won't be doing much of anything else. It would have been nice to actually do some things besides math, like maybe learning the terms and testing procedures.",0
"Wrong. Everything is wrong. Assignments full of mistakes and get correct 12 hours before due date. Ambiguous during lectures giving inconsistent information. One formula today, different result tomorrow. TAs have no clue what he's doing and feel bad for us. Very slow and boring lecturer but at least its recorded and can be sped.",0
"James was an awesome professor...when he was there (he managed to cancel class last minute several times...). I adored taking his class, though and I learned a bit, too! He's critical, but aware that this is a beginners photo class, even though some people were pretty professional in that class already. :/ I recommend this class highly, though!",1
"Student-centred, approachable, lectures are interesting and always understandable.  By far, the best graduate course director in the psychology dept.",1
"Lectures are full of information and usually interesting -if- you've done the reading. Occasionally goes on tangents, but they're informative (e.g. how cheese was accidentally discovered). Provides study guide for final that's >95% material that you should know if you paid attention in lecture and discussion. Not an easy class, but worth the work!",1
"Rish is a great teacher and a great guy so helpful, I wish i could take him for every class",1
Super funny; one of the few professors who can actually teach; is more than willing to go over stuff the students don't know,1
"She will ask students of questions that is not in the reading, and she wants the exact answer or it won't help the discussion. Expect to participate. She posts work the day before it is due, leaving students little time to do so. And, she has a heavy accent that many students could not understand. Don't take her class, save yourself the trouble.",0
"Dr. Shulman gave the most boring lectures I've ever had to sit through. The class is based entirely off of 3 tests, and those are the only grades you get. 1/3 of the tests are based off of the textbook, which he doesn't cover at all in class. Overall, a difficult class that was really boring and frustrating because he teaches so poorly.",0
I think that she is a wonderful person but I do not that she is a good professor. The class is three hours in class and then three hours online but the time spent in class she does not spend teaching. It makes it really hard to learn.,0
"Buhler is a good teacher, which can be said for so few CS profs.  He also runs a very organized class.  That's a plus as well, since so few profs know how to do that either.  All around, a very good professor.  Have no fear taking Buhler, his classes are solid.  So what if he's a nerd?",1
takes attendance very seriously! I f you don't want to go to class then take it online. all test are multiple choice so fairly easy but you have to keep up with the readings and notes,0
"This course was a 6-day trip to New York to attend the HRW Film Festival,  Fordham Human Rights Conference, and Columbia Archives. Most of the trip was paid for and the professors were friendly, knowledgeable, and made everyone comfortable. We had planned activities but also time to choose what we wanted to do--one of my best college memories!",1
Absolutely useless. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!,0
She sucks a lot. Do not take this class she cannot teach and is confusing. Be careful as she expects u to write like u were in college for years.,0
dr bob is a strange man. way too smart to be a professor. he should stick to doing black hole research for nasa... regardless he cannot teach whatsoever. I taught myself literally everything but it worked. I also went to his office hours on a weekly basis typically for no reason and he liked me for it. gave me points back on every quiz and exam !!,1
"There is busy work, but not difficult at all. Keep up on your assignments and submit ON TIME. Easy A. The textbook was ""mandatory"" but I never opened it.",1
"Maria is a really great person, and I wish I liked this class but at the end of the day this course was a hot mess. To say it was unorganized and confusing would be an understatement. No one knew what was going on. It was like an unanswered riddle; I can't even say for sure what the course was about, or what I got out of it.",0
"The material is exceptionally interesting (which will get one researching outside of class time), and very dense and dispersed (but there is no other way around it!).  Must listen to lectures 2x and work hard. Really wants one to learn (succeed) by problem solving for oneself, really. Truly cares about learning. Intense in class; chill outside",1
"There isn't enough space for what I want to say about him, but let's just say that he's dry and has practically no teaching skills whatsoever. His notes are the choppiest that I've ever seen, and the book saved me for the final.",0
He was one of the worst teachers I have ever had. I had taken algebra as a junior in high school and got an A. I am struggling to keep my C-. I have taught myself ALL of the content. He also will assign homework or assignments very last minute and you wouldn't know unless you check blackboard 4 hours before class. DO NOT TAKE HIM,0
"Professor Barron is definitely unique. Her lectures were sort of interesting, depends on the day/topic/mood shes in. she is very specific about how she wants things done so just follow her rules and youll be okay.",1
"Possibly the worst Professor. Never had someone who was so useless in lecture bantering on about his golf game and having no ability to answer in class questions. Always contradicting himself by changing class structure and expectations, it is near impossible to do well as there is no set guidelines to do well. This prof will hurt your GPA.",0
"Horrible, arrogant, rude, crude, mean and ridiculous. Everything you need to know is in the txt book--don't come to class(just come to lab)..just marry the text book and you will do better than I did. Try not to get stuck with this guy, he hates his job and his ex wives...",0
Favorite teacher this semester. She is inspirational and funny. Take a class with her!,1
This professor is pretty tough.,0
"I was terrified of theory but she made it so easy.  online, open note tests. doesn't post the notes on blackboard. you have to go to class but she keeps it interesting.  breaks down the writing so that it is much easier.  extremely helpful if you need it. need the book. ",1
"I took this to get rid of some GenEds. Do not take unless you need this for your major. It's too hard and detailed orientated for someone who doesn't want to study history. That being said, I learned a lot and found recitation to be engaging. TAs grade everything so hope that you get a good one. Covers from 500 BC-200AD to emphasize it's A LOT.",1
"His class was amazing! each ""episode"" was interesting and keeps you engaged in the conversation.. the books that are needed are not exactly ""required"" and you dont actually have to do the readings to pass the class or the test. he is very helpful and always open and availble. I WOULD TAKE HIS CLASS AGAIN IN A HEARTBEAT",1
"I would totally recommend taking this class. I took it only to fulfill my art requirement, but I really enjoyed the class. She is a really easy grader, and she barely gives any work. There's a discussion post and a quiz every week, and there are 3-4 really easy projects in the whole class. Taking this class has made me interested in photography.",1
"He goes over the material in lecture pretty well. His test was pretty much from the lecture, but the last question was worth 40 points and combined almost all the concepts he taught. He's kinda boring, but pay attention and make sure you know the homework. That should at least get you a 70 on the test. Intro to BME is curved so much it's funny.",1
"Restricts creative freedom. You're practically forced to abstract your work to her liking before you can start painting. Style is redundant, it's mostly collaging images on Photoshop and regurgitating it onto a canvas. The readings and the questions are a pain. Lastly, it's drawing and painting, wish she didn't restrict it to merely painting.",0
I took astronomy in high school and attended almost every lecture for the class but it was still extremely challenging. Reading the chapters and taking notes in lecture was a breeze and I felt I understood everything until I would get my tests back! Very nit-picky grader for an introductory class and tests basically make up your entire grade.,0
Jeff is a great guy! He offers alot of help and I had him for PPS so the class was insanely easy to begin with. Do the work and it isnt hard my little sister could probably pass the class but Bryant has to have a intro computer course so take this guy and you'll do fine. The only thing I didn't like was it was at 8am,1
One of the best teachers I have had.  He was very organized and informative.,1
"Professor Laberge is by far one of my favorite professors. She's passionate about the material and has very clear grading criteria. There's 5 papers, 2 exams, 1 group project, and weekly hw assignments. If you do the reading and go to class you'll be fine. Her tests are from the power points so definitely look at them!Also she gives extra credit.",1
"Dr. Mathews is a great professor. He can be a difficult grader on essays, but he gives good comments and you really learn from them. I took Brit Lit II with him, and loved it. He is so enthusiastic about literature, and it shows. I gleaned so much from this course. Thank you for making my time at U-Tampa a little better with British Literature!",1
Took her class over the summer online.  The only complaint with the class was the last minute instructions provided just before we gave our speeches.  Otherwise she's passionate and accessible for any issue you have.  I would take her class again.,1
New teacher.. Just kind of regurgitates the notes from another instructor. Will be awesome in a few years with some experience under her belt. Great if you're going into nursing.,1
She's a fair marker and I loved her classes. She made Shakespeare fun and lectures were very detailed. You'll learn a lot,1
REALLY interesting,1
"Although the class is lecture heavy and sometimes boring, its definitely easy. Only 2 online tests and 2 simple presentations. Mr. Dotts is also a really nice man who wants to see his students succeed!",1
"online literature set up clearly.  Assignments due every two weeks.  No tests except exam.  Had to post journals, lengthy unit discussions, 1 short research project. Good readings.  Must meet deadlines, but very fair professor if you read and do the work. Summer online lit. is only 8 weeks long,not 15, so only serious students should attempt.",1
Avoid her at all cost.,0
told me she'd fail me to my face. Nice lady,0
"This is the worst professor I have taken at Texas State. He is constantly rude in his emails, and he does not teach. He is always ATLEAST 15 minutes late to class, and has a 20 minute story to tell why he is late. He does not answer questions asked in class and all he talks about his life the whole lecture. VERY RUDE, had to teach myself",0
A lot of people think he isn't a good professor but I think that people who say that aren't used to working hard for their grades or doing work at home. His outlines are the holy grail to the tests so as long as you study it religiously you will have no problem getting a good grade.,1
"Dr. Schnoebelen is a good teacher, but I found she didn't often explain things well enough for the lab write-up. I relied more on my TA than the professor in understanding what the labs were about. Her lab write ups are easy, although some TAs do grade hard. Make sure you know exactly what YOUR Ta wants.",1
"As an honors student I'm used to a high GPA and generally understanding/being able to handle what classes I take. Should've read the reviews. She is an awful teacher. Doesn't go over readings, doesn't prepare you AT ALL for her exams so you'll never know what you're going to get. Ridiculous expectations. Do not take her class, your GPA will suffer.",0
"4 people in our class of 32 passed Professor Konya's Calculus 1 class. I understand that this is not an easy subject, but when 8% of the class receives passing grades it is no longer about how the students are failing to understand the concepts, but rather about how the teacher is failing to teach.",0
"do not understand the hype. class started out interesting but throughout the semester it became boring even my TA thought so. wish i went with the other professor. thank god my TA was really fun, she saved the class for me",0
"Professor Di Bella was very difficult to understand in his lectures. He speaks very quickly and never stops for the entire 3 hours, it is IMPOSSIBLE to take notes in his class. It is easy to get an ""A"", if you attend every single one of his classes, but if you miss any of the video dates (which are not scheduled), your grade will drop significantly",0
"Spanish 105 was the most miserable class I have ever been in. Profesora Burrell is the worst professor I have ever had. She's lazy and useless. Funny, though. Definitely don't take this class if you give a crap about your grades or learning anything.",0
"Wow! What a truly amazing teacher. Very professional, cares about his students, goes the extra mile to make sure you are actually learning, kind, compassionate, funny! Wish I could put him in a little box and carry him around with me. Just makes you feel good about coming back to college and having to take Kindergarten Math : )  Just love this guy.",1
"Nice guy, very smart. Sometimes you can get drowned in the reading and fall behind, but the class is mostly papers so you won't get blindsided with tests or quizzes.",1
She is not helpful at all for a graduate course I had to take.  Does not have the  SME of anything but very good at shuffling paperwork required by the school.  Provides very harsh comments in an untimely fashion.  She assumes you will fail from the beginning.  You are better off to go to any other online schools for your graduate degree.,0
Great representational skills! Makes class fun and interesting.,1
Very organized online course. Everything was easy to find. Instructor was very responsive when I asked questions in e-mail.,1
Great professor! Very helpful and has a great sense of humor! Classes are very well structured and tests are very easy if you study the notes.  He is very willing to help on any problems.  Take Moes for any Psych class if you can...well worth it!,1
"Trina is a very bright and loving teacher. She prepared me unbelievably well for Chem 151/152. That being said, her 130 class was still no joke. There are at least 100 assignments and she is quite nit picky. I had a 95% average on her exams and did every assignment, but finished with like a 90.9%. She is still phenomenal though, the best for 130.",1
Professor Nielsen was very kind and sweet every single day in class. The one thing that I would criticize is the somewhat difficult to understand criteria for submissions and projects- a lot of the directions are difficult to understand and the portfolio submission process was very confusing because of the confusing directions she gave us.,1
"Worst ever.  Not even joking.  Had to take this because I'm a Math major, made me consider switching to Biology.  First time i failed a test in MY LIFE was her class, even though i got 90s and 100s on her assignments.  IF U CAN AVOID IT, DONT TAKE HER CLASSES",0
He was the best prof and advisor I had the entire time at WNEC,1
"Prof. German was a great professor, he has this really goofy personality that keeps you engaged and interested in the material and the class and he was always really understanding when it came to deadlines and make up work. I learned a lot of java under him, and I don't think I would've passed IU's Data Structures class without his help.",1
"Williams is seriously an amazing professor! He really cares about his students and takes the time to learn every student by name! His lectures are really interesting and he makes them fun! There really isn't any homework in this class, but there are weekly quizzes (so easy)! The tests are all writing, but just study and you'll be fine.",1
Powell is the elite professor of the Political Science department. Not the easiest of the dept. but is surely the best.,1
I don't think he cares any more...,1
Honestly she is a super nice professor. Her lectures are really long but she really goes into detail about what will be on the tests. If you are going to take this class I definitely recommend actually going to class because her tests are literally taken from the things that she says in class. Overall she is a really good professor.,1
"Good teacher, annoying at points, talks while you are working, you feel like begging him to shut up. overly encouraging to the point you want to rip your hair out. can't read his handwriting.",1
"I heard this class was an easy A, but boring as hell! There is A LOT of stupid busy work and the exams are pretty crucial.  The only reason I got an A on the midterm was because the review sheet is almost identical to the exam.  Attendence is not mandatory at all, but make sure you're there to watch the videos. Plus he's hot..in a santa claus way!!",0
"Online class.  The class is listed under Dr. McHann, the entire class is lectured, graded and instructed by Prof Frost (tough grader).  Gave all 3's because McHann was nonexistent.  Living Case Study of 30 pages, along with a cumulative final exam.  Weekly quiz's and weekly research plus group DQ's.  Spend at least 20+ hours a week.  Good Luck!!!!!",1
"Very tough assignments with very little time to complete them. Quizzes throughout the semester, final is cumulative and  the only test of the semester (and no specifics about the test are given. Basically just says to know everything from the readings, homeworks, quizzes, projects, and lectures). ",0
"Media Advertising class with Jacquie was great.  This was my first advertising class I had taken and I know now that I want to keep Advertising as a minor after this class.  Jacquie is great, she can be extremely tough at times but she challenges you to think in new ways.  Very helpful and knowledgeable.",1
"Can't stay on topic in class. Tests you (extremely difficultly) on material you did not ever discuss in class, because he was too busy getting on his soap box for an hour. Also grades on whether your opinion on politics mirrors his- didn't think professors actually did this, I'm disgusted.",0
"Terrible teaching ability, nice guy, but the class was a huge frustration, I learned little and there is no lecture just presentations, he needs more organization and teaching ability, he thought he was making the class easy but was making it more difficult.",0
"I would highly recommend her if you're looking for a fun, engaging, educational, intelligent professor who is passionate about her class. As an art history student, I loved taking this class. Even though the topic, Italian Renaissance is a toughy, it wasn't for me. One of the easiest classes I've taken here at DePaul!",1
I took his hybrid class for Fridays only. He was always nice. Class starts at 9:30 and thats when he will start lecturing. attendance matters because you have a quiz every class. He tells you everything you need to know for quizzes. Just do the key terms he gives you and any other small assignments and the class is a breeze.,1
"Worst professor ever. Last time I remembered Im taking intro psychology not an English class. My English class doesnt even make us write as much as she makes us. The discussion feel like essays. She so picky with grades, takes off points for the littlest things. Doesnt even give you feed back. I will never ever take a class with this professor.",0
"Very nice guy, cares about students and wants to teach. Lots of reading but they're well picked for what the lectures are about. Tests aren't bad. He'll really encourage participation. Great choice for an introductory class",1
"he's not exactly a good professor. If you have to take him, don't sweat it but I wouldn't choose to have him. Nobody really knows what he's talking about, but he usually gives an overall feeling of what the exams look like. Grade is based on the lower of your test grade and hw grade, so it's important that you do your hw. Not impossible to get A/B",0
"He always tries to sort an issue if he can and is very prompt in doing so. Yes, this course is very reading heavy but if you know the course content you will do well. His quizzes are straightforward and based entirely on the content taught. Good professor and tries to make online teaching interesting by adding music clips on lecture videos.",1
"He was a really nice professor and wanted all of his students to succeed. Pay attention, take notes, do not skip class. He gives 3 exams. Final exam not cumulative.",1
He is very passionate about astronomy. Tests aren't hard if you attend lectures and review sessions because they're based directly off the study guides and he tells you exactly what he's looking for. He's very kind and approachable but can go off on tangents and lectures can be a bit boring.,1
"Everything is lined out and the teacher follows according to her plan.  Reading with weekly tests and end of unit tests.  One major project that you work on with an assigned group (yes, group project) however it seems to work out well with what the project is.",1
Don't get on his bad side. Not very understanding. Everything must be done his way or no credit. Makes multiple uncalled for political jabs.,0
Great course & I learned a tremendous amount. I was willing to work and benefitted from the challenge. Thats why I'm at university - my attitude is very different from what I've read from others here. If you're lazy don't bother with this course. Go back to primary school and STOP complaining about good profs who want to engage your mind!,1
It was an easy A and only had 2 tests and research paper that I got a 100 on because I do not think she even read it. She does take attendance every class. I did not learn that much and was able to do my other work during that class. Do not take her class if you actually want to learn about child and adolescent development.,0
I cannot stress how amazing of a teacher and person Mrs. Hoyt is. Her lectures are very entertaining and well planned to keep the attention of the students. Go to her office hours. She will be delighted to help you out in any way possible and reward you for showing you care about your grade. You'll learn economics with her as your teacher,1
"Really great CS professor.  Has some high expectations to drive you, but nothing crushing (except the midterm!  Just accept that that one is gonna happen).  Overall, I think he paces the class well to make sure you really get the material.",1
Personnellement je n'ai pas aimÃ©  l'enseignement de ce professeur. C'est trÃ¨s magistral et c'est trÃ¨s difficile d'intervenir. Les examens sont trÃ¨s difficile.,1
She is not one to give you a break if you are falling behind. She accepts you to spend every waking moment studying spanish so if you have a job forget it,0
"She is SO understanding, allowed us to postpone presentations and hand in our TAKE HOME final exam write-ups three weeks after school was done. Really nice, really smart, really great human being! I learned a lot!",1
"This class, related to biology, is going to be really hard no matter who you take it with. Textbook and consistent reading is a must. Pay attention during the lecture. Three exams, multiple choice. You have to really study and understand concepts in order to pass. I'm a straight A student but even doing my best will at most get me a B or C here. ",1
"Awesome professor! She is great in class, really tells a lot of good stories. It may take a couple days for her to email you back, but she gave us her cell phone and she always texts back quickly. Very nice, let me turn in late work.",1
"Awful. Publicly humiliated students for being 30 seconds late, made us feel stupid, went off on tangents 3x every lecture, and was just overall an unpleasant person to be around. I did NOT learn much; he focused more on formatting and citations rather than the actual content.",0
"Had Mrs Sumi a long while ago, but learned she continues to teach here after a friends daughter attended Northwood. Highly respected. She and Mr. Bennett were my favorite accounting instructors. Accounting IS ""fun!",1
"he is an entertainer and not a teacher,,for sure he was a struggling student in his past and that's why his grading is off and complicate this easy calss.don't  take him, i always showed and studied and he gave me C. his class should be called C class and not economics",0
"Willey is difficult to follow in his lectures. He moves quickly and doesn't take time to properly explain concepts. Lectures ended up being a big waste of time. Don't worry too much about lectures though, you can do all assignments/exams without attending a single lecture and pass no problem. Not ideal for a capstone; didn't learn much at all.",0
"He really is a nice guy, he's just not the best teacher. He always gets a befuddled expression when a student asks a question- and half the time he doesn't know what the answer is. There's no rhythm or flow to the progression of material he teaches and nothing is bolded on his slides so it's really difficult to know what he's wanting us to learn.",0
"Doctor Weiner is a very tough teacher to have for such a tough class. More than half of my class dropped the class before it even hit half the semester. I had a huge issue with him and that's why I dropped. He screamed at me in front of the whole class and didn't even let me explain what happened. After that, he constantly brought it up.",0
"she is an amazing professor. she wants everyone to pass. this class has 3 exams, not cum. and your mindtap, that's it. she doesn't curve or offer extra credit so study but she gives study guides that outline the important parts of the powerpoints. super easy, super sweet. honestly if you have the opportunity to take more classes with her do it",1
"On BB, he has notes for each chapter that is only about a 1-2 pages long and that is what you are tested over. You literally don't have to do anything except read those for the tests. Really nice guy and his emails and notes are funny. Don't bother buying the textbook or the access code online, they were never used. ",1
"Take this class and you'll be sorry. He pulls up the book online, throws it up on the projector, and reads directly out of it for the whole class period. While he's doing that he explains how the book is meant for mathematicians, not students. His grading system seems completely random and will give you 0 on a question almost randomly. Do not take.",0
"I like Japanese, and I took the basic classes in my freshman year. She was nice at first, but gradually she started being mean. Maybe because I was a bit undisciplined and sometimes asked weird questions in classes or because I'm an international student that she kinda looked down on me. Just my opinion. I'm not positive about my Japanese anymore.",1
She breezes through the material as if it's review for everyone.  A lot of the time she posts graded iClicker questions that she has barely covered.  Absolutely horrible; avoid at all costs. ,0
"DK was nice and all, but I didn't like his research methods.  I think it's annoying how he tries to be ""hip"" like his students and that seems extremely condescending, manipulative, and fake.  Also, talks too much about himself and how awesome he is and received and replied to text messages during his lecture.",0
"He's great. Just take him. He cares mostly about getting good discussions going and having a good time with the class. I swear if grades weren't required, he wouldn't make you write anything. It's not a poetry analyzing and writing about it kind of class.  It's largely discussion and he's so so passionate about it that it makes you love him.",1
"He was a wonderful professor, explains very well and is very passionate about what he teaches. He likes when you participate and he doesn't overwhelm you with course work. Notes: show up to his class, don't disrupt his class, take notes he doesn't post slides, he takes long to mark. Would take this class again had a lot of fun with him as a prof",1
Definitely need to do the homeworks in order to understand the material. Very nice person and a helpful professor but not always clear. Grade is entirely weekly quizes and final but he dropped three or four quizzes. Wants students to succeed and always answers questions but isn't always great in conveying the material efficiently. Pretty easy class,1
"Talks entirely too much during class (especially for a 400-level one), talking points are incredibly repetitive, extremely flaky.  He does have extensive and interesting knowledge of critical theory, though.",0
"I did not enjoy his class, but I took a 6-week fast track online course. There were way to many videos in way too little time and you had to watch every single one to pass. I wouldn't take that specific class again, but I would take this professor again. He is very enthusiastic and helpful. He is also an easy grader. Don't recommend online for him.",1
"One of my favorite professors. I'm going to do my research with her and have already taken 3 classes with her. She's a tough grader, but she wants the best for all of her students as long as they put in effort to do well. She is LGBTQ+ friendly, which was a relief for me. She will sit down with you to review papers before you turn them in.",1
"absolutely irresponsible, the worst prof ever!",0
"Prof. Marchand is clearly passionate about what she teaches, & her lectures are always interesting! Quite a bit of reading, some of it was dense, but she provided great reading guides for the tougher books. Grades are clicker points, exams, & a ""research"" project (not just a paper). Her lectures can get scattered, be prepared to type quickly!",1
Awesome! hightly recommend!,1
"Awful doesn't begin to describe Professor Knocke's teaching style as well as his overall conduct of being a professor. Constantly changes project expectations and grading criteria. Never gives student's a page with project expectations, just rambles about them during class and changes them every other day. Extremely unprofessional, waste of time.",0
Cathey is the worst Professor Ive ever had. I had a 4.0 before taking him. Grade comes almost entirely from 3 tests. Doesnt provide a study guide and tells students not to study homework problems because they dont match the tests. Rude and sarcastic. Said 50% of the class always fails yet spends more time discussing his life than on examples.,0
Prof Mawani is really full of herself!! She is interested in you only if you are interested in what she is interested in.,0
Initially I thought he was lost and disorganized but within weeks his confidence level went up and it became the most interesting course that term. He has a great passion and interest level for his subject and engages students to think rather than giving them answers right away during office hours. Overall he made me thoroughly enjoy enumeration.,1
"Somehow the class went towards religion, which it is not at all!",0
I feel bad.. but she's a pretty bad teacher. I'm taking her now and I'm so excited for December to come around.. She assigns an assload of busy work just because.. she's really vague and an over all poor teacher. She will discuss essays and she's actually pretty helpful about that.. but that's pretty much it.,0
"She's a really good teacher and the assignments are easy but she's really big on attendance, she is really fun to work with. As long as you go to class nd do your work you ae sure to pass,",1
"Be sure to do connect HW. She is very helpful, and loves what she teaches. If your having a crazy day, she is the type of instructor that can make you laugh and have fun while learning.Our whole class like her. She brings cupcakes for your cumpleanos (Birthday). Quizzes are easy just pay attn. Test require some preparation, but not overload.",1
Completely terrible. Avoid at all costs. He assigns material without letting you know how to do it and when he grades it he gives you half credit for doing wrong ??  Any who he isnt organized we completed the last 4 chapters in 2 weeks which was rushed and basically all on the final. Terrible Professor.,0
She is an easy grader and it is very easy to pass the class. She gives a good amount of extra credit and the quizzes are made easy to pass because you get to take them twice. She is a great professor and cares about her students grades.,1
"Dr. Besner is an awesome professor. It is not hard to do well as long as you show up and do the readings. He says what he feels, but don't be afraid when presenting.",1
"He is a brilliant man, but is not clear in his directions when assigning papers. You MUST work with him and go to his office hours for help with every assignment and for getting materials or you WILL NOT get an A!",0
"JTerm was easier than the full semester. She takes into consideration that students only have 11 days to complete the course so everything is cut down to accomodate the time crunch. She tells good stories, laughs a lot at her own jokes. Highly recommend JTerm to get 3 credits out of the way, but u gotta do the work.",1
"Hunt's lectures for this course were unorganized, difficult to follow, and had no visual supplementation (stay away if you are a visual learner, she just lectures). She assigns an extensive amount of reading outside of class, yet doesn't elaborate on the reading assignments during lecture. Whole grade is based on 2 exams, good luck.",0
"Gauss is fine. You really either are fine with him or you cant stand him because his class isnt very engaging. I got an A on every one of his papers, but you need to make sure you study for the midterm and final (heavily weighted). 400 pts: 100 pt midterm, 100 pt final, five 2 pt reaction papers, a 40 pt paper, and three 50 pt papers.",1
"She is a very nice lady that is always willing to help. Essays and readings are quite hard, and I don't recommend procrastinating on the research. There are four total essays, but she explains everything pretty well. The last essay was around 8-10 pages. If you don't get at least a C or higher on these, then you will fail.",1
"gets off topic by talking about calculators, but everything and more seems to be on the exams",0
Don't take this class if you don't have to. You have a quiz at the beginning of every class on the chapter read in the book. The exams are difficult and hard to study for. The professor doesn't help much with teaching the material you basically have to learn it yourself.,0
"Dr. Grapenthin is lovely. While the class was a little tough, I enjoyed it a lot, and I enjoyed having occasional conversations with her. She's a very interesting person if you get to know her.  I would and am taking her again!",1
"Best math professor ever. Cared more about some of the students grades than they themselves did. Committed to your success. Lectures are crystal clear, I now have a new passion for math. Most importantly, I learned a lot and felt challenged to do better. Definitely taking her in the future.",1
"This guy's english is terrible, and his classroom presentation is mostly useless. The graphics class though is really cool, even though the assignments are time-consuming. My advice is to study the slides and learn with online resources.",0
Great professor. I've taken 3 classes with him because I learn a lot and he is very easy to work with. His class is challenging but I felt very comfortable with the work.,1
Shes the best and I would like to have kids with her,1
Burkhart's class was a struggle. He gives you a seventy page case study to read to simply ask on the quiz what science organizations were used through out the case. To me it seems like a lot of busy work. The class is not worth it. Nothing but MIND GAMES. I personally was not a fan of the class and would HIGHLY HIGHLY advise against it.,0
"Even though this was a COVID-19 semester, Anton did such a great job trying to make it somewhat normal! He is easily approachable and wants to help you succeed in his class. He knows that this is a hard class and you have to put in the work but he will help you with whatever often. Overall, really great professor and a really interesting class.",1
He is a very hard man. The only reason people put effort forth in this class is because they are scared out of their mind of him. He likes to publicly humiliate his students and will call you stupid to your face. He will mock you constantly and will make you feel like an idiot every time you mess up.,0
"She is great. Dr. Ehrhardt is opinionated, educated, and dedicated to accepting students. She loves hard workers. If you pay attention and do the readings she will reward you with food and an open space to talk. Her class has been my favorite class at OU.",1
"I highly recommend not taking any of his classes. Don't get me wrong, he is a great guy. The issues I had with him were his way of teaching which is super disorganized, the lack of assignments (2 or 3), and he never gave me any feedback on my assignments unless I emailed him and asked for them! I didn't get my final paper grade until after my final",0
"Worst professor I have ever had, do not take her course. She added no value to the course and I was required to teach myself the material. Some constructive feedback for her, spending the entire class going through problems without any lectures over the necessary concepts is not helpful and only causes confusion. Please add lectures to your courses",0
Kris Felstead is definitely a great teacher :),1
Dr. Alali is a very understanding professor. I went through a rough patch in the beginning of the course when I was unable to take an exam due to a funeral and he helped me through it . I was in his Health Communications course online and it was fairly easy and he focused on his syllabus and never goes off course. Hands down a good professor !,1
Mr. Caldwell went through math problems way too fast and got irritated if you stopped him with a question.  Majority of the class was frusterated with this teacher.  Did not pass his class... took same class from another teacher in the summer and got an A... Figure that problem out Mr. Caldwell!,0
best class at UNO,1
Avoid at all costs. I do not understand how professor Pietro is getting good ratings on this. He is a terrible professor. His tests are extremely difficult. I had many mental breakdowns throughout the semester. Attend his lectures because he uses many formulas that are not in the textbook. He is not clear on what he is testing you on for tests.,0
Mr. T is great.  He understands this is an intro course and makes sure you understand the fundamentals.  He does exactly what he says he is going to.  There are quizzes every lecture and he offered extra credit on top of it.  If you do not pass this class with a B or better you are just lazy.  He was awesome!,1
"He is such a nice guy which is why I gave him three stars. That being said, he is so disorganized that his lectures were painful to bear through. His handwriting is impossible to read and he gets off topic every 10 seconds. I had to teach myself all the material.",1
She is a good teacher but isn't as helpful as people say. I asked for help all semester and she kept emailing me to go to the math lab or come 30 minutes before class but that wasn't enough time. She is rude and doesn't care about your concerns. Would've passed with a B but she wouldn't give me the help I needed.,0
"I've had Dr. Jacobson for 2 classes and an independent study. She is extremely helpful and really wants all her students to both understand and succeed. She assigns a lot of reading, so be prepared, but she almost always selects interesting reads. She is brilliant.",1
I think he is good professor but I didnt like the way he taught statistics compared to my sta1001 professor but overall you will learn. He will drop your 5 lowest quizzes and gives you a lot of extra credit. Its really important to know the formulas because you won't be allowed to bring anything in the testing center except your calculator.,1
"I took Peter's class as part of the Geography of Polar Regions. Peter was easy to get along with and really knows his GIS. His GIS labs were more geared towards people who had previous knowledge of ARCGIS. However, with Peter's teaching, I grew to actually like GIS and get the hang of it.",1
Literally started grading all of our assignments after week 4. This was terrible because after she checked my first essay and gave me feedback there was no way to use the feedback for the rest of my assignments because they are already turned in. Another annoying thing was the absolute lack of instructions for all assignments.,0
"Adelle is a really sweet professor. You can tell she is interested and knowledgeable about what she's teaching. The quizzes, midterm, and final are all pretty straight-forward, just make sure you take good notes from the textbook and lectures.",1
"She is a great prof who knows how to keep the class interested by making it fun! She also really cares about her students, I highly recommend taking her for any course.",1
he is not clear at all about what he wants,0
"This is genuinely the worst instructor I have ever had. He is rude, condescending and extremely harsh in his grading. He does not respond to emails and is rarely present during office hours. Class consists of 15 minutes of verbal roll call followed by 20 minutes of a verbatim reading of the already posted notes. Tests are nothing like the homework.",0
"Dr. Wallace is the best STEM prof you could ask for. Explains concepts really well and clearly cares about his students. The class itself isn't that bad. Exams are more difficult than problems in class, but they aren't too much of a stretch. The final was really hard though, so don't let it catch you off guard! Also no curve, so don't count on it",1
"She is not a good teacher. She is very knowledgeable about physics, but she is not a good teacher. I have gone to her office hours, and she is a really nice person; however, she is a HORRIBLE teacher.",0
I really enjoyed the class and I like how she tries to memorize all the students names. She really does care about your grade and is willing to give you feedback on things. The study guide for the exam only helps for the written part so beware of that. Its not a super hard class but you will have to try for your grade.,1
"Paul doesn't use moodle. It is frusterating enough to be online but he takes all his assignments and sends them out through moodle. He doesn't give any warning and just sends an email with an assignment that ""due tomorrow!"" He's also lost 3 of my assignments somehow. Not a class for me.",0
"This class was harshly graded all around, unlike the last AMS class I took they did not scale the grades.  I made the lowest grade I've ever made in this class, and I attended class and did all of the assigned readings and studied accordingly.  All tests are done with scantrons and ask ridiculous questions.  Do not take this class.",0
The pro is out of date. The text book is out of date. The eiffel language is out of date. And the lectures are not well explained.,0
"He is very nice.  He will make you feel like he is judging your every move.  He will appreciate any contribution you make to discussion.  His syllabus, yes, is outdated and his grading is harsh, and he will try to make you care about stupid literature which no one cares about.  There is a lot of writing, and little room for extra credit.",0
"I wanna give this guy the benefit of the doubt, because I think he is a smart guy, but man...his accent is impossible.  Mumbles too, couldn't hear a word so I just never went to class...ever.  Didn't buy the text either, but still got an A thanks to my good friend Wikipedia...easy class, but don't even bother attending, it's worthless to go.",0
"Dave Boden is great! He is a great teacher and his power points are very lucid. If you just go to class, take notes, pay attention, you will pass this class. Dave explains  the material so well, and he is always there for help. This was definitely one of my easiest class, but he loves when you are very very very very descriptive in all the labs.",1
Very good teacher with a clear method. He makes you participate and his classes are light.,1
Professor Weaver is a great professor!  He cares about his students and always makes himself accessible for help.  The class is relatively simple if you put forth the effort.  I recommend taking him if possible!,1
"Maria-Luisa is a phenomenal teacher!! She properly explains grammar and is extremely knowledgable! You can text or email her anytime, she's the sweetest person ever! I definitely recommend her !!!!",1
Excellent professor.  Great lectures and a great person in general.,1
"Lisa Bullard is a wonderful teacher, Some of the comments from below that don't have much legitimate criticism may be from a few events awhile back. The ChE Department caught students cheating and they were punished, the point being if you're going into ChE don't come in if you're going to cheat. Professor Bullard is a great teacher and adviser.",1
"Class is 90% exam grades. Exams of which are incredibly difficult and almost impossible to do well on. This class wasn't even for my major, and I think I speak for most when I say anything remotely interesting that I could've learned in this course was ruined by her terrible teaching style. This class is such a disappointment because of this prof",0
That class was a Joke....easy class if you say everything he wants you to say or think about ethics....use your own brain or conviction and be prepared to fail the class....Just warning you just go along with the flow and you will be fine.,1
Great professor ! I would take her all 4 years if i could. Shes very understanding & gives great feedback on your papers. Shes always in a great mood & her grading criteria is CLEAR the whole semester.,1
Not the best. Lectures tend to be very disorganized and speaks at a very fast rate so it's impossible to write complete notes. Great person overall and is very funny but very little feedback is provided.,0
He tried so hard to keep us engaged and was comitted to our knowledge and helping local businesses. Such a great person and offers lots of extra credit to make sure his students dont have to stress about their grades,1
"Haberman is a good professor. You don't need to show up in class often and No quizzes in class. Only graded worksheet and finish it at home. He'll always be there when you have any questions. But, you have to prepare pretty well for 3 exams in a whole term.",1
"Often too much work expected out of the lab reports, although he makes bonus marks that you can take advantage of.",0
He does not teach. His notes don't explain anything and are written in the format of a horrible textbook. His exams are very hard and require derivations that no one in the class can complete.... which would be fine if they were anything we actually learned. Unorganized and one of the worst professors I've had in CHE,0
"he is terrible, stay away...",0
"Professor Kern is a lovely teacher! He is very caring and wants every one of his students to succeed. But plz note that doing your homework is mandatory and so is attending every class. But In conjunction with the in-class teaching, we used a program called Aleks which I found to be extremely helpful! I would for sure to have this professor again:)",1
"He's a nice guy but not a very good teacher, went to lectures during the beginning of the semester but stopped because they're confusing and often irrelevant to tests. You'll do far better in the class if you use the textbook and the assignments and lab manual questions he posts.",0
This class is one of the WORST classes i have ever been in. He is so monotone and boring and he jumps from place to place when hes talking so im not sure what exactly im suppose to know. He also seems to have an attitude when your coming in and out of class rolling his eyes. I would NOT take this class again if i ever had too!,0
"Prof. Thompson is a very cool teacher. Just read (skim) and bug him about giving you a study guide. Tests are a variety: M/C, T/F, short answer & short essay. Funny teacher. Would take again. Highly recommended.",1
I had her during the pandemic and she didn't even teach us. She posted recorded lectures from 2016 and more recently edited slides so they didn't even match up. We did not have a single meeting face to face. The only grades were 4 Tests. I did like the material that was taught just not the way it was taught. Take the class in person not online!!,0
"Knows his stuff, but he's definitely there to weed out underperformers",1
"Office hours are non-existent. He asks questions weirdly and vaguely.However, he tells you all the questions that are going to be on the test. If you show up to class, take good notes, and study what he specifically says, you are fine. I didn't read the book& got an  A.If you have a problem during a test, ask him and he'll help you with the answer.",0
"Very incompetent professor - does not give reasons for her grades given. When asked about grades for a course her response was merely, ""Don't worry, you're passing."" NEVER take her online course!!!!!!!!!",0
"Really great professor :) I absolutely HATED talking in front of people but Mr. Walker helped me overcome that very quickly! Pay attention in class and actually DO your work because he will definitely know if you're not trying. Take him if you are dreading Speech class, you'll soon really enjoy Speech with his guidance.",1
Mo is great. He loves jazz band and it definitely shows in his teaching style. All you need to do is attend all concerts and rehearsals and you will get an A. A great guy overall.,1
"Professor Debrot is an overall nice person but as a Professor, terrible. He really puts his all into his lectures but takes the class too seriously for a gen ed. If your test answers are not worded the way he prefers to see, the answer is automatically wrong. Class is also extremely boring. Mostly readings for homework. Seriously do not take it.",0
"Her classes were interesting, but she grades so hard. She hardly ever gives full credit for anything. I would never take this professor again. She is very strange. I ended up with an 89.5 and she would not round me up to an A.",0
"People may say she's very opinionated, but she's so sweet! She is very understanding and always willing to help. Few short papers but they're so easy and all she's looking for is your opinion. A lot of material on the test but if you really sit down the day before and study, you'll be absolutely fine. I got an A and she gives a lot of extra credit",1
Over complicates simple concepts. Takes months to post his lecture notes on the online platform. Unorganized.,0
This professor is very nice and quite amusing my problem is mainly that his syllabus is really unclear. This class is also utterly boring.,0
"Awesome professor! He's insanely helpful and understands exactly what you're going through as an undergrad and is willing to help you in anyway, in and out of the classroom. He's like a little kid at heart, which makes class interesting. Tests are easy if you pay attention, it's exactly like the homework.",1
Worst professor I have ever had at UB . I wish there were more professors teaching this course that are inspirational and encouraging to their students. If you take him be prepared to have a semester filled of stress and depression. It does not matter how much you try he will always find problems with your work and just wants more and more.,0
"This womans opinion is the ONLY opinion that matters to her. The more I BS-ed on the essays and reiterated EXACTLY what came out of her mouth in class - the higher grades I got, i'm not kidding. Easy class, but advice: Take notes during lectures and use things she says EXACTLY in your essays and you will get an A. No Conflicting Opinions Allowed!",0
"Man, this guy is no good. He kills your GPA. His knowledge is outdated. Very spiteful and mean.",0
Painful to listen to. avoid course if possible.,0
"Not a recommended teacher. Lectures contained too much content to cover in a single class or menial, repetitive exercises for the entire time block. Attendence is recorded by clicker. If you're looking for an easy A, this'll get the job done, but there are other much better classes for the same purpose.",0
"Heres the deal, Mr. Wanamaker was a nice guy, but its a good thing I found Psycology interesting on my own. There was zero outside communication and limited in class communication. His test questions were worded confusingly and are super specific. Hell turn one-time side comments into test questions. I wouldnt take a class from him again.",0
Can tell she was very knowledgeable on the subject but had to be one of my worst professors this semester. Gave piles of work but never gave feedback or grades until the 15th week (the grades). And the final was 7 pages long over a span of 5 days! In the middle of a pandemic?! Take another Professor if you care about yourself because its a mess.,0
"Dr. Chisholm is one of the best professors in the College of Ed at U of L. He not only teaches best practices but he models them as well. He is an advocate for giving and receiving feedback. When he gets feedback, he actually uses it to improve the course, imagine that! He is always available to meet with students outside of class. Great professor!",1
"Good class notes (except for myriad minor errors).  Also nice PowerPoints.  But she can't pronounce a single scientific word, and she's hard on people in class.  Stumbles in explanations.",0
"If you want to spend hours EFFECTIVELY learning about the Psychology of Personality, enroll in this class, buy the required textbook, and then withdraw. Tessier's attempt at teaching her online course reminded me of a dictionary that uses the word it defines as the definition, its overwhelmingly annoying and leaves you exactly where you started.",0
Dr. Shepard is very intelligent. She does a good job at going through the material thoroughly  and answering any questions that students have during and after class. She starts class off with a discussion and lets that lead the lecture in class making sure students are tied into the topic. Use the book for tests and quizzes.,1
My FAVORITE TEACHER EVER!! Very approachable. I would never have graduated without his help.,1
not the most interesting person but he has his funny moments to wake the class up.  tests aren't really hard but be very specific on the essay questions.,1
"Don't take this guy if you are someone that needs organization. Lectures are PPT presentations that are like 120-157 slides long and boring as hell. He lies about assignments like he'll say to 1 person that  paper should be 1 page, then a week later, he'll tell someone else its supposed to be 3 pages. no one knew their grade til last week. he's bad",0
"She is a really nice person if you're nice to her... she loved me but still graded me hard so if you think being friends with her is going to help you you're wrong!!! You just have to actually do the work, kind of a pain sometimes",0
Information overload is litteral here.,1
"He knows the language and etymology well and a lot about Germanic cultures, but it is difficult to do well in the course without any prior experience. Practically no homework and it is never taken up. He spends most of the class working through the exercises in the textbook. I do not recommend him. But he's not the worst either.",0
Trent is amazing and so are his Purdue jokes. Class was very enjoyable.!,1
"Dr Jamieson has a good heart, and is a nice man, but I did not feel that he had the qualifications to teach my course. Additionally, his lectures were virtually pointless and not supportive with the rest of the course. Most of the semester was taught by students(via presentations).",0
Dreadful class. Reading the books for this class is a must! I didn't and it screwed me over because trying to study for the tests is impossible without them. She stalls half the time in class and is terrible at telling you what the assignments are about . Avoid her at all costs!,0
"Lectures are just him talking, no powerpoints. Has you read a bunch of books for the cultural elements but then tests you on plot. Judkins is not a very involved prof. TA's run review and answer questions. I would try to take the class with other a different prof",0
"Professor Sanford is one of my favorite professors I've had. Lectures are entertaining and you get out early everyday. Only downfall is that exams are the only grades. So if you're not a good test taker, I don't suggest this class. Only requires you to buy a book of his notes that is $9 (twice) which is nice.",1
Worst class I took during degree.,1
An incredible experience taking Dr. Vermette's course. So much knowledge is shared and learned that you often feel his course was worth 20X more than the tuition cost. If you want to benefit from his knowledg read his books/publications. Thanks Vermette!,1
He is hard to follow in lecture. He uses a calculator to teach. ,0
"She made attendance mandatory but never actually taught course content. The only class discussions we ever had were in breakout rooms with other students. She also made her exams very difficult, and assigned a semester long group assignment worth 15% of the grade. This was hard to work around during a pandemic with kids in other time zones.",0
"I haven't been to school in almost 20 years, and I was able to understand what he was teaching.  Enter as an adult, ready to learn and he is willing to help, I'm sorry he won't be here to teach Math 96.  Its true he does require a lot to pass, yet its broken down and he's always willing to help.",1
The class was challenging at times but Julie really tried her hardest to make sure everybody understood what was going on. The workload was never overwhelming and too difficult. She is fair with grades and really wants to see you pass her class.,1
"WORST CLASS EVER TAKEN! This teacher gives NO feedback and does NOT respond to emails; he says to allow up to 5 DAYS to respond to an email?! He should not be allowed to get away with that for an online class. Very hard to communicate with. His assignments are confusing and not clear. I would never take him again, waste of money and time.",0
"I absolutely loved this class. Dr. Sears is extremely intelligent and really knows and loves what he is talking about. The class consists mostly of watching his online lectures and taking quizzes/exams. The exams are pretty hard, but everything is open note so it is definitely doable. I would highly recommend taking this class.",1
"I honestly don't understand how he got good reviews. He is a very tough grader who can be very rude and mean depending on his mood. His exam is 85% of the total grade and I was never able to finish them (I studied a lot). I never missed his class or hw and still got B-. Even I take the same class again, I don't think I'll be able to do better",0
"Don't be late, turn off your phone, raise you hand, pay attention, don't vacillate when called upon, and be prepared. Do that, and you'll be fine. Might be the funniest teacher I've ever had.",1
"He's a bit snooty and pretentious. He has sometimes discredited film as ""art"". The philosophy book you have to read is super confusing. He is also a bit extra for an assignment where you have to write four sentences (ie it's not even an essay or anything), we had to print it out as apparently handwritten is not good enough for him.",0
"Duncy D is honestly such a gem. Made me realize I didnt actually hate philosophy after the X part of my course, I just didnt like the teachers until him. Really engaging lectures and a funny guy who genuinely cares about students",1
"Loves to give a ton of work that teaches you absolutely nothing. Doesn't do a good job of explaining what he wants. Lectures are a complete waste of time, i'd recommend not going to them. Fortunately the course is very easy. You'll probably get at least a B if you hand in anything at all.",0
"This was a blended class so we met once a week and did the rest online. She had video lectures and power points for us.  She gave bonus work, homework and quizzes that you could retake until you get 100 on them. She even gave you 10 points on each exam that you do before text day and you can retake it until you get 100.  Tough class, good teacher.",1
overal very average teacher. bad things: throws on ALOT of movies and its really boring and puts people to sleep he expects u to learn off watching 100year old movies.Good things: final exam pretty straight forward and easy guy to get along with,0
Extremely unorganized and kind of rude. The assignments have no clear grading criteria so you kind of just get whatever grade he chooses for you with no valuable feedback to support it. There are other much better professors in the department who actually care about their students,0
He is a very nice guy who always gives study guides. Tests get harder each time but not too bad. You do have a read books and have weekly quizzes/tests. Movies are not in english most of the time but have subtitles. In my opinion because I am not a german major very boring,1
"I personally hate this class. The layout of the class makes no sense. The countries are scattered and the order is not related. He constantly talks about the ""Universal Pattern of Culture"" which is in no other academic source online or otherwise. The only source I have found that has anything similar contrasts his definitions completely.",0
this class rocks,1
"He is a great professor!His class is hilarious and fun. He is very passionate about theater and have a great sense of human that always make  students laugh. I loved him so much! I was actually slacking off my work, but then he helped me with many clarified key points in his office hours. Take him, he is great professor!!he sings chinese opra too!!",1
"Honestly, the class in it of itself shouldn't be hard, but Lephardt makes it hard. Her in class 'lectures' are pretty much incoherent rants, and she depends way too heavily on the book. She's also convinced that a C is a totally ok grade, so if you pull a C in her class, be happy I guess. AVOID IF YOU CAN",0
Disengaging due to lack of new or challenging content. Everything is regurgitated or paraphrased from texts. I have found other phil classes to be much better in terms of bringing students to a higher quality level of thinking and reasoning.,0
"The class is based purely on what is verbally said. There are no powerpoints or notes she uses. You come to class and you take notes on what she says. If you a miss day, you'll be lost and would have to get the terms from someone else since they are used on the tests. The final paper is a hassle. Coming to class is vital to your grade.",1
"Pashley is honestly the most annoying teacher I've had. Can't stand her weird voices or tangent stories that are painful to listen to, as she reads the power points day in and day out. Could be a gen ed, ""bonus if you come"" type class, but instead you have to go in and try not to doze off. Try to take someone else if possible.",0
"I was lost in that class most of the time. He assumed students knew things that he hadn't covered. The whole class was struggling, and when we asked questions he didn't answer them well. Kind human, but going to that class took a toll on my mental health more than any other class at Calvin has for me.",0
"Gillespie is the man. I'm not an accounting major so I thought this class was pretty easy compared to my other classes, but it seemed like the accounting majors had some trouble. He's a really good professor and his exams really test your understanding. If you study you study like 5 hours for his exam you will do just fine.",1
"This guy should really have a much higher grade on here. Really awesome, caring professor who is VERY interested in getting interdisciplinary students into Computer Science. Class is really easy, but you will learn A LOT if you pay attention in lecture and do the minimal reading. Favorite class this semester, could not recommend enough.",1
"Don't ever take this professor. He is boring, not helpful, and grades tests and assignments based on what his opinion is. This was probably my hardest class this semester, and I would never take a class by him again. He only has a midterm and a final, and gives no outline or guidelines for the presentation. Overall, I hated this class.",0
"Dr. Rivas is very approachable and friendly. He lends the authority of the classroom to the students, which of course has its positives and negatives. Take the class if you are looking for an easy ride through pointless theory. Honestly, Rivas would be more effective behind the scenes of the English department than teaching.",0
"Rossi was a pretty good professor. His test are hard and some of the homework is hard but go to every class and discussion. Go to his office hours, i went every week and he helped me everytime. However, go with specific questions about problems. Its calc you have to expected to do work",1
"I have him in multiple courses as im a classics student; hes the best teacher ive ever had in my entire life.  He is passionate, knows his subject, makes it very interesting, hes easy to follow and doesnt get lost in random nonsense blabla that nobody cares about. Not the easiest exams but hes very helpful and helps you to prepare.",1
Good professor. Breezes through lectures fast so you have to pay attention. He gives exam reviews which are super helpful. Just do the homework and give yourself time on the programming projects. Easy to get an A as long as you study and do the work.,1
"One of the most interesting classes I have taken at VU.  Great professor, wish I could take more classes with him!",1
Took the Creative Writing class with Professor Daniels. He explained everything in an easy-understanding way and related many things to real life. He's also very chill as a person. Wish I would have gotten more feedback though for my writing though.,1
"Tends to lecture on in class + he rarely shows a movie. Gives out pop quizzes to make sure you're reading the material. Gives out midterm + final papers as tests. He's a really awesome and energetic guy but not the best professor in the world. I wouldn't take another one of his classes, I felt I walked away with learning nothing new each day.",0
"Difficult course, good teacher.  She tries very hard to get her students to where they need to be.  Baer may have a better technique (at least for my) but she is equally nice and helpful.",1
Wow this prof. is the most boring and uninteresting teacher I have ever had imagined. His class is simple and straight forward. 60 pointless journals about whatever you read and discussions. 2 Midterms and a Final. Daily quizzing on reading material 10 pts per.,0
"He is very good in teaching Java. But, I would say only attend his class if you want to learn it in a more advanced environment. If you have no idea about programming, it's better you attend some other professor. Other than that, he is extremely helpful and passionate about subject. He might be bit disorganized but it did not affect me in anyway.",1
He is a good professor. He teaches well. He is helpful and a nice person. Some of his YouTube videos have terrible audio and he does not repost better versions.,1
"He has such a great reputation, but for what... He is straight up the worst professor i've had (I'm a senior). He basically just makes you do all the work and he doesn't really teach. He just runs through everything really fast. He assigns like 10-20 readings a week for a level 100 class. CHILL OUT. Great guy but a GOD AWFUL professor",0
"took online class - Timed Tests and discussions w/only two days to take and answer.Tests are 60 qt's and you are given a minute for each on over 4 - 5 chapters.  If you question him, he will call you out(Chastise more like) in class and threaten to kick you out. SO NOT HOT! Unprofessional is more like it. Papers are easy but outline is very long.",0
1960 was 45 years ago. Just a tip.,0
"cannot speak spanish well, needs to go to Spain for a year. very easy, nothing bothers him, how did he get this gig? how does he keep it? take any of his classes if you have a heavy course load and just want an A with no learning spanish",0
"Lectures can be boring but she does try to make it fun sometimes. If you don't participate in seminar she gets salty. LOTS OF READING. had her for 2P83 too, very similar. not very helpful when asked about essays/thesis construction & admits she isn't good at exam review. try to take other courses if you're an English major who needs the credits.",0
"Tests are super hard, but if you go to class and she knows your name, she will help you out. She's always willing to meet outside of class and explain things to you. Her accent can be tough to understand, but she is SO EXCITED about teaching multi. Her knowledge of math is like way beyond multi, so sometimes she forgets how to explain things simply",1
"Good prof. He curved everybody generously. His office hour is very helpful, he can explain everything clearly. Will take him again.",1
"I enjoyed his class. You will have to work and read, but this is a college class. I enjoyed him and have taken him for several classes. He will teach so you learn. There are times when he likes to hear himself talk, but it is an interesting class. I would tell others to take it.",1
Worst class ever.  I'd rather get hit by a car than take that class again...getting a headache just thinking about it.,0
Don't take this class. The teachers spends all the class reading what's on the powerpoint and his powerpoint is a copy and paste of the pages of the book. He also sends 2-3 different versions of the homework because they all needed some correcting and specifications. Be prepared to use Microsoft Excel for the homeworks.,0
"Not good for visual learners. No structure to class or lectures. Also, he yelled at me for returning a textbook one time. Angry guy.",0
"Terrible. Unclear lectures, exams too long, no sense for basic things like class prereqs/posting homework solutions before exams, talks too much about how simple the concepts are/how everyone should get them (several times/lecture). Homework was lectures ahead of us conceptually more than once. And all this was *before* classes went online.",0
"Hard to understand, unclear of whats on exam, he will ask ""what chapter are we on again?"" (very forgetful) not true to his word .. do not reccommend if you dont need it",0
"Awesome professor, just go to lectures",1
"All he did in class was read off of the slides, had no personal flair or interest in engaging students whatsoever. His ""study guides"" were just the section headers from the book, and his tests felt more like trivia games than actual testing of our knowledge. Also when we reached out to him, he was petty and rude. Would not recommend at all.",0
Lexa is great. Organizational communication was not my concentration area but she  opened my eyes to how corporate communication is structured. Assignments are relevant: four 3-4pg papers and a 15-20 pg. Lit review.  The only bad thing is that she can be a little late posting readings- that's tough for full time workers with limited free time.,1
"If you can avoid having him, DO IT. He is very, very unhelpful and rude.",0
"Kelly is the BEST! I love her, and I miss having classes with her. If you want to have an upbeat instructor who is fun and outgoing then take Kelly!",1
"Don't take him!! His lectures are hard to follow and he gets into some really technical finance theorems without any introduction. His tests are only 8-10 questions a piece and he isn't clear on what topics will appear. The textbook isn't much help either, since his test are usually over what he says in his lectures.",0
"I took this class thinking it would be easy and I was wrong. Valliere is a tough grader, and although incredibly blunt to where it can be borderline rude, he gives great feedback and is an amazing professor that will push you out of your comfort zone. It is clear that he is passionate about his work, and I could not recommend this professor more.",1
"Worst professor to take for upper level courses, obviously trying to prove something.  If you have to take this professor, truly question yourself.  Anyone that says otherwise has their head to far up and buried deep, you finish the rest,",0
"LOVE Dr. Wight. He teaches the material in a way to help you remember it, There are weekly quizzes, read the book to study. The tests are difficult but if you study and read the chapter you'll do fine.",1
Best in the college. Not a hard class. Pay attention to class.,1
she wants all her students to be plant biotechnologist which in all actuality most people are not she was very difficult to understand in her lectures and her grading is very unfair,0
"The questions are confusing, the reading material is absurd, and the professor is extremely hard on grading. If you don't answer one part of the 2 or 3 questions it shows drastically on your grade.  Don't take this professor unless you're prepared for a stressful class andor major headache.",0
"Despite the reputation, the class wasn't terrible. You have to work for a grade, but no more than in other classes. Just do the assignments each week, meet with TAs when you have questions, and find a study group. Prof Kearl is a phenomenal lecturer and thoroughly I enjoyed the class.",1
"Neglects to tell students about huge concepts until the review classes before the test.  Doesn't do anything but read from the slides. NO time in-class for students to do example problems and discuss, which is NECESSARY to understand math. Acts surprised and condescending when students aren't getting it.  DO NOT TAKE FINANCE WITH HIM.",0
"Hardest English teacher I've ever had! She gives feedback on rough drafts but even if you improve those areas you still end up getting something wrong. Even after going to ARC and being told that my papers were good, I still ended up getting bad grades on them. She was the last professor available, I should have taken 1202 with another professor!",0
I had a hard time in his lab cause I couldn't hear him at all in the back & since the physics dept doesn't follow the exact procedure on the manual you're usually trying to figure out how to do the lab yourself since you couldn't hear him. Communication issues since he may tell you to do one thing and your TA may take marks off for the same thing,0
Very nice professor. Will help you if you need anything. Tough information that he explains really well - so go to class and make your own notes in the sidelines of his slides so it's clear to you. Tests are based only on what he talks about in class (somewhat hard).  Suggest buying the book online through Aplia (he will explain that) saves MONEY!,1
DeMello is a great teacher. I was worried as he is from India but his accent is not distracting at all. Weekly assignments and only 3 tests the whole semester. He assigns homework for extra credit on the tests and gives a curve as well. Overall I would take a course with him again. ,1
"She knows a lot about this topic. I advise everyone to take this class due to the algorithms taught are real life stuff. Start coding early and ask her for explanations. She cannot write code well. It reminds me of a CS102 student. Besides that, cool class.",1
"Professor Hetrick is a nice enough and good teacher but he is not an easy ""A"" or ""B"". You have FOUR 5 Page Essays and a FINAL that's like a FIFTH Paper all graded on every possible rule of grammar. Like not enough or too many commas gets you minus 10 points! There are a couple of EASIER ENGLISH Professors there on campus so please find one!!!",1
"Birxy, 48 year veteran on campus. Understands Canisius politics and who to avoid. Grooms you to be in the same league as him, above every one else!",1
"Very, very funny. Knows a lot about his subject and makes class interesting. Lots of notes.",1
Professor Barnes is really nice and her class is easy. There is a lot of online quizzes but they were easy. She is not strict at all.,1
"Great teacher, very enthusiastic. Definitely the best teacher I had for the 20 series",1
"When it comes to teaching, he doesn't know how to do it. He may understand math himself, but the way that he teaches it leaves everyone utterly confused. I know that it wasn't just me that wasn't getting the material because the whole class was completely clueless every day. I had to teach myself all the material and spent hours learning it at home",0
"Wonder why this class has spots to fill, because he is bad. Had to drop the class after bombing 1st exam and Im an econ major. Class has nothing to do with anything, avoid Grubb",0
Mr. Prunty is an amazing professor! His teaching style is easy to follow and very straight forward! Loved everything about his class! Definitely want to take math from him again!,1
"i got a 100% in this class...i got 100s on everything in the class, ofc i studied and tried to understand the material. he is the collest prof ever",1
"On new graduate student orientation, professor McCoy as our chair gave an inspirational speech to welcome everyone. She has the vision of a real scientist, and her speech connects to my heart. I feel that I could be someone that really use my research to change the world. I want to thank her for extending my funding, a great caring professor.",1
"She is a good and thorough teacher but this class is so much WORK!! All the reading and homework and participation we need to do is too much for summer. She has too high expectations for a GEC, she needs to be more relaxed in classroom discussion. Not everyone has time to read everything and give answers! She helps outside class but intimidating.",1
"I've been at state for four years. JAY is the worst teacher I've ever had. He is narcissistic. His theories are unfounded and weak, but he believes he is the god of race philosophy. He does not allow you to think for yourself. His writing is repetitive and he talks in circles. If there's a counterpoint, he will simply leave it out or denounce it.",0
"IF YOU WANT TO PASS STATS, DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR. his tests are unreal, the projects take forever, multiple homework assignments every class, 4 tests PLUS midterm..doesnt explain material, just writes it on the board from the text. not willing to help either. avoid him!",0
"okay whoever said jeri is bad is an idiot. shes not the head of the art department for nothing people. shes compassionate, caring and ALWAYS makes time for people. she helped me get my art program up and running. im so happy MU has her, and shes the head of the department. great professor, great person.",1
"It is difficult to describe this course as anything but a failure. Nichol is a good guy, yes, keeps decent office hours, fair-ish on overdo assignments. The grading is ABSOLUTELY all over the place. You don't need the Gaskell book. You don't need to go to class. The Lectures MAKE NO SENSE. Ramblings.",0
"Does not use PowerPoint for lectures, insisting on using a projector where she writes on some paper. The problem is her handwriting is hard to read & depending on the lecture hall if you have a bad seat in class - you won't be able to read what's on the screen. Because of that you have to be listening carefully to her voice, which is very shrill.",0
"I liked Mr Martinez as a professor. He does take the class seriously, so if you're looking for an ""easy"" class, this might not be for you. If you have a passion for music, you will probably love the class, though. Tests are lengthy, but if you like the material, it shouldnt be a problem.",1
Great professor. Probably one of the best I've ever had. Tough grader but very helpful and always willing to meet you outside of class. There isn't formal participation grades but she will raise or lower your grade at her discretion depending on your participation. Highly recommend her if you want to learn a lot.,1
Dr. Yamazaki is one of the hardest but most amazing professors Ive ever taken! Although her tests and quizes can be brutal she trully cares about her students and prepares you for any professional program. Take her physiology courses if you want to learn and can handle a chanllenge.,1
Doesn't put in much effort.  Very boring.  No matter how much I try I can't pay attention or stay awake.,0
Very hard and extremely picky instructor. Student be aware!,0
"This class was easy for me because it was really just a review. I loved this class and her as a teacher. If you struggle with fractions and etc, she will definitely break it down it different ways to explain. She also responses quickly online. The only downfall is that she switches up a little and that you have to buy a ""online textbook"" to do hw.",1
"Her lectures go by so fast you don't know what she is saying. Test heavy for sure. She gives no extra credit at all. I am extremely good at math but she only grades her tests for the correct answer. She does not care about the process, only the final answer which sucks. I will probably fail this class and have to retake because I bombed the midterm",0
"Has a very hard time speaking in continuous sentences, very broken and repeated, but once you get past that he really knows his stuff and will help you out. Solid calc professor.",1
intro to geology class was really boring. i never fall asleep in class except i almost did in hers. shes really nice tho. she makes it easy to pass the class with a decent grade. pyramid style exams help your grade. didnt need alot of outside studying,1
"When signing up for this class I was thinking it would be neat and fun, it was the opposite. Dave and Hart did a terrible job communicating with the students and grading work. They couldn't explain the concepts in a whole as class timing and organizing was an issue. I would highly recommend to avoid courses with Hart and Dave Hooper.",0
"Had for English comp. Alot of homework.  Doesn't teach much in class. All homework and then saying how we did it, but she doesn't explain much.",0
I found this class to be really interesting because I know some of the things we learned about I will see/experience in the future with jobs. Professor Clark on the other hand is kind of scatter-brained and when you would ask him questions about his class he never could really give you a straight answer.,1
"not super helpful towards of the end, and information is not entirely clear, especially questions on exams",0
"Text is an easy read, esp. for people not fluent in lawyer speak. Discussions are 2-3 questions per week, easy if you do the reading. Mid-term & Final are indepth, multi, T/F, essay. Prof is SUPER helpful and stays on top of everything. Would recommend him.",1
"Dr. Callaway is an energetic, engaging professor, and her class was an amazing experience! She was helpful, if a little vague, outside of class, and her paper-comments were honest and helpful. Tough grader on papers, but her focus on participation should boost any ""off"" grades.",1
This class was awful for an online class. Lots of assignments and discussions that took weeks to grade. Lots of them were assignments that provided little to no help in actually learning the content. Felt relatively hard for a non biology major class.,0
"I really enjoyed this class. This professor makes the material interesting. He breaks everything down to make the information easier to understand. He also draws diagrams and pictures, which really helped me remember the material. Not a lot of homework. Just pay attention and take really good notes.",1
"She doesn't record classes or post lecture slides, you only get notes summarized by students that aren't always posted. If you don't go to class you won't know a lot of what's going to be on the tests because she talks A LOT during lectures. Her feedback on assignments is pretty useless and doesn't actually help you improve on your written work.",0
"AVOID THIS GUY AT ALL POSSIBLE!. His test are nothing like that homework, which by the way he couldnt even do half the time. The Bradley Phyics dept. is very good but whatever you do, dont take capozzi. He is a really cool guy but the worst teacher i have ever had in my life. take my advice.",0
"He made a 200-level class insanely more difficult than it should have been. Attendance was not mandatory but he expects you take impossible notes during his 2-hour ramblings about the most dry topics ever. I think an average exam grade was about 60% usually. I received a C and I was lucky. I would highly recommend avoiding him. If not, god speed.",0
"Very unorganized and unclear on directions, standards, and anything in between. Class was fairly easy, but putting up with her was not.",0
"Not a bad prof, keeps things light hearted. There are formal labs due every other week and it's extremely time consuming. He is an extremely hard grader, the math is easy but on the writing (and there is a ton) he grades hard and very picky. I took and aced Calc1 in high school but the in an issue w credits I took this class again-it was still hard",1
Dr. Roberts is a very inattentive professor. He does not teach the material. You will self learn by reading the book. His slides are direct copies of the book and he is not helpful in the learning process at all.,0
"I never had class with Professor Taylor but am a little peeved that he got my favorite professor, Kush K. Bhardwaj fired many years back for political reasons.  He was jealous and upset that a man of Egyptian descent was teaching African American history.  Long live Professor B who is still doing good things in Buffalo.",1
"Her class is extremely hard, make sure to take the lab it's worth 40% of your final grade and is an easy A. To pass her exams, you really need to pay more attention to what she says in class, not just the book and they're not about memorizing the material, it's about a general knowledge of it, so you really have to be committed to studying",0
This dude called out multiple of us this semester for plagairism which is the one thing I have never done during my college career. I took this class for fun and I'm going to end up failing. He's a very tough grader. There's only four grades and the final is a ten page paper.,0
hmm,0
"He is a nice guy and very approachable. His tests were not that esay. It consisted of long answer and map type questions. He used the book often. A lot of homework. You have to do 3 essays. Attendance is a must, he calls it out at the end. He was the previous chairperson for CORE so you can imagine he was not that lenient. I wouldnt take him again.",0
"He can be really irritating... expects us to write three complex and fully developed essays AND MEMORIZE THEM to write for our final... oh, and he only gives us three days to do it all...",0
"Tisha Irwin has been a great inspiration to me. Before I thought a being a professor would be hard, but after experiencing this class, this isn't the case.  All I have to do is lecture for 20 minutes, give out 2 pieces of paper and sit at my  4 2 hours computer. There's no point in answering any question. All i have to do is be rude and condasendng",0
She is the easiest teacher ever. she provides many opportunities to get extra credit and the only tests given are the mid term and final. she also pretty much lets u turn in ur hw whenever.,1
Harder than expected. Lots of material covered on tests.,0
"not sure why Professor Tavvs gets great reviews for his lectures.  He is a very sweet guy but his lectures were not for me.  If you see on his syllabus, his notes are very in depth with a lot of problems that are not necessary  (70+ pages).  Tavss does put in a lot of effort and do his practice probs! I Prefer Guerra or Kimmel.",0
"I loved Professor Allen, but this class definitely isn't for everybody. To do well, you need to attend every class and pay close attention. Professor Allen's lectures are very interesting if you actually want to challenge your mind.",1
"What bothered me from day 1 is she's a Micro phD teaching nutrition. Lectures are long and boring. Any time someone asks a question she can't clarify or says ""I don't know."" Nutrition is not a hard course but her tests did not ask questions clearly which made them difficult. Besides that she is nice & i'm sure a lot better @ teaching micro.",0
"His lectures aren't bad and he seems approachable. Here are a few issues about this prof: this semester has been switched to online and he NEVER, and I mean NEVER responds to any students' e-mails. This is horrible as if we need ANY extra help, we have to e-mail him (either to get a response or to book a virtual meeting).",0
Awesome professor.,1
"Condescending. Doesn't answer emails, if he does it's up to a week later. Grades SO LATE. Most unorganized prof I've ever encountered. Boring and unprofessional. Every SINGLE week students had to remind him to post a quiz, or a reading or an entire module. Don't know why he became a professor, he clearly does NOT care about his students. HARD PASS.",0
Gaffney's class was a lot of work and often times what we were doing was very difficult to understand however he did a great job in lecture in explaining things so that we would eventually understand him. You do a lot of work but its worth it in the end because the other classes have a much harder time with the final.,1
"He drew a large crowd, but I think a big part of it was his fun anecdotal style. His actual teaching though..I didn't find that great and wasn't getting much out of class.I stopped attending early but did well by reading a friend's notes and ass't sol'ns. His quizzes/exam are relatively ez if u just go through notes/sol'ns well.",0
"No one can understand Bosco and his little ""tricks"". His favorite method of solving complex circuits is by inspection. Our T.A. was amazing  though and the exam was fairly simple. Lectures were useful if you could keep up, don't bother attending if you can't.",0
"I took this class for summer B during COVID. Professor Cash was very nice and accessible. He gives a lots of reading so if you like to read you will probably do good. I would definitely choose him as a professor again although it was very stressful at times. Overall, if you do well with reading comprehension quizzes and writing you should do well.",1
Too much emphasis on group projects. Unclear presentations. Power point after power point.,0
"Hands down the worst professor I've ever had. He talks a big game and tries to sound smart by using a lot of random vocabulary but it just makes him sound like a jerk. He is so abstract and the criteria of the class is so unclear so you never know what you're doing. He is not willing to help his students, and just belittles you when you ask! 0/10",0
"Claims he teaches you to think independently. Dont believe it! He only cares about what he thinks. If you treat him like a guru and agree with his politics, he loves you. If not he blows you off. Very disillusioning to have a philosophy professor who is so close-minded.",0
"Worst professor I've ever had! She is unorganized, very prejudice, boring, and thinks her beliefs are the ultimate answertruth. It's ironic how she is supposed to be teaching an ethics course, but does not practice personal moral behavior. Also, DO NOT BUY THE BOOK. All of the readings can be found online in some capacity.",0
"Not the most difficult class in the world, but tough grader on papers. Show up on time and stay for the whole class to get the most out of everything. Read the materials that she puts online and you should do well. SHE WILL MAKE YOU A BETTER WRITER. Two tests and three papers. Paper topics are very interesting! Highly recommend",1
"No attendance required, no books, no quizzes, no in class exams. Your WHOLE grade is based on your completion of Network Pro cert. No point in going to class he reads word for word off the slides and doesn't share any life experiences with you at all. I went to about 4 classes and got an A. Final is online and taken outside of class.",0
"Extremely knowledgeable!
 Difficult assignments and I hear the exams is even worst.",1
"design is my life, and it was nearly crushed to death from this man. when i turned in assignments, he would only say how much he hates it. never explains why or what could be changed to make it better. also, when students ask questions, instead of answering them, he says things like ""stop complaining"". many students had a rough time in this class.",0
"Way too much homework, very tough grader, do not recommend.",1
Professor Savage's teaching methods are out of date and his exams and unreasonable. He uses public humiliation in class as a tactic to get students to work harder and it appears to boost his ego when students struggle in his class. Expect zero help outside of class. The only possible way to pass this course is to review past midterms and finals.,0
she is amazing.  great vocabulary that she doesn't dumb down.  treats people kindly & fairly.  great class- extremely interesting material,1
Please do not take with him. he is the worst ever and ever. He does not know how to teach. he just copy powerpoint from another professor and show in the class. he does not even know whats in the powerpoint because that was other professor slide. worst worst worst. you will regrett after middle of the class. do not take with him.,0
"Really great professor! He makes physics sound interesting. His lectures are super clear and he always goes over each problem patiently, even if most people get it right. He cares about students. Im really sad he wont be teaching 123 next quarter, I wish I could take it with him",1
He teaches you nothing but curves exams heavily. Expect to teach yourself chemistry (which is a hard subject),0
"Most hilarious professor I have ever had. He makes class enjoyable and fun. All you have to do is take notes every class, do 5 easy homeworks, and 3 non cumulative exams. He is so down to Earth and chill. Must take his class.",1
"She is a very nice teacher, does not put up with rude behavior. Her class was tough, I personally do not recommend her. Majority of the class failed, go to main campus more options. She makes you work in groups a lot. Try your best to keep up and get your book as soon as possible. Midterm  take home, Final  take home or in class(less questions)",0
She is a really tough grader and oftentimes her feedback isn't that helpful. Shouldn't be teaching freshman.,1
"Really easy A. Clicker required (for attendance mainly). Lectures are long and boring, minus a few interesting parts. Thorough in his work & powerpoints. You watch movies/documentaries half the time then quizzed on them with clickers in class. Practically the same online. Test/Quizzes online, goes over answers in  class, open to discussions.",1
Knows his stuff. Is extremely helpful. Fun class if you pay attention and listen (not goof off).,1
One of my flavorite teachers,1
"Dr. Ptak is an awesome but hard lecturer, That being said as long as you do well and ask for help you will do fine.",1
"She seems nice and like a good professor throughout the semester, but she will GRILL you for the final project. You can work as hard as possible and still be lucky to get a C. You're graded on several exams, two presentations, and participation (including showing up to class).",0
"Pretty good professor. Lectures are clear and and she explains concepts pretty well, at a good pace. Concept heavy class, only one programming assignment. Exams are fair and heavily based on the HW and slides.",1
"Probably the worst professor I have had at Hampden-Sydney.   He teaches introductory coarses as if they are graduate coarses.  If he is in a bad mood wile grading your paper, you will make a D-, but if he is in a good mood, you'll make a D+.   That class sucks.",0
"If you signed up for Pynns RS class for a challenge, you got one. He makes the course material interesting but hard to learn and keep up with. The tests are 5 strict essay questions long and the lecture itself doesnt even come close to covering enough material for them. Unless you are a Religious Studies major, your money is best spent elsewhere.",0
"She makes this class really hard, but if you ask for help outside of class it will help. She moves too quickly through material, her accent makes her hard to understand, and she doesn't answer questions in class well. There are graded clicker questions each class. There is a semester long group project. Definitely suggest going to office hours.",0
"The content he has to teach is very difficult, and he doesn't make it any easier by assigning tons of mandatory homework every week. He does not engage class, in fact he hates when he has to stop the class to answer questions. Very difficult to approach outside of class. Exams are very difficult, know what you're doing and study hard, don't slack.",0
"Explains clearly and is great with answering questions too. Professional. Straightforward assignments. Likes class discussion/shared opinions. One group project for the class (very simple). Online work can be slightly tricky, but slides/notes help. A bit awkward, but pleasant. A great teacher, period.",1
"Absolutely horrible teacher, worst I have ever had in my life I dreaded going to her class every day. She grades the first two pages of an essay and then doesn't read the rest if she doesn't like what she has read. Also on the day any major essay is due no matter the excuse she will mark you down 10 percent on the essay if you are a minute late.",0
"Prof. Bloem expects all of your time to be dedicated to her class. Her expectations are never clear, and although she can come off as a sweet lady, she really seems so scattered she doesn't know who you are in the end. Pick someone else for this course if you don't want to read around 12 novels for one class.",0
"I loved this teacher. He taught us the reason behind our math problems. This class challenged me and it was the best A I had ever earned. You are in college, it's nothing wrong with a little challenge. This class is lecture- based and does require you to figure out things, but Dr. Reiter was open to helping students who were motivated to learn.",1
"I had a mixed experience with Prof Rubin. The labs are clear cut and easy to do, but the final exam was a mess. There's no real study prep and questions were given that we did NOT cover. She is very dated and gives advice no longer relevant. Avoid this prof, and if you get stuck w/her, be sure to do an HONEST AND DETAILED evaluation.",0
i can see why people thought he was so difficult. def a tough teacher who is ultra specific. get the book. study the hell out of the chapters and you will do well on his quizzes but the final requires like twenty hours of review lol,0
"LOVE PROF AL-MALLAH. Probably my favorite professor by far. Lots of reading and participation and the tests aren't easy, but it's an enjoyable class and he's the cutest. Trying to find another class to take just to have him again!! :)",1
"Mr. Marsh is very excited about teaching anything science related.  He is helpful with researching answers to questions, but does not like having his views discussed beyond what he offers.  If you read the book and the lecture notes, it should be an easy A.  He is fair with his grading, although he does use tricky wording and phrasing in his tests.",1
"veru tough professor,at the same time she does not have the gift for teaching. avoid her.",0
"MBA class, foundation. Lots of busy work for 3 days or a week, lots of reading, articles from Harvard Business, basically preps you for school, helps you identify your goals for your MBA, gets you ready for school. Awesome person to talk to, caring, provides feedback, and guides you in the right direction, knowledgable.",1
"Dr Rogers is my favourite professor at Concordia. She is a brilliant prof whom not only gives you a solid understanding of Chemistry topics, but makes them land in a way that pertains to real life; not just a calculation on some exam. She is legendary!",1
Knows a lot about the class material and is really helpful. Sit in the front and you will hear him fine. Easy A and great professor.,1
"Temple expects students to know really difficult proofs. He can't explain anything to save his life, and his class is awfully managed. He says he's going to cover one thing in the syllabus, and ignores his plan in lecture. In discussions, TAs cover completely unrelated material. This is why professors should not have tenure.",0
"Professor Heath is the man! Had him last quarter for the first half of my C&I (Gods and Mortals) and he was great. Really knowledgable, gives fair, reasonable assignments and is also one of the funniest teachers/professors I've had.",1
"Dr. Plantinga is my favorite professor at Calvin - and I didn't think I was going to like his class at all. His lectures are extremely engaging and I look forward to his Bible jokes that he tells at the beginning of class. You need to know the materials well in order to do well on the tests, but the lectures follow the book very closely.",1
Great lady. Her accent is different. But once you get used to it she teaches wonderfully and interestingly.,1
its hard to understand his accent but you get used to it after a couple of classes. his exams are fair and he does not try to trick you. assignments are pretty easy!,1
Pawkett makes it really easy to learn some very hard stuff about the guitar.  His class was awesome and the fact that he is hilarious makes it all the more reason to take his class.,1
"If you want a job in journalism, take this class and talk with Marty regularly.  She will teach you the things you need to know to succeed as a journalist...and she will work her butt off if you are one of her best students and show a real effort.",1
"Stephenson is very hard to understand when teaching, she tends to rush and her familiarity with technology is not too hot. She is a very nice lady and cares about her students, but she gave a quiz every class and expected us to learn all of the material outside of class.",0
"He is one of the few good professors,I have had the privilege,to have taken at this University. He is extremely passionate about his field of study. When I saw he was British, I knew he would be great!",1
TBH she's a nice person but she isn't a great teacher. The class itself was pretty easy but that's because I learned by myself and went to study sessions with my classmates . Thank god that she didn't require us to go to class. Her class is a waste of time and you will not learn sh#$. Take someone else if you want to actually learn in finance .,1
"Young is an amazing math teacher. She makes everything so easy and straight to the point! She offers multiple opportunities to get your grade to the grade that you want in the class! If you have to take Math211, I wouldnt recommend any other teacher besides her",1
"Most interesting class I've ever taken, but also one of the hardest.  Professor comes off as very scary/tough, but if he likes you and you participate a lot then you won't have a problem.  Although there are no tests, the papers you have to write are intense and he grades hard. Participation is absolutely mandatory!",1
"He refuses to help anyone and criticizes those who have not had a math class in years. You better brush up on everything. I was told this was going to be a good math class since I haven't had one in 8 years and next thing I know he is showing Trig and Calc. I asked for assistance a few times during and after class, all he does is laugh at you.",0
"Class is way too dark, exams are very difficult, she puts things on the exam that are not in the book or her objectives. She also gives 80 page powerpoints that have nothing to do with the exams. She talks a lot and most of the time its about things that are not on the exam, and it takes her 3 days to get through one PowerPoint.",0
"I love Dr. Pierce! I took her for Public Speaking and she was incredible. She has clear grading criteria, which is nice. I got an A on every speech. Pay attention to her guidelines and you'll be fine. She even lets you email her your speech before you give it to the class, so she can give you corrections on what she's looking for.",1
"dysgraphia is certain, quizzes every class, no phones to take picture of board even though class is 50 minutes long, doesn't explain content and rude.",0
Kind of boring. She's a nice lady but a BLAH teacher. Didn't really learn much when I took it.,0
Lemenager knows how to grab the attention of his students for lectures. The study guides he gives  test. You are required to write 10 pages of collegiate writing for his class but he breaks it down into 2 papers 5 pages each. He gives extra credit every once in a while so make sure you take advantage of the extra credit.,1
"Dr. Elsheimer is a perfectly fine lecturer, you can see he loves chemistry and he tries to help you understand what is happening. If you have a lot on your plate (clubs, work, etc) and therefore do not put in the work such as reading and doing quizzes ahead of time, you are destined to fail. Test every 2 weeks, don't let your first grade fool you.",1
"He knows what he is talking about when it comes to accounting, but he doesn't do a very good job of making sure the students know. He grades homework only on participation so you have no idea if you're doing it right, and it's hours of work that's only worth 3 points. He got lazier and the class eventually was just a waste of time towards the end.",0
"The first half of the semester is somewhat organized but the second half is all over the place. Exams consist of 1-2 multiple choice questions and the rest is short answer questions. If you love politics, you might do well! Listen to his lectures and take notes! For the exams, study your notes and the deck (don't buy the course pack). ",0
Gerd is awesome. Always keeps you interested while you learn tons. He keeps every lesson online and his projects are innovative.,1
"A huge wieny. She made my life miserable. Her class policies suck and she is not understanding at all. I hated attending class and she barely even taught anything. She was rude, ignorant and did not even offer to help when my grade was failing. Never take her. It will be the worst decision you have ever made",0
"I enjoyed Prof. Moss class very much. I feel like there isn't that much work, but you do need to do well on the exams. There is a group project that's due by the end of the semester, which is really fun as long as you have the right people in your group! I would take her class again.",1
he is the man,1
"She was good, but I found that she inserted her own opinions too often.",1
"Huey is perhaps the greatest professor that I have ever had the privilege of learning from. His lectures are informational, thought-provoking, and often entertaining. Work load is very forgiving and exams are open-note. You can tell that Professor Huey really cares about his job and his students.",1
"Shows up 5 minutes before every class unprepared, expects class to stay 10 minutes after because she talks too long, racist and sexist teacher. Would not recommend",0
"Scott was fantastic, he reminded me of Rick Steves from PBS. Incredibly interesting lectures, great speaker, and a very clear/fair grader. Make sure you take notes, do your reading, and don't forget about his blackboard assignments, and you'll be fine.",1
"Was probably born with a silver spoon in his mouth. Arrogant. Talks down. He's a philosophy professor, but if you go four years at UVic in the Philosophy department without hearing about his association with the Law school a million times, you deserve some sort of medal.",0
I'm an A+ student and barely passed this class. He changed the weighting of our midterm to be worth more after the class average was 51%. Marking was 50M/50F. His slides focus on content that isn't tested and convolute the content you need to know. The only reason I passed is because he posted previous exams. He is unsympathetic and a harsh marker.,0
"He makes you do the homework before he even teaches the subject, so that's really difficult. He also has no examples on his powerpoint slides, it's almost as if he thinks you already have taken an accounting class. This is pretty much a teach yourself class, and it's not an easy class to try and learn on your own.",0
"Not a good prof. His lectures are decent, taking notes isn't like other classes. The first assignment is to write a recipe you like and why, how can anyone could possibly get a bad mark? Final exam has really badly worded questions and answers, will throw you off completely. Easier to contact aliens via email, also doesn't post grades online.",0
He wasn't a good lecturer. He loves to nitpick marks on midterms/finals. If you ask for a remark you will never get it. Avoid!,0
Professor Nobiletti is very passionate about American history. He brings in current events and films into the class. He has a lot of energy and is very inspiring. This is not the boring history class you took in high school. Be prepared to see the past in a new an interesting way. You will learn about cultural history.,1
"Marc is a very nice guy don't get me wrong, but I took him for geography and physical science. The test are mad hard and the study guides do not help. Half of the stuff on the test aren't even on the study guide.",0
Took this class during the summer online. Didn't require much of my time. Just be sure to start essays early. I found the essays to be the only difficult portion of this class.,0
"Professor Lazebnik is kind but very demanding. Homework every class, weekly quizzes, 3 exams, and a final. Homework isn't graded, but quiz/exam/final questions come from homework or are very similar in practice. Replaces lowest exam grade w/ final grade if it's higher. Partial credit if you can approach a question, and lenient with small mistakes.",1
"Gives you a chance to retake one test each semester. I had him for math 0700 my freshman year, and luckily I am taking him this semester for finite again. He is a little goofy, but the best math teacher I have had at AUM. Also, you don't need to purchase a book because all his material is on his website.",1
"He's a good professor and knows his stuff. He's also kind of funny, in an awkward type of way. Plus he trips over things occasionally. I don't know why that's important, but it was funny. THE EXAMS ARE SUPER HARD. He grades so specifically, and I studied really hard and still only ended up with a C. He's cool though, really nerdy about geology.",1
"When you stress the book is mandatory for part of your grade, it helps for the book to be helpful for that part of your grade. When a third of the class don't know when things are due, it might not be the students. Even if it is, then complaining about your students in class is not helpful. Emotional unilateral nuclear genocidal ethics rants here.",0
Kurt is a wonderful professor ever I had in my life. He gives a good amount of extra credit opportunities. He grades pretty fast. I love the way he teaches. office hours are best time for more help.,1
"If you can switch classes, then do. If you cant find a tutor! His teaching style is so hard to follow that I have to teach myself all the stuff. We usually have to correct his mistakes at least once per class. One thing if you have him-Do the homework. Its not mandatory, but hell be more likely to give partial credit on tests if you do it.",0
"4 exams, optional final IF the overall class average sucks. Yeah, it wasn't optional at first. Like everybody has mentioned, the class is harder than what it should be. Don't bother with the ppts, just read the textbook and memorize EVERYTHING cause he uses detailed questions like ""What's the third step of this?"" Attendance is MANDATORY. Goodluck!",1
"This class was horrible. His lectures are confusing and unorganized, and you have to put so much work in outside of class to even have a small chance of success. 0/10 would recommend. Success is possible but at the cost of your sanity.",0
"The course pack is interesting but her lectures are disorganized, she interrupts students, she doesn't clearly tie together readings+films+lectures and despite the class goal of countering eurocentrism she kinda falls into that trap sometimes.",1
She start confusing me after a few classes.,0
"Worst Teacher ever, her class is mainly a lecture class. She is very fast pace through her lectures and doesn't like it when you ask question during her lectures. she starts to get really annoyed and rude if there are lots of question and has to spend a little extra time on something to further explain.",0
"This class is extremely useless.  Joe Chen has great experience, but can't relate to students. Hard to understand most of the time.  Very nice guy, but this class should be done away with.  You will literally learn nothing.",0
"Mrs. Reeves made accounting a breeze even though I am NOT good at math! She is SOOO helpful and will take time to make sure you know the material. I had her for RETL 261 as well and because of her, accounting was one of my favorite classes this past year. Awesome lady and if you put in the effort you can make an A. Only opened the textbook twice.",1
"She is a very nice teacher and is pretty quirky. Tough grader on the first speech, but if you follow her advice given back to you, you should do fine.",1
"Great Teacher , extremly helpful, orgainzed and harmonous. You pay tuition to learn from somone not to read it out of a book and he does just that.",1
She is soooo hot! Take this professor! She is very helpful outside of the classroom!,1
"Professor Richards is seriously so smart. He makes lecture so fun and interesting, I always want to come to class. I don't have the book and I've been succeeding just fine, but I'm sure I'd do better with it. You don't necessarily need to go to class, but it's recommended and like I said, it's a good class! Would take him 100 times!!",1
"Dan was my favorite professor this semester, and I definitely recommend taking his class! He's really laid-back, and you can tell he loves what he does. As long as you participate and make sure to study the content, you'll be fine. This class was actually a stress-reliever for me most of the time and I looked forward to the lectures.",1
"The class was easy in terms of a grade. I ended with an A, but every day I basically wanted to fall asleep. He means well but just goes on and on about nothing relative to the subject at hand. Didn't teach, just spoke about his opinions.",0
"Once you grow accustomed to his thick accent, his lectures become engaging and humourous. He explains the subject matter in a thorough manner. His slides are extremely helpful; they explain everything step by step, so you don't need the textbook. He posts problem sets with complete solutions. His style is best suited for ""neurodivergent"" students.",1
lectures are definately off topic. asks way too much of the students. doesn't direct project well at all. too ambiguous. he has his favorites picked out.,0
"Great professor! Really cares about each and every student and tries his best to make every student succeed in his class. His exams are very fair, and if you study you should get an A at the least, and if you do not study, you will get a C or less.",1
"His lectures are confusing if you are new to this (non-EE student here) and are full of jargon. Says that ""it's not a programming class"", but you definitely need some coding experience. Go in during his office hours, he is much more helpful and also very friendly. Gave us the option to skip the final (he'd take an average of the first two tests).",1
"Pretty chill guy. Explains everything whether you're paying attention or not, and always answers your questions, if any. Smiles a lot, so in all he's nice :)",1
"He says you need the textbook, but he grades mostly based on his lectures. He gave a pop quiz the first week and almost everyone failed, but it wasn't graded. Grades are based on tests and a short paper about a political meeting you attend (of your choice). You can write another paper for extra credit. His lectures may be the best I've ever heard.",1
I did not learn anything in this class. If theology is your major run. This class was hard for only being a core credit. He is a tough grader with no rewrites. He gives a paper and a final so prepare.,0
I can confirm an earlier review of how Professor Sims uses a ruler to check the margins of your essays. I was baffled but every Professor is different. I took Professor Sims at CSUCI for a weekly class and overall enjoyed the class. Her workload can be hectic but she made learning about Shakespearean plays and sonnets fun.,1
He assigns too much reading  which is too difficult anyway. Trys to talk to students on a high conceptual level when they haven't read the material.,0
"I loved her. She is a little out there, but she repeats things sevral times with handouts that help when studying. The workload isn't too rough, but there is a lot on test. I had her for psyc 120 the sensation class. Spends more times on eyes than anything. But I recommend taking a class from her.",1
Professor Shearer is awesome! He excelled at moving to virtual teaching and leads really interesting lectures. The reading is also pretty interesting and easy to follow and definitely helps in keeping up with class lectures/essay assignments. There are only 3 essay assignments and he is a fair grader.,1
"Absolutely my least favorite professor at St Mikes. Without a doubt, he is very smart and really knows his area of expertise, but he speaks in a monotone condescending voice and often brushes off student comments. Timed quizzes were unreasonably hard and when our class voiced our difficulties he promised to ""take a look"" but never did a thing.",0
"Shulman is clearly an active member of the professional society, but he often rambles about unimportant things and clearly engages in favoritism. Like, blatantly. He can be very accommodating and receptive to complaints about test structure, but I find him mildly condescending. He is a person who wants to be fun, which is nice.",0
Prof. Willard is an awesome professor. Hilarious in his lectures and is really motivating. He made Linear Algebra very easy to understand and explains concepts very well. I'd love to have him again for a future course.,1
"Don't miss a class or assignment or he will embarass you. The only reason I took his class is because it's only offered in Spring and was a required course. Go to another school if you need to take any of his classes! I'm an A, A- student and somehow received a C in his class. Take his class if you want to mess up your GPA.",0
had him for 201. it sucked. especially for a class that you're only taking to get your art credit out of the way. multiple chapters of homework due every Sunday.,0
"Was a nice teacher at first and had a different way of teaching that I respected because not many professors are willing to try something new to help students succeed. However this style of teaching just did not work for me, and after expressing these concerns I guess I triggered him into writing a 5 page paper about how I was a terrible person.",0
"Felt very mislead, she came in saying her class was an easy A so I decided to stick with it.  Forget learning anything in class, you and your partner spend half the time learning the directions and rarely get to finish the activity before you're expected to answer aloud.  Worst parts are exams and she doesn't realize it's 101.  Not enough English",0
She is awful. I took her for Soc201 and there was one test worth 49% of the grade. She takes forever to respond to emails and is not understanding at all even if youre a good student. She overcomplicates concepts and moves really fast in class. She does not care if students succeed. Do not take her class if you can help it.,0
"horibble teacher. too smart to explain the subject to students. knows it very well, just cant teach. accused me of cheating on an exam because he didnt believe that he graded it wrong and thought i wrote the work in after the exam was handed back.  lots of matlab work, which is not thoroughly explained",1
"As a word of advice do not take Mrs. Wang's summer Calc course unless you are currently an 'A' student in Pre-calc. Perfect attendance, good grades on homework and class participation  0 if you do not nail the tests. Earnest effort 0. The test scores are the only thing that matters. If you are not comfortable taking difficult tests-drop.",0
"Extremely boring lectures. He would just read his slides, make some sound effects, and attempt to joke. He's a terrible grader, as even correct answers, with the same info from his slides, is marked wrong. Never replied to emails, hard to reach in general. Told us to study notes during the quarantine and then disappeared. Not worth paying $2k+ for.",0
"Looking at other reviews she seemed to be a good prof for short term classes, but for a semester class she was terrible. Class was a waste of time seeing as how she repeated what the txtbk said. You HAD to read txtbk for quizzes, 2 a week. Class was boring but she took attendance so you can't skip much. Hard tests, and unclear directions on paper.",0
"I took this class to fulfill my GE requirements. Professor Cliffes lecture videos werent extremely long, definitely not boring and had a great sense of humor. He was very understanding about rescheduling my mid terms, provides good feedback and is by far my favorite professor at grossmont!",1
"he's very helpful, and a very nice guy, but his lectures go very deep very quick",1
"Professor Ortmann is very understanding and sweet. The book is only used for in-class analysis, so make sure to bring it to class. She provides word lists to study that will be on the tests, as well as the essay questions. A very easy and informative class if you attend regularly and participate.",1
WORST professor ever. kicked me out of class on the first day for being 4 minutes late. doesnt deserve his job.,0
"Bob Logan, in short he likes to be called Bob. He is a very good prof, it is very easy to underestimate him. His level of grading depends on you. If you clearly understand his concepts and are capable of relating such you will do good. You will excel if you take advantage of office hours, he is encouraging and wants his students to succeed,",1
Ana is my favorite prof at Chapman!! She assigns the necessary homework and really cares about her students. She is so sweet and has a happy disposition every day. I learned quite a bit from her class. Make sure to take her class because she is an absolute gem. It's a great class to take over interterm.,1
"If i could grade him a 0, I would. Worst professor I have ever taken. Explains things horrible and is skittish and frantic. His lectures are boring and he's horrible and explaining things. I feel bad because i'm sure he's a very nice man, just really not a great professor.",0
"By far the worst professor I ever had. HE is not organized, rude when a question is asked, hard tests.. you won't learn in his class, there are many other great professor teaching this course,",0
"Al is the best!!! He is really caring and understanding. I took his class in fall 2020, I was infected by covid and I was really off track from classes. I turned in assignments 5,6, and the final project after the final grade is posted! And Al was kind enough to grade all of those assignments and gives me FULL CREDITS FOR IT!! I end up with a B!!",1
"Avoid!!! Does not teach. Lectures are in a quiet monotone voice, and he reads off unoriginal slides. Sits in his chair for the remainder of the lab. You end up having to learn all the material yourself. Worst professor ever.",0
I had Vest for both my FYS and a Creative Writing course and he was great in both of them.  He genuinely cares about his students and is one of the easiest professors to approach outside of class.  He is rather laid back and loves to see his students express themselves creatively.,1
"Worst math professor in the world! She is no help her class is impossible. Even if you go to her for extra help everyday, she will still fail you. Does not mind failing students. Would not at all recommend her! She is horrible!Avoid!!!",0
"Blute is awesome! He actually cares about his student and how they do in the class, and he is super fair with his exams. He is good at explaining things, in as fun and interestingly as calculus can be. He gives practice exams and midterm that are super helpful, and his expectations are clear. Awesome teacher!!",1
Not at all what I expected. His whole class is based on his stories. I went to every class and paid attention and still did not perform well on exams. The paper is easy and he offers extra credit but it's more philosophy than psychology. Learned nothing about personality..SKIP IT!,0
"Bobo is the man. Super cool prof, with a touch of savageness when necessary.",1
"Chris is the nicest guy you'll meet. Problem is, he has no idea how to teach and no idea how to get the right words across to you. You can't just sit and listen to him. If you want to get anything from his lectures, you have to pay extra close attention, think a little bit, and ask lots and lots of questions.",0
"in office hours he refused to tell me which multiple choice questions I got wrong (after the exam): how is someone supposed to proactively improve their stratgies and weak areas, if they are not told which questions are wrong. What is the ppoint of picking up an exam that has no marks except for a total on the top. He doesnt even post an answer key",0
"Dr. Corlett is one of the most amazing professors at state. He has immense wisdom and just one particular way to describe him would be inaccurate. I learnt more from this class than any of the classes. Dr. Corlett does make sarcastic comments and admits it. If you are someone really willing to learn, you should take this class. Ready to be refuted?",1
One of the best teachers I have had. Very caring and helpful. Grades fairly.,1
"Love this guy, had a lot of fun joking around in class. Has open note, open book exams. Projects are rather easy, he'll help you out with any problem you have in his office hours.",1
He is one of the best professors I have had at TCU. Lectures are easy to understand. The materials definitely helps you a lot in practicing. He's hilarious and makes classes very relaxing. Just take him.,1
"prof. jarret is great. he's very clear in class, and if you see him during office hours he's really helpful. even if you suck at chem, he'll make sure you know it by the time you're finished, as long as you put in the work. take him if you want to learn the subject. don't take him if you want to slack off. tests are HARD.",1
"He is a nice guy but does not understand that the course is for accounting students. It is not a comp sci class, we do not need to learn how to write computer code that we will never use in real life. Projects were horrible but if you go to his office he will be very helpful.",0
"Simha is great. He expects lots of class participation, but that makes class interesting and fosters learning. Check BB for your participation grades and talk to him if you believe you should be getting better because it's somewhat subjective. I felt like my input was valued and respected. I highly recommend this professor.",1
"Was extremely intimidated by course and Dr. A at first, but class is extremely interesting and Dr. A is really approachable. Exams and paper are fairly graded. Shake of your shyness before taking this class because it is heavy on the discussion (in a good way).",1
Very frustrating to have as a Professor. Not a clear communicator at all. The readings and lectures are occasionally interesting but usually are just tedious and leave you feeling dead inside. Get ready to dedicating precious hours of your life writing long papers about applying vaguely defined political ideologies to a modern day film.,0
"Difficult material and he wasn't much help.  Lab was really rough- no one ever knew what was going on.  He's too vague about what he wants.  He's looking for something specific, but he won't tell you what it is.  Don't take him if you don't like essay tests.",0
Dr. Butler is the bomb dot com! She really knows her stuff. She makes the content fun and easy to remember. Lectures are short and her sense of humor makes the time go by fast. Exams are easy A if you study and attend class. I used to hate chemistry and she made it one of my favorite classes. Homework and labs are simple. Take her!!,1
"Lectures are very boring and long. There are 12 non cumulative exams and its nice being able to focus on one chapter a week. However, there are 200 slides per chapter so its a lot of information to cover just for 30 question multiple choice test. He knows his stuff and is willing to help. Go to class and get your clicker points.",1
He was nice at first but he clearly wants there to be a hierarchy of grades in his class. It's like he doesn't want to give out A's to people that log on for class every day and TRY. He's rude & queeny and sometimes he makes offensive & shady remarks. His grading is very nit picky and he loves giving you a borderline grade. Take with someone else!,0
First class I have ever failed (I have over 90 credits). Lessons are extremely confusing and the workload is akin to having a full time job while attending your other classes as well.  I was disappointed not to pass this course and will be taking another instructor's class over the summer.  Would not recommend this professor.,0
"I had high expectations for her, because she seemed like a very nice person. However, she's lazy when it comes to her lectures, and grades harshly. She curves significantly, but does not make it easy to do well. Sadly, she's the only biochemistry teacher. Be ready to use outside resources for learning...",0
Professor Jones was extremely organized which made it easy to succeed in class. He shows what is due every week and what is due the next week along with the points each week is worth. If you do your work you will get an A in the class. He also shoes you every week in the grade book what your rank is amongst his 100 students which makes it fun work.,1
"BEST PROFESSOR OF MY LIFE! IF YOU WANT TO LEARN ABOUT ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY, JUST PAY ATTENTION, BECAUSE HE KNOWS HIS MATERIAL!",1
"Carlson is an old fashioned teacher who is very knowledgable. During discussion he is a great help and wants you to succeed. The lectures are important to attend in order to understand what will be on each exam. He gives great study guides and opportunities for extra credit. You only need a 90 to receive an A in the class, just work hard and study.",1
"Senora Pilkington is a very kind professor. If you took a couple of years of Spanish in HS, you will be fine. She will get you up to speed if you feel rusty. Keep up with the homework and ask questions and you should receive an A.",1
"She's a great prof. Latin was sooo difficult for me to learn, but she made it so much fun even though I only barely passed this course. :) Grade breakdown: - Attendance and Participation  10% - Online Moodle Quizzes (mc quiz) 35% - Online Fall Moodle Quiz (mc quiz)  10% - Online Winter Moodle Quiz (mc quiz)  10% - In-Class Tests  35%",1
"There's a lot of reading and usually a quiz every class. If you read the material, you will pass the quizzes, and if you do the work, you will pass the class. He gives very detailed feedback on all papers. There's usually a bit of group work every class, which is also an easy A as long as you turn in the work.",1
he's a grrrreat prof. :)  plus not bad looking :),1
in my opinion she really isn't clear on what she wants from your discussion board post or essays until she has gave you your terrible or good grade. very good communication lots of reading and lectures fail a test and your grade will drop like a bad habit.,0
"If you want to have a challenge public speaking class, take her. She is not an easy A and if you mess up on your speech, she will not let you restart. Also, she is really picky on how you should perform your speech and she is an unorganized teacher .",0
"He did not seem to connect well with the class. In addition, he would break into random Spanish and French sentences that no one can understand. Professor Cruz is a tough grader and it made it hard for me to stay motivated knowing no matter how hard I tried, I could never get a good grade.",0
The course is very easy. Middle schoolers could pass but while it is an boring subject she was extremely boring. She treats the class like an assembly line and has her annoying kids proctoring. She let me fail with a 0 on an exam because I missed my section and came to a different one because of consistency but let another girl take hers.,0
"Irrational and convoluted. His directions are unclear and he makes no sense when speaking to him. Maybe someone should buy him a dictionary to look up the word ""evidence.""",0
Took her for BIO 355. She puts little to no information on the lecture slides and then grades on every small thing she said in class. Her exams are incredibly hard and very vague. She is a tough grader and often makes you feel dumb when you email her with a question. Would recommend taking a different prof for genetics if possible.,0
The Seyhan Ege text book is not very good and there were no other problem sets. Not my favourite instructor.,0
Dr. Tewari is great! Her lectures are very clear and well paced and she records them so attendance isn't mandatory. She also lets you use a cheat sheet on exams and get partial credit. Definitely recommend for Physics 2 if you have to take it.,1
"Great professor! Great material and a fun class. All grading is based on 3 exams and that is it, but if you go over the powerpoints, the key terms in the book, and the study guides given its a fairly easy class.",1
"Maria is awesome. 224 was a class that I dreaded and really wanted to take it with a good professor. I am so happy I went with Hegbloom. Her class was fun and she made the work tolerable for such a dry subject. If you still have to take 224, I recommend Maria. She will push you to become a better researcher and a better writer.",1
She actually states in her syllabus not to take class if you have a job or family obligations. Ok... who doesn't? Just really impractical and unfair for most people who have to work to put themselves through college. She doesn't teach much and her lectures are very scattered. Looks like she's over the teaching thing. Better profs available.,0
"Literally the worst teacher I have ever had in my life. The 350 character limit prevents me from telling you anything meaningful about this guy. You have to teach yourself everything and ignore his atrocious bedside manner. His tests are unfair/incoherent and your grades will be affected by it. Prepare to be depressed, angered, and confused.",0
"Pretty mundane lecturer. Tests were basically the lectures and were pretty hard. No extra credit given. Speeches and papers were graded extremely hard and only looked for ""key phrases"" instead of actual content or delivery. Grades largely depend on TA. Do not take Marguerite Liechenstein as your TA, unfair grader. Don't buy the book, waste of money",0
AVOID THIS MAN AT ALL COSTS. IF YOU LIKE OLD PERVERTS WHO ARE HARD ASSES ABOUT USELESS MANDATORY CLASSES THEN TAKE HIM IF NOT RUN AND HIDE HE IS A DICK,0
"Her phone goes off during speeches all the time. She is unclear in directions, and seems to confuse herself. She grades this level 100 class that most must take as if the people in it are supposed to be professional speakers. She does not pay attention during speeches and then counts points off for things she didn't hear, even if they are included",0
"Her class was pretty boring and she just talked about herself. However, I took her during the summer semester and she got some pretty good speakers and I really enjoyed some of them. Also, she gives quizzes every week and its mostly online. Other than that she is a cool teacher.",1
"His philosophy 101 class ended up unexpectedly being one of my favorite classes I've ever taken even though I initially only took it as a requirement. As long as you take good notes, don't miss a lot of classes, and study you're set. Not an easy A class, but definitely manageable if you put the effort in.",1
Wouldnt have passed w/o my smart boyfriend. Lectures are just him making something complicated when it is simple & he only lectured once or twice a week. I hardly attended class. Only days of quizzes/exams. Gives many assignments that are tedious & not helpful. You are better off getting tutored at the learning center than going to his class.,0
"Easiest class you could take in college. He's truly an inspiration and my favorite professor. If you have the option, TAKE HIM!",1
"Talks about himself the whole time and who he knows.  And he cusses frequently in a way to connect with the students.  At first, I didn't have a problem with it but now it's been overdone and is extremely unprofessional.",0
"Notes are taken off the board without powerpoints/other technology... make sure you pay attention or you will miss things. THE BOOK IS A MUST- you will need it to fill in holes. Overall okay guy, not my personal favorite.",0
"Marc has the right idea but poor method. At first, I appreciated Marc for his innovative thinking, charismatic attitude, and interest in student interaction. I quickly realized this was not his true demeanor. Marc is in fact poor at specifying grading criteria, poor at overall communication, and very disrespectful. Get a PhD, Marc. Embarrassing CU.",0
"Ive taken honors classes my whole life with tough graders. Long story short if you are accustomed to getting an A for A-level work, get ready to receive a B. After multiple meetings with the professor to discuss what I can do better I was blown off and given a B even after asking what I can do to get an A from day one after receiving 88s and 89s",0
He gives fill in notes that you have to print before lecture (completed notes not posted online) and did not once write on the board. He made it clear on day 1 that you should not email him with questions. Not one exam average was above a D. Claims not to curve. Gives minimal (if any) partial credit on exams/quizzes. Gives weekly sapling homework.,0
"His lectures are not prepared and are just him rambling on. They are long boring and he does not stop to explain anything. Homework is assigned randomly (not on syllabus). The exams are hard, but he usually give pretty good hints about the types of questions on them. The 4 exams make up 80% of your grade. I hope I never have him as a prof again.",0
Excellent professor. Would gladly take any class that he teaches.,1
Took intro to Sociology first semester and decided right then I would take another one of his classes because I liked him so much! (Now taking Sociology of Marriage) His devotions were very inspiring and eye-opening. He really makes Sociology super interesting and engages the (large) class. His tests (which are all of your grade) are moderate.,1
Don't Miss This Class- It is awesome and the professor's a genius with Pre-trial litigation. Some students saw some BS written in 2012- negative- BS. This class is great- it's not easy- it's complicated material- part of being an attorney- but he tries to get you the best info for real-life. If you're not going to get invested in this class-well...,1
"She got rid of extra credit. She prepares you well for the exams, but the final is a huge curveball so expect tears",0
"For a night class in the dead of winter, this professor was even colder. rarely smiled & a little insulting in her feedback. Worst part of my entire master's program experience. I determined that if I ever decided to teach, I would be the opposite of this professor - encouraging, engaging and someone who gets you excited about the material",0
Worst teacher I have ever experienced. Elementary Spanish 1 became level 3 Spanish her  tests are over 100 questions. She doesn't respond to emails. I explained to her how during one of the online exams that my computer crashed and emailed her right away but not response. Went to talk to her about it and she said there was nothing I can do. BS,0
"I had a horrible experience with this professor. I thought the class would get better after the first week, but it didn't. So, I dropped it. She makes things overly complicated and doesn't even explain things well. A ton of weekly homework too.",0
"Avoid him at all costs, especially if never exposed to logic circuits/EE. Be prepared for disorganized lectures, material not covered to be on exams, and to never know your grade because of his grading system. There is little/no explanation on wiring a breadboard/components, and topics are taught out of order. You'll be better off watching YouTube.",0
"Professor Ojeda is a smart woman, but her lectures are very confusing. Most of the time the class has no idea what she's talking about. Prepare to do a lot of self teaching because at time her powerpoints are very vague. Make sure to read the chapters before class or you'll be very confused.",0
Wonderful.,1
"She may seem distant and not very helpful at first, but if you just talk to her one-on-one she's actually extremely helpful, down to earth, and concerned with how you're doing in her class.",1
"Scott really makes the topics interesting and I always looked forward to his classes. There are a lot of things said in lectures that are important in understanding the material in the book. He is hilarious, and for me he made the classes very enjoyable.",1
"By far the worst teacher I've ever had. She thinks she's a good teacher... but she's not. She begins every class by telling us we suck and that its our fault for not understanding the material. From a student that has attended every class, I can say shes terrible. Lot's of work, never a break. Maybe if this is your only class you can succeed.",0
"AVOID AT ALL COSTS.  This guy is a terrible professor all he does is ramble on about unrelated topics and then say ""that's what leaders do, that's why they get paid the big bucks.""  As a senior I expected this to be an easy elective and I do more work for this class than any of my 400 level classes. Ton of busy work. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS",0
"Had this prof for my PhD. She made fun of students, and would attack people if they questioned her. No grading feedback the whole term. She seems to have a big ego. I'm super skeptical about the 7 separate 5/5 glowing reviews submitted on the same date January, 10th. Didn't feel I learned anything, and that's the worst part of all.",0
"Professor Greene seems like she really likes the subject matter. Not the most engaging or interactive teacher. A little harsh with the papers, but if you really study and think critically you'll be okay with her tests.",1
"This was my first experience with a college professor, and it was great. He's quite helpful and not too demanding. Lots of reading and discussion, but if you're dedicated it's a fun class.",1
"Hardest professor I've ever had. I would not recommend taking him. He lectures straight off power points but flies through them like you already know the information. I didn't learn much from this class at all. Quizzes are hard. Tests are hard too, but are communulative throughout the semester. ALOT of studying outside of class. DO NOT TAKE!",0
Best English professor. She helps you when you need help. Gives you feedback on what to improve and believes in you! The lessons and essays were easy. I enjoyed the class a lot.,1
HE IS A GREAT TEACHER..TO ME HE LOOKS JUST LIKE A HISTORY TEACHER SHOULD LOOK !! HE MAKES ME WANT TO LEARN HISTORY.. AND THE TESTS ARE PRETTY EASY IF  YOU DO ALL THE READING..,1
"she rocks! show up, take notes, she tells you what is on the tests, do the 3 papers and do the final, EASY PASS AND UNITS!!!!!!",1
Most amazing prof at CMU. If you are going into education she will make you consider a minor in Middle Level. Very enthusiastic. Loves her job and students.,1
"She is a very nice person and accessible during office hours... but the tests were very detailed and there were no study guides. There were days for review before the test, but that was just used to go over the notes one more time. She is very picky about your work and if you skip a lecture or lab - I have no idea how you could pass.",1
"Cannot teach seems knowledgeable but cannot teach. You will have to learn every thing on your own if you want to pass. WHen you ask him a question which he tells you  you must to pass he doesnt answer it and never says what he is doing Analogy: He teaches you what a baseball is, a bat is, and a glove is, and then tells you go  play baseball!",0
"If there is an example of what a professor should be, it is Professor Teaford.  He had a passion for the subject that carried over to lecture.  Plus he was very focused on student success, both in and out of the classroom, as a student group advisor.  Purdue should challenge every professor to be as engaging and active as Professor Teaford was.",1
One of the best classes I have ever taken; an example of why higher education should exist. Dr Boden is a consummate professional with a dazzling array of subject knowledge coupled with incandescent enthusiasm and remarkable organization and presentation skills. A masterful communicator who motivates learners beyond their own perceived limitations,1
unclear unhelpful unable to make sense.  Follow directions to the letter or you will be penalized.,0
"I took this because I am a nurse and feel it's important to be educated on social problems. He only focused on the perspectives of sociology, never actually ""taught"" anything. Discussion boards were all opinion based, but still never able to get full credit. Unless you are majoring in Sociology, I would steer clear of this professor.",0
You're better off taking this class with a different professor. Expect her to tell you that you should focus on her class and ignore your other classes.,0
"I love Professor McKenna! She is such a sweet lady and really wants all her students to do well. Attendance is mandatory, but she keeps the class interesting. Definitely take her if you can!!",1
Best teacher ever can do 10 examples with full explanations in record time of 50 minutes 3 times the pace of any other math professor.,1
"Listen I love Moira and I've taken many of her classes but.. I've found that she can be a bit of a bully and she will point out if you say something stupid. As her classes got harder I found that she would take off grades for things she never told us to do, or wouldn't understand why we wrote something when its exactly what she said to do.",1
"First, Ledford may be the best professor at CWRU.  I don't think I had ever worked harder for a class prior to this one.  HOWEVER, his passion, energy, and knowledge are so evident.  You'll learn about things you never thought you'd learn about (German, facts about CWRU, etc.).  Do well, talk with him, and he'll be there for you later on.",1
"Dr. SInha is a very nice lady, but her lectures are poorly organized. Not just her, but the prof she co-lectures with. The tests are similar to lecture, but you must read the book and truly study from the BIS labs to do well. She needs to work on organization and making points clearer. I don't recommend taking her class.",0
"I took the corporate tax class with Godfrey. not sure about section number???  godfrey knows his stuff and is fun to listen to. Tough to follow most of the time, but still interesting.  His exams are easy because they are open notes.  don't be afraid to ask questions in class.  he's not as mean as people are writing.  don't take life so seriously.",0
"I am learning absolutely nothing. He is rude, inconsiderate, and heartless. Luckily he means absolutely nothing in the real world of show business. If you have him just know that.",0
This teacher should be fired. You leave his class with less confidence than when you started because he makes fun of you if you dont understand in front of the whole class.,0
"If you need a science class take AST 103 with Daniel Proga! his lectures are very interesting and he makes the class fun and making you want more. He gives you the actual test questions but you have to find the answers on your own from the textbook. My advice, if you want an A in the class read the textbook, study for exams and pay attention!",1
"Good teacher, Quiz every day but you get a 2.0 for writing your name of the paper. Weekly journal over what you read, midterm, final and group project.Tests are all short answer over quotes that were discussed during class. What play they're from, who said them and why they are important. Read and go to class and you'll be good",1
"Just like the other person said, do NOT expected full credit on anything. There are no tests or quizzes and don't bother buying the book, we never used it once. Her PowerPoints were interesting though. Overall, I wouldn't recommend her.",1
She's a great instructor and very easy. I even emailed a lab report a day before it was due to her to see if it needed improvement and she sent it back less than 30 minutes later. she's very dependable and willing to help. She'll even tell you the answers if you just take the time to ask her. she's great!,1
"Awesome professor! Great lectures! He makes difficult material so easy to understand. Not having an A in his class, would honestly require active self sabotage, because he gives SO many extra credit opportunities. He cares so much about his students.",1
"Ridiculously hard evaluations (Midterm, Final). Does tend to take questions directly out of the assignments for the final, therefore, memorization of the answers is a must. Otherwise, a nice and funny prof, albeit a bit arrogant.",0
She takes quite a while to grade assignments but is very helpful and quick to respond to emails. There are assignments available for extra credit. She certainly cares about her students passing.,1
"If you're in his class for Quantitative Methods, I have only one piece of advice for you. GET OUT NOW! How he is qualified as a teacher is beyond me. You will not LEARN anything, but you will pass his in-class tests very easily. Beware come exam time as the only thing you will only have learned how to copy off others. Ho' Boy, Enjoy... ",0
Wow-this guy is easily one of the worst teachers I have ever had...I'd rather stab my eyes out than sit through another one of his classes. Not only are his tests absolutely horrifying but he will do NOTHING to prepare you for them.  He may be a CPA but he sure as hell isn't a teacher.,0
"She's very vague. I have no interest in sociology whatsoever so I found her classes to be very boring. Her exams are pretty easy, 20-30 MC from the book and then essay questions. YOU NEED TO BE VERY DETAILED IN THE ESSAYS. When I emailed her questions I didn't feel like she answered them at all. From what I've heard there are better teachers",0
"Dr. Bellamy is a good choice if you would rather have a thorough understanding of the material as opposed to an easy A. He will make you work for your grade, but he works very hard to convey the information clearly during his lectures. He will happily explain something to you again during his office hours (as long as you attended the lecture).",1
"Dykstra amazes me (in a horrible way). Extremely opinionated and a shame she is still on staff. Try your best to keep your personal life to yourself as she will most likely find something about you she doesn't like. Once that happens, you are screwed. After a few weeks it is pretty clear which of the students she likes and which ones she doesn't.",0
"Very disappointing to him this semester, a rough test with strict marks. And rude always, lacking a minimum of respect for the students.",0
"Horrifying. He does know how to teach dance, but he's NOT worth the effort. A 100 level dance class should be fun, not esteem lowering. Would make rude, unnecessary comments. Belittles people to make himself feel better. Don't do it!!",0
Wonderful teacher. Makes information relevant. You will learn and in a good way! This is the professor to go with if you have a choice.,1
Professor Miritello is a great teacher. She's very understanding and makes class fun. I always look forward to Professor's class. Professor cares about her students. She guides us to improve our writing and always makes time to help. She also inspires you to ask questions which have helped tremendously when it comes to writing papers and learning.,1
"She seems like a really nice lady, but I can tell the pressures of online teaching have got to her. Her slides are super detailed and helpful, but make sure to also read the textbook as well. Also, good luck if you have a question regarding any of the material, she'll most likely tell you to look at the syllabus. Still a pretty good prof though.",1
Wonderful teacher! I have never been so interested and moved by a class before hers. I have always loved short stories and writing and she just added fuel to the fire! Her passion touched me and I think that is a rare gift in a teacher when they can do that.,1
"Worst professor I've taken, so disappointed that he even teach for a CSU, he's lazy, unclear, rude, and only grades through 2 midterms and a final, no attendance grade, no quiz grade, no extra credit whatsoever.  Heavy accent, low voice, chicken scratch writing, doesn' tuse the mic in a large lecture hall",0
"Professor White structures her classes in a fashion which equally disperses student workload across the semester, which helps a lot when finals week approaches. In general, Professor white offers many opportunities in and out of class from herself and writing consultants to help with writing papers for the class, and just writing in general.",1
Great teacher and a great class. Can seem harsh at first but is a wonderful person once you get to know her and get into the class. DOGS in every class.,1
"He takes attendance for a grade, so you should show up for class. Only uses the book for daily quizzes. His lectures are boring and he doesn't go over much in class, so you will have to study a lot. Tests are hard, but he does give extra credit after every test. Overall, I do not recommend.",0
"She appears interested, but her lectures are hard to understand, and not just due to the accent.  She tends to write random notes all over the board.  Maybe the best prof in a class with three poor teachers.",0
"I took this class online, and it was time-consuming and frustrating. The tests are challenging, but doable if you read the material. There are five long papers (making up 55% of the grade) to write with very little to go on for rubrics/instructions. His unfairness in grading these monstrous papers (10-20 pgs) was infuriating. Would not recommend.",0
Worst class EVER. I'm a straight A student and I failed this class. His expectations are waaaaaaaay too high and he won't stop talking about his glory days at the UW and their expectations. He's the only teacher that has made me cry.,0
"Best professor ever! Incredibly interesting lectures, time flies by unnoticeably! Dr. Clasen is very knowledgeable and cares about your knowledge as well as your grade. Prepare to work and to study. I haven't worked that hard in a class ever in my life, but I exit it confidently with solid knowledge. Thank you, Dr. Clasen! You taught me well!",1
"Way too hard for a 100 level class!!! His lectures are all over the place and his monotone voice doesn't help. It's a little better if you go to office hours, but he has an attitude. He is INCREDIBLY knowledgeable of the Middle East because he lived there for years. But avoid this class. The textbook is useless. The only exams are take home essays",0
"Dr. Grange is a fantastic teacher and has been called ""the best of the best"" when it comes to what he does.  The class is, by nature, extremely difficult.  He is very clear about that from the beginning, and does all in his power to help you succeed.  Try to take the class when you can guarantee serious study time and avoid the 7-week version.",1
"My main problem I had with Sammy was his classes. Reads directly off the slides and if you can't write as fast as he talks, you'll just not have that information. He posts his notes no where because he doesn't want them ""stolen."" STUDY FOR THE TESTS! One bad grade on those it's hard to recover without acing the rest.",0
"David, overall is a pretty nice professor. However, his teaching style is VERY outdated. You take tons of notes everyday and expects you to know the information based on the textbook&homework. Homework isn't graded but DO THEM, EVERYTHING YOU WILL LEARN WILL BE BASED OFF THE TEXTBOOK. He makes mistakes so please POINT IT OUT to him. Also DONT SKIP.",1
Absolutely useless. A disgrace to the Faculty of Engineering.,0
"Advanced archaeological theory with chazan is great. he's so flexible with handing in assignments, the debate in the class is great and he genuinely wants to help his students!",1
"Lectures are pretty boring but the real problem is that if you have any questions they will be dismissed or, if they are answered, it is done in an unclear fashion. She clearly doesn't care what you have to say. Also, no HW is nice, but it means that you're graded on a quiz, midterm, final and ONE assignment. Really, don't take this class.",0
Maher was not organized in his lectures. He would include irrelevant material in his lectures that would not be on his exams. He gave tests that included essays and definitions that were ridiculous. He was not clear when asked what he was looking for in the essays. The only way to pass is the attend each class and take notes over everything he says,0
Antoinetti is the man. Explains all the material very clearly. Nothing is online so you have to go to class. Quizzes and exams are straight from the notes. Don't buy the book. It is not needed one bit. Likes to crack jokes in class. Sometimes picks on kids but means no harm. Great professor to take economics with.,1
"This class was based off of 4 test grades and an average of the pop-quizzes as another test grade. He never gave reviews, lectures bounced around and tests would be based off of the book and lecture notes. Never had power points and rarely wrote on the board as a visual aid. Also class attendance was mandatory in order to take the pop-quizzes.",0
"She obviously has a great amount of subject knowledge and personal experience with Asian studies, but she is a very poor presenter. Her lectures are long, boring, scattered. Use Wikipedia if you want to know what's going on. ",0
"he lectures every day the whole time, you have to write 8 one page papers for the whole semester, and ask a question within the paper then present it, he will then tell you that your question and opinion are wrong and embarass you. He grades the papers but does not put them anywhere. Finals are tomorrow and I still do not know my grade. Never again",0
Don't listen to the rest of these reviews because they are faker than a flying talking unicorned donkey wrestling a rich tax paying man who also does the dishes and his own laundry. Dr. Evan's is a sweet sweet prof. who bless his heart tries his best but.... you know he is special in a not good kinda way.,0
One of the best professors! Attendance and participation are not required. He takes tough philosophical concepts and breaks it down very easily for everyone. He is clear on what he wants and he reviews for days before the final. Take him if you want to get a solid education!,1
"HORRIBLE class. Once a week class was based entirely on textbook ""summaries"" conducted by students. I never read the books--never had to! There is a final paper and project (during research I DID finally learn something), but besides this a dud of a class. Don't take, you'll kill yourself. Not at all what I would expect out of a 400 level ArtHclass",0
"Worst professor. Great subject but he didn't teach it well, so it made the class super difficult. Even with a tutor and going the CSC, I was still struggling. Don't take this class with this professor. His tests are nitpicky and ridiculously hard.",0
"Taken him online twice now, he is very easy going and a nice older guy. Does take a little while for him to grade papers unless your taking a multiple choice test/quiz online.",1
"Capstick is a nice guy, however this class is a disaster. The structure is made that you teach yourself everything in groups but he never tells you if you're right. No textbook. Lots of hw. Hw rarely coincided and was impossible unless you went to O.H. Barely any lectures, or sample questions given. Exams and quizzes are hard. 3 hour classes 2xweek",0
"Even though his Finals are hard. He is one of the best instructors at East Bay. He replies fast and is very kind and helpful. I took two ITM classes with him. Do your website, weekly homework which is easy and you'll pass. Just his exams are pretty hard.",1
"Pros: - Flexible on the due date of homework if a life event pops up.  Cons: - No feedback on the graded homework so you have no idea where you went wrong. - Says he gives partial credit on the exams, but he doesn't. - Really hard to follow his lectures, so I spent hours outside of class watching Prof. Leonard to teach myself the subject material.",0
"First, I don't know how the previous reviews said the tests were difficult. You don't even need to show up... She seems like a good lady, but she is an atrocious teacher. You DON'T learn anything. For her gen bio classes, if you're good at memorizing then it's an easy A+. Don't take her if you want to learn. Take her if you want an easy A",0
NO class! Must read book and articles that seems like the professor wrote?? The class is taught by yours truly... yourself. If you want a class with no just information you need to know and teach yourself then be my guest. Professor does email you reminders and quizes and tests have long extensions but I would not recommend this class. Timed tests,0
"This class can be summed up in one word: vague. The textbook and Burton himself talk a lot, but don't really say much. Definitely read the book and go to class to do well. The tests seem like their written by a third grader, they're vague and difficult to understand.",0
She was the best instructor I ever had! Her lectures were very clear.  I learned a lot in her Data Structures class.  I really understand pointers and tree structures.,1
"bad professor, not helpful at all. Just tells you to read the chapters and expects you to do a 60 question test in 30 minutes...dont take this guy trust me.",0
Worst teacher I have ever had at CMU. Cares more about his tax job than students.  Expects you to already know what he is talking about and knows about taxes. Barely any office hours. Doesn't use email. Only grades 4 exams and 2 projects. Takes attendance every class and marks grade down every class you miss. TERRIBLE DO NOT TAKE!,0
"Awesome prof. The course is pretty boring, but she made classes interesting. Most people probably wouldn't have gone if a different prof was teaching. She can be a hard marker, but she's fair. Very approachable and helpful if you have any questions about the class or anything else. Definitely would recommend Mary Oxner, one of the best profs at X!",1
Great funny prof. Average grader for the course. 100% would take again,1
"he was very rude to most of his students. his assignments are very hard, which would be fine if he was helpful, but he isn't. i don't need my project done for me, but i at least need some inkling of what i'm supposed to do. i'll be honest and say this class was the reason i switched my major.",0
"The most frustrating class I have ever taken. He has no respect for other opinions. I can understand teaching such strict catholic beliefs to a class of theology majors, but not a class that is predominantly students that are just there to cover the requirement. Take through notes because that is what you are going to have to rely on to study.",0
Professor Rollock is very passionate about Abnormal Psychology. It is infectious. Seriously one of the best classes I have taken at Purdue so far.,1
"I had Chen for two semesters straight and loved him both times. He's super funny and has a contagious laugh. His sense of humor is kind of on the dark side, which is funny to me. For ethics, be prepared to talk or sit in silence if no one will. For logic, make sure to work on problems outside of class because they can be kinda tricky.",1
Dr. Gonzalez is by far my favorite professor. She teaches very well and genuinely cares for her students.,1
Ms Hutton talks in a monotone voice and makes you feel like falling asleep. She flies through the powerpoint and is unclear about assignments. If you miss a class or come in late she marks it down and drops a letter grade..that's what happened to me. If I had taken EDUC 101 with her I would have been turned off to teaching. Take Kimberly Bell!,0
Explains everything in the most complicated way possible.,0
"I loved Prof. Taylor! Sierra lacks many film classes, so I was rlly grateful to take this class & end up with such a wonderful teacher! She is funny, intelligent, inspiring and understanding! She showed us great movies and gave amazing feedback, I'm really bummed I didn't get to take this in person! Workload was easy and consistent! Must take! :)",1
"Trombley is the worst teacher I have experienced. I was having a major surgery on the day a test was given. I asked if I could redo the test, but she informed me that he doesn't give redo's. I told her my situation, and all she said was you should have scheduled it another day. I scheduled this months before signing up for this class. Unforgiving.",0
"give low really grade on lab report although u have 20 pages, barely can hear him, never ever c/p someone's work on ur report even though u only use  5% out of ur entire work, he considers it's cheating, and report to university. over all he is easy but mean.",0
"Took honors intro to music with him, and he is a great professor. He just writes notes on the board, but he is very clear about his expectations and what to expect on the test. Read the text, go to class, and study even just a little and you'll be fine. He also offers extra credit and I ended up not having to take the final.",1
"Alynn was a great prof for KIN 150. She was always willing to help students with anything they were struggling with and broke down theories/movements to make them easier to understand. She was available to meet outside of class, and grades practical exams based on what you are capable of, not in comparison with other people in the class.",1
"Scheduled another prof. and got Nicastro. If you want to get yelled at and feel stupid for an entire physics lab take Nicastro. As the chair of the department, he was teaching a very low level physics lab and was taking it wayyy too seriously.",0
Dr. Hansen is one of the best professors I've ever had. He does all of his exams in class because he is anti-testing center. His tests are straightforward as long as you do the study guide. You can tell he LOVES the environment and he makes boring things seem so interesting. His assignments are made to specifically get to know his students!,1
Very hard to understand what he wants out of his assignments. Does not answer questions with clarity. Seems as confused as the students.I do NOT recommend this teacher!,0
"I had him for both 314 and 370 (SPN Lit) and he is definitely NOT a good grammar professor. He was fun and the class was extremely easy, so if that's what you're looking for, definitely take his class. But if Spanish is actually important to you and you really want to learn the grammar, which is essential to learning a language: TAKE SOMEONE ELSE.",1
"Genuinely most boring teacher ever. If you want live coding good luck. All he does is read off powerpoints and tells story of his life. Also, most of my class failed midterm or did terribly so our midterm doesnt even count. The worst thing is he puts on this fun teacher vibe but when you approach him hes actually pretty stern and uncomprising.",0
"He's an all around good teacher. He takes the time out to help you understand what's taking place.  He does problems on the board to help you understand, which is GREAT because I'm a hands-on and visual learner. I look forward to taking ACC 102. You do have to do work in this class. BE ON TIME for test days or you won't be allowed to take the test.",1
Great mentor for women in Economics - down to earth !,1
Great professor. Goes over everything that will be on her tests and is very accessible if you have any questions. Highly recommended that you take her.,1
"He grabs a six pack and goes out on his bull dozer in the woods when his wife annoys him. This man is hilarious and if you go to the pass sessions theres no reason not to get an A. The tests are like 20 short answers that I finished in about 30 minutes. Super easy A, great man.",1
Nice guy!  He is so enthusiastic about teaching gym that you can't help but like him.  Highly recommended!,1
HOT.,1
He was entertaining but difficult.,0
"Apparently he's the department chairman, and for good reason - MAN is he BORING! - his online course materials are lame, but the key is to stay awake while reviewing them. Can't imagine having him in a classroom. Sadly, he's the only option for this class. Wouldn't be getting a finance certificate if I'd had this blowhard first! Avoid if u can!!!",0
"Aced his class. But if I had the choice to take it again, I would not take it with him. I learned a lot about the course material but none of it was from him. He takes 10 weeks to discuss Relational Calculus/Algebra and intro to SQL, and gives the last 5 weeks to work on a project (which has to be industry professional or he fails you). Hard pass",0
learnt a lot about OS. Gives the latest  on OS and what is important.  his last lecture on virtual machines  was  great. Makes a lot of effort in helping students get the concepts.,1
"Boring. Research project is impossible to do, she needs to calm down and realize that this is a community college, and we're not writing a thesis for graduate school.",0
"Don't take this class too seriously. There were a few people that were just peeing their pants every time something even more complicated came up. Those people just need to know only the exceptional student is going to get EVERYTHING from the course, and that's the way it was designed. I mean come on, we still all got A's.  Chill out, it's DigiPen.",1
"Took his DLD class last spring, I stopped going to the lectures about halfway through the semester. Be prepared to teach yourself the subject matter, and use the old tests that he provides. Tests were about 60-65% of the final grade. The book the homework is out of has a free PDF online, but he gives you most of the HW answers anyways.",0
"she is awesome ESL professor. she is caring about student a lot, lectures are amazing, the class is easygoing , help you a lot. I love the class that I had with her.",1
"Hardest english professor I've ever had. Majority of classes are lectures and very tough grader. No matter how hard you try, or how long you work to do well on papers she will always find a problem. She looks to give bad grades. She has no clue what is going on in her class, no one listens to her.",0
The guy doesn't teach whatsoever. He tells you he's on your side but that's a load of.... Instead of teaching you the material he talks about how bad professors are nowadays when hes the worst of them all. His exams are really hard and the fact that you have to teach yourself doesn't help.,0
Final is 40% of grade 3 exams-drops lowest Exams are heavily focused on textbook Required to write a paper that none of the other PS100 classes are asked to do She posts the powerpoints on blackboard but they don't help if you don't go to lecture Tompson is very knowledgeable but her class is a lot of work for an intro to psych class,1
"This course was not very good, the teacher is really mean if you don't understand everything right away he yells at you. He doesn't help you at all to understand. He is one of those teachers that if you don't get  then you need to figure it out. Did not enjoy this class at all because he was so rude and mean to the students trying to learn and cant",0
"Extremely long powerpoints but will e-mail slides to class after presentation. Nice man, however seems somewhat aloof as most of his slides are disorganized and directly from the text. Class is important for learning exam material, but can do well just by reading the book. Do the extra credit and read the material- it would be hard not to pass.",1
"He is pretty cool. Although he teaches by lecture, rather than an interactive experience. His Korean accent, although adorable, sometimes gets in the way of understanding how somethings are pronounced. He also has occasional moments of funniness. He is not the best teacher, but he gets the job done.",1
"She is hard. Doesn't answer emails right away, doesn't answer questions through email either.  Have taken her for other classes so I knew what to expect. However, her test questions sometimes are not in the book or in her lectures if it weren't for other classes I've taken I might not have done as well",0
"Probably not the worst out there, but definitely not the best.  She will drop you for attendance, and being even a minute late counts as half an absence (as does leaving to use the restroom or for any other matter.)  I will give her credit for working with students well.  She speaks before thinking often, and needs to be corrected when this happens",1
Pretty good prof he really does seem like he cares about people passing gives grading criteria at beginning to corse and sticks to it.,1
Very good teacher! classes very laid back but useful.  Defiantly take his class,1
Basically handed us some slideshows and we were on our own.,0
"Dr. Wolfram is an excellent professor. She just does not believe in ""spoon feeding""  She is also very approachable and great at lecturing statistics.",1
"Brian, why don't you change your profession? Why not adopt your passion (of bragging about Italian blood) as your professions (become Italian PM)?",0
"Adolino is boring, and honestly, biased in her teaching of a comparative politics course. She teaches you her opinion and expects you to think that is the correct answer in tests and quizzes. The course material isn't dense, and its just 3 tests and 6 quizzes, which are honestly really confusing because she is terrible at wording her questions.",0
"Nice guy, some of his jokes are over the top.  He talks really fast and jumps around a lot. Not very helpful when you are lost. Assumes everyone understands the material the first time around. Lots of homework, do not take this class if you have a full load.",1
Professor Mauer made me really excited to begin taking English classes. He always responds quickly to students and gives great feedback. He provides all of the necessary reading materials. He gives two papers and grades them fairly. The online setup is perfected to make things easy to access. He also gave extra credit opportunities which helped.,1
"My other absolute FAVOURITE prof McGill!! A MUST take :) It was genuinely the most rewarding class I've taken in university. She is *so* invested in her students and their work, I can confidently say that taking her class changed the way I approach research and write academic papers for the better. I would take her a 3rd time if I could!! A+ prof!!",1
"Do not take this class if you are not a serious student! She is a very good professor. But I WARN YOU. THIS IS NOT AN EASY CLASS!! If your looking to have another blow off class, this one with her is not that. She gives ALOT of papers, has high expectations and will grade your work very thoroughly.",1
I picked this teacher from the reviews on here saying it was easy and that its mostly power points. I hated it she goes through the slides quickly without giving you time to write them down using the excuse for you to check them online its wasted time in class. Expect the same boring power points every single day. She also makes the test confusing.,0
"Lectures are boring, but they get to the point. Do the homework and use the reviews  he has online. Tests are tough but usually are based on the general concepts.",1
"Professor Tierney ensured this class for complete disaster. He himself estimated that a typical nightâs homework should take âbetween 4-5 hours.â He does not grade assignments in appropriate time, handing back our midterm one week before the final. The structure of the class is nonexistent. My experience was absolutely ridiculous.",0
great prof. not a lot of reading but still have too. do journals they help and just follow the handout he gives for the paper and you can get an A,1
"This was a very relaxing language class. You follow the book closely up to chapter 7, do homework online, and quizzes in the testing center. Adrian is always willing to help students and even will cut time out of the end of class to help you. If you are a good self learner, study the material, and don't cram the night before you should be fine!",1
"Get ready to read. Pretty tough grader, and not very approachable outside class so it was difficult to get feedback on assignments. This course was also very philosophy/theory based, and was rather dry - and often difficult - because of that. Unfortunately, I wouldn't recommend.",0
Good at helping with writing papers but extremely boring and condescending.,0
Brandon Jones is so far my favorite professor at NAU. He really cares about his students as well as the subject. ISM 120 can be a difficult class but he makes it enjoyable.,1
Professor Levine was the best professor I had so far in my college curriculum. There were 3 books assigned for us. To be honest you can just read the summary of those books online and you will be more than good. Very down to earth guy. No Hw just 3 exams. The exams are very similar to what he teaches in class.,1
"I took computer vision class. - Had to study from text books, online videos to understand the concepts - Prof is very helpful, accessible outside class. Just drop at his office!  - Get ready for doing lots of programming. Pretty cool stuff.  - Review his slides, you will be good in exams. Not a tough grader at all.",0
"Language Development with Dr. Childers was an awesome class. Shes passionate about her subject and her lectures, so listening to her talk is a breeze. Theres a lot to read, but as long as you can participate some, youll be fine. Shes also a great listener and does respond to feedback about her class.",1
"Burton is such a bad professor. Im taking his class right now and he goes weeks without communicating with his students. He doesnt teach and sometimes doesnt even show up for class when the students do. When you ask him questions about the class material, hes very rude and doesnt answer them. He talks about himself during the whole class.",0
WORST PROFESSOR EVER! DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS WITH HER! She grades insanely hard and gives you no chance to save your grade. She is unclear on what she wants you to write in your essays. Even if you turn it in early and fix all of your mistakes she gives you a bad grade! The lowest grade I have ever received! AND SHE IS RUDE IF YOU ASK FOR HELP!,0
This is the worst Prof I have ever have in my lift hope he live a pathetic life,0
"Nice guy. Thick accent. Class was a waste of time. I only went to get extra credit for perfect attendance. Lectures were all powerpoint slides that he later posted online. DON'T BUY THE BOOK! It's not needed at all. If you can turn on a computer, you are probably overqualified for this class.",0
"DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR. He holds ""office hours"" 2 times a week, which is really another lecture. If you can't make it to these ""office hours"" you are at a major disadvantage because he covers material he sometimes doesn't cover in class. He also puts things on the exam he barely even talks about. Worst professor I have had in college so far.",0
"I took this class so I'd learn how to use Dream Weaver, completely a waste of time. He does not teach you how to use it at all. Do not take this online course if you are completely unfamiliar with this software!",0
Try avoiding this guy at all cost.,0
"Doesnt know the material, just reads directly off of the slides she gives you, doesnt know how to pronounce half the words in the slides either. Brutal to sit through the lectures.",0
"Constantly whinged about ""knowing"" that online students were cheating, so changed quiz times without telling anyone and allowed only 30 seconds per question. When students complained, he put up an equally whinge-y video basically saying any fool could do the quizzes. Too bad, because his lectures were interesting, but his paranoia was unsettling.",0
I cannot thank this lady enough for getting me through my first science class since high school!,1
Hate this kind of proffs.  Doesn't teach anything specific. Answers on a test could be anything you want as long as you justify your answer.,0
"Simply an awesome class.  Aside from required attendence, she knew quite a bit about the subject and was very objective with treatments of varying ideas.  Definetely worth it if you're interested in ideology",1
"Don't ever pass up the opportunity to take a class by Professor B. Not only does she care about her students, but she's very passionate about everything she does and that passion/enthusiasm/excitement is contagious. She is truly an impressionable character. Fast paced but very clear. ASK QUESTIONS. She will not leave you behind.",1
Dr. Peck is amazing. He truly cares for students LEARNING and is willing to slow down and alter how he is teaching to accommodate that. If you have the chance to take a class with him TAKE IT you definitely won't regret it. He makes class enjoyable and interactive. I loved this class!!,1
Dr. Hill knows the material he teaches and teaches it well. He's very clear when you have online quizzes due and will send reminders. Don't text in his class or eat or drink in the classroom. He gives out chapter topic lists and lab term lists to help you when you study for tests. Online quizzes are on the test and you can review your answers.,1
"Dr. Koshevnik is overall a great teacher. He is accessible outside of class and will help reteach things to you if you don't understand. GO TO HIM BEFORE TESTS. He will let you know exactly what to expect for the test. He also lets you have a ""cheat card"" for the tests. Also, if you email him he always replies fast! DEFINITELY RECOMMEND HIS CLASS!",1
"Sommers is amazing. He makes the material easy to understand and keeps students engaged, a difficult task for a night class. He actually cares about his students and doesn't assign much work. One 5 page paper, 3 exams. Made a 3 hour night class much more bearable and would definitely recommend him to anyone who has to take a class he teaches.",1
The BEST professor ever! I am not a chemistry type of person but he made me love it because his lectures were very understandable. He's a funny guy and is always there for you to reach out to. People that give him bad reviews probably got a bad grade in the class. I'm not an easy learner. Reviews are kinda like the exams and offers extra credit.,1
Probably the best professor you will take at Baruch College as a political science major. Professor Tran presents the facts and teaches students to make objective and unbiased reviews about politics and government. Easy grader and always open to helping students. I took her 2x for both her lectures. Do it.,1
"His tests are tough, make sure you really study. His lectures contained a lot of material, and were live one day and recorded the other of the week. He took forever to respond to emails with questions. His weekly homework assignments were challenging. The lab reports are challenging, make sure you get a good group.",0
Avoid this man,0
This class was pretty much 100% independent study. The lectures were posted and expected to be completed before class including example problems. Classes then were announcements for tests and homework. Each day that homework is due there are two assignments that are long. Miss 4 of them and you fail. Total # HWs > 15.,0
Mark is an amazing Prof. Great to listen to in lecture and even better individually. Really helped guide me towards furhter education and provided a strong leadership role in the College. Irreplaceable professor and an all around nice guy!!! GREAT JOB MARK!!!,1
"I took this class 4 years ago, and I remember it being one of the worst classes of my life. All Clark does is barrel through the material, and it doesn't seem to matter to him if you are actually learning. Plus, he is extremely inaccessible.",0
"Professor Logan simplifies statistics and makes it very easy to succeed in his class, direct focus to excel assignments even though they are worth 20% all together they are extremely tricky. Weekly quizzes are tough but the final exam is open book and 70% of the questions can be answered by taking the table numbers and inputting them into excel.",1
"Don't take her. If I hadn't taken Physics in high school, I would not have passed. She does a horrible job at explaining things. I bought the textbook and have not opened it all semester. I was honestly only attending class for iClicker points, because I was teaching myself the material on the internet.",0
He does a lot of useless stuff in class. His lectures are extremely confusing. I went to a different prof's lectures because I needed to pass math 100.,1
"For a second year survery course, the course was way too specific.  She seemed to repeat the same points over and over.",0
"He gives a lot of tests, non mandatory homeworks and is a tough grader but he is a great teacher and is always willing to work with you",1
Taking him for fall semester at lbcc. Math 115 class which is a new class that is equivalent to math 130 ! And he is the worst math teacher  ever!!!!! He goes off subjeCT 85% of the time test are worrh50% of your grade! Study guides are a little helpful!  Not good at explaining problemsAT ALL its best to teach yourself or use mathlab  dont take him,0
He is very unorganized and is always changing his mind on things. I've learned more on about the class from the textbook than his lectures,0
Super nice lady! Jokes around alot.. Very helpful. If you go to class this class is super easy!,1
Online course was extremely difficult. Dr. Melendez was not available for any study sessions or help. No video lectures or meeting. He would unlock the week's chapter and you were on your own. Took several days to respond to emails.,0
"Hard to understand at times, my main problem was the lack of grading.",0
One of the worst teachers I have ever had. Took his research methods course and received no help at all. I basically taught the course to myself. He's way too self-absorbed with himself to care about his students. Don't think that taking an online course with him will be an easy way out-it's worse,0
"If you have to take Astronomy 25, don't take him",0
"Lots of homework. It helps you understand the material, but he doesn't actually teach it. He uses an online math book and there is a different teacher that actually teaches you the material.",0
I like jeff but the course is hard,0
"confusing questions, unclear expectations and unavailable. awful professor stay away from any classes he teaches",0
"He is funny, key word star trek... Anything syfy... You learn so much in such little amounts of time.. Also get ready for inquizitive.. I think people should learn how to use it before the class... I still dont know how to properly use it! Just stay tuned in, in class and have fun!",1
"This class is on you to learn entirely by yourself. Exams are about every 2-3 weeks and the powerpoints he posts dont help at all because he makes them so basic compared to the exams. Homework doesnt help your grade unless you dont do it, then it will drop your grade. If you are taking this with any other classes it will be hard to pass.",0
"Intimidated by him at first, but he grows on you quickly because he is so overwhelmingly supportive of you and wants you to succeed. There was a LOT of work, but I have never learned so much in a class. He was a fair grader and explains any mistakes you make. His class really prepares you for Soc270 & up! Hold on to the textbook, it helps later!",1
"He has the ability to be the best professor, but his attitude towards students and his rudeness already makes some of the hardest classes, harder. He is nasty in how he responds, refuses to help, and treats you like a moron, yet you don't get any other options.",0
The most boring professor I have ever taken. He is also like 70 and barely can use technology. He is also super paranoid about people using phones and laptops in class. He can be rude and annoying. Talks on and on about stuff that won't ever be on any tests.,0
"She is a good teacher, but her grading methods can either make you or break you. She grades you on your participation in class she make sure you talk. Her book analysis' are pretty easy and she has several readings throughout the semester. Her test are hard if you don't take good notes.",1
"i took him at winter and i know he was easier at winter than in the fall. i couldnt stand him as a person at all. arrogant, boring, & he doesnt even teach! he just rambles the whole class...dont take unless you have to",0
"Dr. Kunze is one of those profs you only ever hear about that inspire, motivate and encourage their students. I feel truly lucky to have had to opportunity to take a course with him. Do not pass up this chance if you have it. He will teach you so much and will go above and beyond to help AND get to know his students. AMAZING.",1
"I have taken multiple classes from Mrs. Henderson, I now try and pick classes that are not being taught by her. Its not that her classes are too hard its just that everything feels like busy work and she spends too much time during the lectures trying to talk about her personal life, oh and get ready for you email to be flooded with notifications.",0
"He will ask you to read the book before class, then at class time he will just restate what is in the book",0
"Ridiculously intelligent, but make sure you take all two years of the course or he'll hold it against you",0
not helpful. lets computer teach you. never sure when stuff due because you expected extended deadlines but then find out one person got and you didn't. I'm lost and taking different teacher next term.,0
"Avoid avoid!! This class was horrible! I wish I read the reviews before choosing this course. I failed both exams even though I did the study review. Only a handful of questions were actually on the test. George assigns 5 assignments to complete every week, it's impossible to keep up. Best advice: choose a different elective!!",0
CRAZY WOMAN BUT an easy teacher.,0
extremely hard to follow. fragile lecture content. escape as soon as possible.,0
extremely difficult tests,0
"Worst professor i've had in my 2 years at York. He doesn't teach, he rants. His teaching style is horrid and isn't clear at all. All he wants is people to memorize stuff to the tee. And yet the course has the word APPLICATIONS in it... not a math course that should be taught by him.",0
The levels of papers was ridiculous and the time given to work on said papers was never enough. I broke my ankle and was given one night to work on a 4-5 page paper for a class I missed (which I had a doctors note for). He clearly knows what hes talking about on the subject but is terrible at getting it across to his students.,0
His classes are quiet fun but he is very difficult to understand. Poor grading and unfair.,0
"Miller understands the material but doesn't teach very well. The class is mixture of rambling and rushing at the end to fit in examples that are ""crucial"" for the class. Miller goes over by 8 mins a day. Over all, I would not want to take a class with him again.",0
"Kirk is kind of entertaining, but he likes to call students out a lot. He is willing to help students after class, but he does not fully teach the material in class. He also does not give a lot of homework, but that is harmful in Calc II.",1
ABSOLUTELY UNREALISTIC EXPECTATIONS OF HER STUDENTS. GOD FORBID YOU HAVE A PROBLEM IF YOU DO KEEP IT TO YOURSELF. WAS GETTING AN A IN HER COURSE UNTIL I HAD AN ISSUE NOW SHE RIPS ALL MY WORK APART AND GIVES POOR GRADES FOR THE SAME WORK I WAS GETTING A's FOR PRIOR. IF YOU GET STUCK WITH HER CHANGE IT IMMEDIATELY!!!!!!!,0
"He's the kind of guy that makes a significantly weighted online quiz due at 5:30 PM and not midnight. Tests are confusing (no clear answer, need exact textbook definitions)",0
"Your entire grade in her class is 100 points. Total. Each class you miss she deducts 5 points of your grade REGARDLESS of circumstance. If you take this class, my best advice is don't miss it. It's pointless at times because she just puts you into groups and if you got decent people you just talk for the rest of the class. Don't take it.",0
"Classes were kind of boring, but she is a good teacher. Liberal.",1
"Im currently taking her classes online and let me tell you, I couldnt be more confused. She replies quickly but not enough material to help you understand it. Just a couple of videos and turn in work that you arent sure if you did correctly. Recommend you take a teacher online that provides a lot of sources online to help you master the class.",0
"Dr. Cook is clearly extremely intelligent and therefore her lectures can be very hard to follow, as she does not simplfy language often. The tests are very specific and difficult, but luckily there's a really big curve typically. The book and readings are all very interesting. The lectures are unengaging, so full attention is needed.",0
"Overall Fulford is ok guy, but this class was brutal. Should have been named comparative linguistics, not Anth of Language. Fulford was very unorganized and I'd question if he even liked teaching this class. You need to keep a dictionary handy for his essays. Not very clear directions. Beware his translation exercises!",0
he is the best professor at Fsu. if you have the opportunity to take this class with him do it. he is funny and works with you and is super easy to reach and accessible.,1
Do not take this man! I think he is the worst teacher I've had at MSU so far. He gives quizes every week that are pretty much cover only the readings in the book are are very hard. He scribbles things on the board and explains them horribly. When he replaced Schell (after his stroke) lots of people dropped. I'm just praying I pass this class.,0
I wish saw the reviews before taking his class The quizzes he gives are easy but a waste of time because they have anything to do with what you will be tested on in the final exam The problems he goes over are not the ones on the tests that the math dept makes so it is obvious he isn't teaching all the questions we need to know Waste of money,0
"Great Class, Great Professor",1
"Dr. Kass seems like a heartless professor at first, but his grading procedures are very fair and generous. You'd have to try pretty hard to fail. You won't pass his class without putting the work in, though. If you go see him for office hours he will walk you through whatever you're stuck on and practically give you the answers. Great professor!",1
he is brilliant and updates his study guides often. helped me through mcat studying. Updating the study guides helped me with self-discipline and studying more efficiently. def recommend!,0
"She is one of the nicest professors I've had. She teaches well and is clear on what is due and what is expected. Basically, if you do the relatively small and easy assignments in and out of class, you will pass. You probably won't need to read the textbook except when studying for the midterm.",1
"seems disorganised makes bad jokes and will make simple concepts difficult to understand as he has a way of teaching that seems like he is trying to show off how much smarter he is than everyone else. Will not post notes or HW solutions, tests can be easy",0
"Caused me to drop the course. I love Ethics, and this was my chance to take a seminar, but it was impossible to understand what he was trying to teach. He really ought to retire.",0
No great at explaining things and isn't accessible outside of class. Told me if my group members didn't respond to do the group project by myself? while everyone else in the class does 1/3 the work? Also talks super slow in lecture its painstaking. Classmates and myself state feeling unprepared and confused on just about everything.,0
"I thought he was a horrible teacher. The class would ask questions that everyone was confused about and all he would do in return is yell and get frustrated you don't understand everything he puts down. Paying close to a thousand dollars you should feel comfortable asking for help, this is not the case with this teacher",0
"This class is seriously an easy A! she is a great professor. Do the homework, make sure you write the questions down, and study the hw/quiz questions and you will do good! take advantage of SI... she puts the information you need right in front of you and offers extra credit! Seriously a great class!",1
"Dr. Stelzer is definately a better teacher than preacher. His class is REALLY EASY. I could have passed it with my ears sealed shut. You can memorize the notes or memorize the chapter of scripture the test is over and you will ace the test! Nice guy! I didn't learn a whole lot from the class, but I've heard he's better in Heb. & James",1
She is very liberal. Constantly talking about Karl Marx. (His economic theories are a joke theyve never worked) she grades tests down to your definition being so exact with hers or its a 0. Same with homeworks. You can have the right answer & concept. and shell mark it wrong. Class average on 1st test was a 61% thats a failure on her part imo,0
"Professor White responds to my emails with questions with ""no problem."" and my inquiries as to why I got a grade and how I can do better with, ""keep doing the work and maybe that will help."" Don't expect her to communicate with you, she also sends these replies 5 days to a week later. Exams require lockdown browser. Some coursework on quizlet.",0
"The best math professor I've taken at UNT, and as a math major, I've had plenty of them. Show up to class, take notes, do all the homework problems, go over your notes each day, and you'll get an A. Tests are straighforward. If you can do the homework, you can do the tests. He's extremely generous with partial credit.  Cannot recommend him enough.",1
"One of the top two professors I've had at UD.  He is helpful, flexible, clear, brilliant, insightful, and wants you to succeed.  Class is interesting and makes you want to attend.  Assignments are frequent, but short and managable.  If you have to take an English class, take Brueckner.",1
Prof. Tucker is so sweet understanding and understands communications throughly. She keeps up to date with current forms of communications so well!!,1
Lacks clarity... only teaches through examples... not theory,0
"Easiest Professor at Grand Valley.  Take Fishback if you don't like going to class but like getting A's.  Nice guy too, terrible sense of humor though.",1
Hard grader.  Often goes off on a tangent and wastes class time.  Would not recommend.,0
The worse teacher in history. Don't ever in your life take this professor he is the worse thing that happened to me. By the way im trying hard not to curse while im typing please dont ever take this class and vote for him to not be a teacher. TERRIBLE TEACHER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,0
Stay away if you want to pass,0
"One of the best professors I've had, especially since we transitioned online because of the pandemic. Very accessible by email and office hours. Great lectures and wants to help students understand the concept. The test and subject itself isn't easy, and his tests do challenge you. However, if you put in the effort, it's a very rewarding class.",1
He's not good at teaching on how to write a paper.,0
"Probably the worst prof I have ever had the misfortune of taking. His jokes became repetitive after two classes. His personal stories, which half the time sound made up, take up most of class and offer nothing about the content. I had him for two classes and each time, I dreaded going because it was a waste of time.",0
"The only way I got an A in the class is by completing every extra credit opportunity possible.  You will get pages of Emails every week. You will be asked to watch hours of online lectures. You will NOT do well on his tests. You will spend hours and hours outside of class working on your project, so make sure that you like everyone in your group.",0
"Rebecca is hands down the best instructor at COCC. She knows what it takes for a student to actually learn the information from the course, and she teaches in a way that is engaging, contemporary, and fun. She makes it seem like we're all learning together and like we could all just be friends and have conversations about sociology. Take her class!",1
"Dr. L clearly knows all the material, just doesn't know how to teach it and make it understandable to college students. All class, every class, you are to frantically take note page after page, while trying to comprehend the terms, graphs, formulas, etc that he is trying to throw at you. Very difficult to understand, barely passed with a C-",0
Very enthusiastic professor. One of the best lecturers I've ever have. ,1
"Dr. MS is awesome, but he gives exams in pdf format so that all of his students are taking the same version of the test. Because of cheating, the averages are very high. Despite this, he hasn't changed the exam format, he has just made his exams harder. Unfortunately, it is more difficult for honest students to do well in his class this semester.",1
Blanchard teaches in metaphors. weekly homework assignments. The tests are hard but if you read the book and study they are doable. Don't take him for lab. Feel free to ask questions during lecture if things are not clear. Sarcastic guy. Very smart. ,1
"Side note: Besides midterm and final, there is the requirement of attending 2 concerts of your approved choice and writing reports for them. BUT the ""concert report"" consists of a handout with questions to answer (in detail, of course). That's all for homework besides studying.",1
Avoid at your own cost.,0
"Good at teaching, however her class is un-bearable.",0
Sweet person. She grades hard on papers so do them well in advance and/or look over them thoroughly. Some of the material is boring and some is really interesting. She is really invested in students doing well. Overall interesting class but a decent challenge.,1
The class is sorta boring and you really need to pay attention to grasp whats going on. Tests are almost identical to practice but the final was pretty tough.,0
"He's intelligent, but to the point of arrogance that gets in the way of teaching you the material. He makes you feel extremely dumb for asking questions and tends to be highly discouraging. I wouldn't recommend taking this course with him.",0
"havent gotten my grade, ut he is very opinionated about the arab-israeli conflict and takes a side. for those students who are trying to learn for the first time about this, he will give you a false intro to the sitation. hamas is moderate?",1
HHHHARD EXAM,0
"She was enjoyable during the beginning. Later on, she became very rude to other students and was often late for grading. She made multiple promises to students but never upheld until EVERYONE started to complain. The workload was fine and you can honestly pull an all-nighter to finish everything.",0
"Honestly one of the worst profs Ive had. Extremely boring and using most of class time for unecessary discussion time between students. Feels like there isnt enough criteria for her to teach, so she needs to fill the time through wasting it. Beware of pop quizzes. She is also very very hard to understand, regardless of how slow she talks. Quiet.",0
"Orser is a lovely woman, however, she is way too tough of a marker and not active online through moodle, feedback was less to none. I think everybody failed one quiz and expects you to read all books ( which are expensive) while having a full courseload and life",0
If you want to do well in this course you have to dedicate your entire term just to this one course and nothing else.,0
"He was the best professor I have ever had! He's very funny, and he always successfully engages his students. He's very understanding if you need extensions or extra clarification. Lectures aren't necessary to attend, but he is the best lecturer the University has to offer. I will take anything offered by him in the future! I recommend this class! ",1
Way too much work and reading for a 200 level class. He expects his students to do way more work than should be expected for a class at this level. He is very opinionated & seems to make personal vendettas against students who voice opposing thoughts. Anyone who thinks for themselves rather than just saying what the professor wants should stay away,0
Very poor attitude towards students. Weighting of material on test was very unfair. Students were given the opportunity to give feedback after the test. Dr. Balshine was only willing to listen to positive comments and when anyone made a negative comment (true and valid) about something she had done she rudely shot them down and ignored this input,0
"Don't let this 100 level course fool you! Lecture power points are VERY confusing. Test questions are very tricky and confusing. Dr. Nochera had to leave half way through the semester, and Professor house took over. TAKE PROFESSOR HOUSE! Her exams were so much easier, tests were straightfoward, her class is an easy A.",0
"He is sooo bad. Simply reads the slides in class without explaining anything. When you ask him, he looks so angry and looks like you are bothering him. Overall, you realize you can only rely on yourself the entire time. 1/3 students show up in class usually. Feels like I've wasted my time and tuition fee. There could be better profs but not him.",0
I learned very little from Professor Danaher that I did not already know or have studied. He need new matrial and certainally a different and innovative approach. I would not recommend this course to anyone unless they took it off the Nyack campus.,0
"Good professor who is very knowledgable about Middle East/US foreign policy. The class is two papers and three exams, all of which are take home and directly connected to the class material. Definitely would recommend taking him for a GOV312L credit, some of the other gov professors are significantly harder.",1
Easily the worst professor I have had so far. His lectures do nothing with his exams and he has no interest on trying to help you learn the material if you don't get it.  If you care about your grade do not take this professor.,0
"DO NOT TAKE for BUS4500!!!! He does not explain grading criteria, he does not prepare you for exams whatsoever, he barely lectures (usually YouTube videos), and he does NOT care if you struggle in the class. He gives 3 exams and you do a last-minute, poorly explained, group project. Oh AND he will mark you wrong but not explain the correct answer.",0
Her lectures are a regurgitation of the textbook. Instead of explaining proofs she writes duh on the board and moves very fast through material. Tests are extremely hard and she encourages people to withdraw. The only way to do well in this class is if you have seen this material before. This is my 4th math class at Duke & by far the worst.,0
Do yourself a favour and dont take any of her classes. She doesnt respond to emails and cancels classes before the exam. Her tests are insanely difficult with no correlation to her boring lectures. AVOID AVOID AVOID. Went to lectures and did the reading and still could barely finish her exams. AVOIDDDDD,0
"While there's no doubt this man is an absolute pro at what he does, his genius might be his strongest weakness especially during lecture. Notes he gives are very extensive, but he will usually skip steps because he will infer you know what's happening, making you more lost and confused the longer lecture goes on. I learned about everything online",0
"terrible professor, very unprofessional and mean. doesn't tell you exactly what he wants. don't recommend him",0
His lectures are extremely engaging and interesting. He is a caring professor and his lectures are well prepared. Highly recommend this course.,1
HORRIBLE PROFESSOR! AVOID IF YOU CAN. THERE'S NOT MUCH ELSE TO SAY!,0
"Spent literally 10 hours in total on this course online and got an A, course material is pretty difficult to understand, almost to the point where it's pointless to read it. His tests are really easy and he just uses the material he posted online. The study guide is apparently where all the questions come from but I didn't bother using it. Sigh.",0
Don't even bother with this professor... if you struggle with math don't take her.,0
"Too Fast, Too Boring, Too Lazy",0
Don't take him. Worst profesor ever! 3 weeks to hit finals and the only thing I learn was football. I'm so disappointed.,0
"Horrible, more interested in where you put a comma than if you got anything from the assignment. Question if he reads the papers or just looks for MINOR grammatical errors. Tests so long you can barely finish. He talks to fast to take notes and then reads long quotes that are needless. ""A"" student that may pull a low B. ",0
Really cares about his class and the material covered.,1
"Eberle amazes me with his knowledge of Shakespeare in every class session. He presents the material in an exciting format and he's constant changing it up with videos, lecture, group work, and projects.",1
"Professor Dynes has been one of my favorite professors at BYU. He is empathetic, engaging, and finds unique ways to apply complex topics to everyday scenarios, making the content of the class accessible and enjoyable. He is simply a good person. The reading and lectures are imperative to succeeding in the course, but dont let that dissuade you!",1
"Its clearly obvious he knows his material, however he is unclear with his criteria from the book report to the exams, power points have nothing to do with exams, he is also too busy talking about how he runs from cheetahs and had a hard life as a student, and things are easier for students now. Cant escape him he is the only one who teaches 301/302",0
"LITERALLY the hardest grader I have ever had in my life, knocks off points for every single grammar error, every assignment is at least 300 words, PLEASE just avoid if you can.",0
"He's not as bad as people make him out to be. He has a dry teaching style, but he is very understanding. I think he is a nice teacher.",1
She's amazing. Keeps class engaging and fun. Do yourself a favor and take a course with this woman.,1
"TAKE HIM IF YOU CAN!! Hands down the best professor I have had at state. Inspirational, awesome person, cares about his students. Writing assigned every week but its not hard, go to office hours at Starbucks and he will tell you exactly what you need to do to get an A on a paper. 110% would recommend!",1
Really wants his students to succeed,1
"Make sure to show up to every class. Attendance gets 10 points off every time you miss class, are on your phone, etc. Tests are straightforward and little work outside class is needed. Lectures are super fun and interesting. Dr. Knox makes things fun and relatable to students.",1
"I am so happy I took this Technology and Organizational Strategy course with Ken! He did make us all work A LOT, but it was group work, doing cases. Very practical, challenging and useful for an MBA. Ken is passionate and will teach you, unlike many ""easy"" profs who let you just pass through the course with little skills and knowledge retained",1
"Dr. Too is the worst professor I have ever had, he does not care about his students at all. He only cares about teaching the material and that's it. He does not care if you are struggling in the course at all. He teaches the material and that's about it.",0
"A great prof who tried her best to keep class engaging. Well organized notes, which were posted online. Assignments and seminar questions were similar to those on the midterms and final.",1
most sweet and nice proffessor ever,1
Horrible Professor. Not willing to help at all.,0
"Professor Swift is friendly and clear about his expectations. His videos explains things well. This was a basic course and I should have done better. It was more on me, not on him. I would take him again.",1
"Did not learn anything from her. Nasty, and incompetent. This semester was mainly online. Many times, I felt bad that I had no chance to meet our good teachers. For this teacher, I feel lucky I do not have to have classes with her. She is young, maybe she will improve. Take some courses of tolerance and understanding. Some English will help, too.",0
Larry is very passionate and makes the class an experience. I did not find the material overly hard and with limited studying could pull high marks. I did get tired of his attitude. He is a bit full of himself.,1
"There are a lot of readings to do and they are slightly boring, but they are managable. There are three tests and they are relatively easy if you are familiar with the material. There are two writing assignments that are both a three page maximum that are pretty easy. Also, if you complete 80% of the topcoat question you get an overall 1% bonus!",1
"Great professor, he is a chilled guy and very nice and caring to students! I like the way he lectures. If you are not focused you still can understand what he is talking about! There is a book about critical thinking and a novel which is not bad to read! Essays aren't bad just keep it at the minimum. Overall take him",1
I have never met a more self-absorbed professor in my life. He believes his way of teaching is the best despite the high fail rate of his classes caused by nobody being able to understand his lectures. Your only hope of passing this class is to study on your own time from the study guide and recommended questions. Don't even bother going to class.,0
"Mr. Freda seems to have a bad rep, but don't let him or this class scare you. You have to put in some effort and he'll notice if you do. Some test questions can be tricky, but this class is meant to make you think about the concepts. Don't skip class if you can help it... you'll be glad. I'm not a science-y person but I learned a lot of cool stuff!",1
"Marcy is super smart.  She's willing to help, but sometimes the help just made things more confusing.  Don't wait until the last minute to do  the homework  and final project, they are too overwhelming. ",1
He is  a funny professor who cusses all the time. He will say the F word in almost every lecture class. He's a cool fun teacher but he's not very good at teaching this class. It's hard to understand the stuff and his teaching doesn't make it easier. It's hard to follow his lectures. He's a cool guy but he just can't teach this class.,0
"Embry is a really funny teacher and has so much fun with his job. You can tell he is passionate about English and that makes it so much more interesting to be in class. However, there is a ton of reading and he doesn't assign page numbers so get ready to read a lot.",1
"Had her for Social Informatics Fall 2020, absolutely loved her! Work was mainly just discussions and readings, midterm was an essay, and final was a group project that wasn't bad at all. She's super understanding and a light grader, really loved the class and the stuff she taught, she never made class difficult at all!",1
"Really great teacher, makes the entire class laugh at least once a week. He treats us as equals and expects the same from you :)",1
"Effective teacher if you are a math major. However, his motivation tactics are to disrespect the student's intelligence and work ethic. The man insulted us every class. Rarely will ever build you up. I found his general demeanor towards students discouraged asking questions in class. You can get an A if you prioritize this class and ignore others.",0
"Best teacher I have ever had.  He actually made me work hard and feel good about acomplishing projects.  Its a difficult class if you don't put your effort into it, but if you try and pay attention, he'll get you to learn UNIX easily. (I got an A.) Aside from him being notorious for being a hard-ass, he's actually a great big sweetheart.",1
"Dr. Sundahl is brilliant, extremely knowledgeable, very fun, & kind. I don't think he's arrogant;he just really doesn't care about impressing anyone anymore. He teases relentlessly, but just tease back. Try to grasp the ideas, & ask if you don't get it. Go to his office, he's great to talk to and really cares about his students. He's hard but fair.",1
He's pretty awesome and obviously cares strongly about his students and what he does. His lectures can be slightly dry but he is very knowledgeable and can simplify things as well.,1
"She isn't the best at explaining the material, but she is very willing to answer questions.",1
Yes this subject is hard but this teacher made it very difficult to pass. No feedback why 0 points were given when answers mirrored lecture material. Very disappointing that some professors make things harder than need be and make students feel discouraged.,0
"Please do yourself a favor and stay away from her. She will ruin your grade for one research paper even if you had a good grade, she will drop your grade based on how she wants to grade the paper even if you follow her directions ""explicitly"", she will still mark you down. Do not recommend her to anyone.",0
"Jamie is one of the worst professors I have ever had. She is hopelessly repetitive, completely uninformative, and vague with expectations. She is also incredibly rude and condescending. Her grading is based on whether or not she ""feels"" you are trying hard, not your actual work. The is no actual dog handling in the course.",0
"Took this class Distence Education.  Textbook is absolutely horrid and dry...material is boring as hell.  Also, no communication with the prof at all, and assignment questions were vague.  Take this class only if it's mandatory.",0
"She is horrible. 90% of the classes are spent in unrelated discussions. She waits until the last minute of class to tell us important info, so we end up staying late. She tells you to learn about how to write your paper by reading about it. She is extremely difficult about grammar. She marks off for every tiny thing she can find wrong.",0
Terrible terrible terrible... avoid if at all possible,0
"Franko is an overall good professor.  His major flaw is clarity.  However, he is always willing to help and repeat what is necessary for all students to understand.  This is a tough course and there is a lot of material to learn.  That being said, as long as you put in the work and reach out to Franko when you need help, you will do fine!",1
"She's a nice person and her lectures are super easy to follow, but they are the most boring thing ever. I barely passed the class because I kept zoning out and could not force myself to focus. She's accessible outside of class but it's just so DULL. Lots of homework, but your grade is based pretty much on your tests only.",1
"All of Morrison's lectures are complete BS. He just rambles about very common-sense traits that leaders posses (i.e. leaders are charismatic). I can't believe this is a college class. The class is very easy, but there is so much stupid busy work and it's sooo boring. I would say take it just because it's so easy but be ready for useless busy work.",0
I got an A in this class but what is the deal with her?  I don't need a prof who has to learn along with me this much.,0
"This class has been really helpful in my professional life. I thank all the exercises he asked to be done, because a class like this requires them to be mastered. One of the best classes I have ever had.",1
Pretty solid professor for Systems Analysis. Overall the class isn't too difficult. The first half of the semester is pretty frontloaded with a lot of work but it's so you can work on your final project. Would take again.,1
"This lady does not know how to cut any slack. She wants things done precisely with no room for error every time, and she tends to set unrealistic and frustrating deadlines.",0
"I had her for Financial Accounting, she was a great choice. I know other classes had more resources, but she covers the content we needed several times, so if you pay attention in class you should be good. She is really strict about people being late so try not to walk in after she has started.",1
"This was an online class. She stated she would respond to e-mails within 24 hrs. She never responded to one all semester, never responded to any message board posts either. Took a long time to grade project as well.",0
It is in your best interest to avoid this professor at all cost. She has a freakish obsession with William Wordsworth and grades on a bias. Redundant with material in class.,0
"Only teaching done was teaching myself! Twice made references and expectations of being a 300 class.  Rude comments with very little actual feedback!(example: highlighted paragraph and wrote, what is this?) I paid for a professor, what I got was a JOKE!  Avoid him at all costs!! Other kids taking Engl 250  couldn't believe how hard   he was.",0
"If you have a difficultly grabbing concepts in oil omg math, Dont take Mathi. She knows what she is talking about, and is understanding, but does little to help you. And she will rush most of the book the last few weeks of the quarter. Prepare to teach yourself or have a tutor.",0
He teaches the concept well. Tests are fair but the exams are EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. You cant find the exam questions in the book. AVOID this guy if you can. Take PHYS 1410/1420 it's easier to get B or higher,0
"This professor is good, nuff said.  Especially if the sheriff were a dog! you'll understand this and more when you become enlightened by taking one of his classes.",1
"It's basically one of those classes where as long as you do your work, you should be fine. It's not all that difficult of a class.",1
"Pretty funny guy.  advisor for ASME, so if you're interested in that, get to know him.  very happy to help if you show that you put forth effort in his class.  Tests are hard.",1
A lot of people will tell you he's confusing but from my experience it was because people in the class didnt let him teach before interrupting the lesson to ask inane questions or ask about a later part of the chapter. Homework and notes help. Tests are the most weight as far as grade. Listen to understand and you will do fine,1
"I took Dan's class in 2018-2019, best professor ever. Was very helpful. He does not skip steps, very through with his work. I miss his class.",1
4 Exams and 1 Research Project. Project is easy and can probably be completely fabricated. He grades the project fair. The Exams are all multiple choice but optional essays at end if you're not confident in multiple choice. Hard to pay attention to in lecture but not his fault. Read the book or listen to every word he says should get decent grade,1
"Dr. Brewer is the absolute best, and I am so glad I didn't take this class with anyone else. The material is pretty challenging, and Dr. Brewer really cares about her student's success. There is some extra credit opportunities which I highly recommend taking advantage of. If you take UC2, take it with Dr. Brewer, and get to know her.",1
"I've taken 2 classes with Professor Wheeler and I absolutely love her and her teaching style. This isn't another boring history with memorization, it will make you think critically about history. The TA's are also very helpful in and out of class. Attendance is mandatory though.",1
"Professor Pitney is awesome in class- beyond intelligent, humorous, and genuinely wants participation. No tests, only papers. Very specific in what style of writing he wants.",1
"hard and rash professor, I event think he's ****, does not help at all, condescending, and rude, study a lot if you are minority, in order to get good grade.",0
"Very tough grader....grades came from only 3 tests and they were extremly hard...does not curve at all...notes are taken directly from his mouth, and he talks too fast and has an accent so its hard to understand...studied a lot but still did not do well..",0
"Hes a great professor & offers LOTS of extra credit opportunities. There are group presentations but you dont really have to meet outside of class. You can use GroupMe to contact each other, plus you get some time to discuss in class. Its lecture heavy, but that was a given considering I took this class in the summer. Would DEFINITELY take again",1
Dr. Hilts is an awesome chem prof! He doesn't intimidate you when you ask him questions. Chemisty is easier with him! You ask him questions via email and he answers it right away! Mastering chem deadlines are also not stressful. He does everything to make his students excel! Very good prof!,1
I switched my major to marketing because Maria made the class that awesome. I wish I could have her teach all of my classes. You can tell she's really passionate about her students and she really wants everyone to learn. Take her!!,1
Prof. Woulas was very fair with grading. He is willing to help make sure you pass the class. Just complete your homework assignments on math lab and do the quizzes and study for the 4 tests and your golden.,1
Challenging class but incredibly fun! I felt like I was learning so much. The concepts you learn are applicable to the real world and the professor cares so much about what he does. It is difficult for sure but he gives great examples. Asking questions is important and if he doesn't cover something you can typically find it easily in the textbook.,1
"2 homework assignments due every week, one was multiple choice video questions (super easy points) and the second was actual math questions on connect. The second assignment is how I learned all the material for the exams. The exams are a mix of questions you can get online and problems you actually have to work out. He truly wants you to do well.",1
"good teacher overall, kind of a pushover. doesn't care if you stroll in late and catches you up if you are. 3 hard essays, but other than that it's just activities from the textbook and occasional copy-and-paste quiz. i'd take him for a B you might work a bit for.",1
This professor is so awful my rating couldn't fit within this post. So here is the summary - Ego bigger than Jeff Bezos' net worth - Must buy access to HIS BOOK & HIS WEBSITE + tuition - Has a kink for catching cheaters - Will belittle you - Awful response times - Inconsistent quiz answer keys and questions - not fun pastebin DOT COM rddAQaM4,0
Homework isnt bad and the web assign isnt required.,1
"She is a very sweet professor who is looking out for the best in everyone and always wants to help if she can. Sometimes, it does feel like we are treated as if we aren't in college, but these introductory music classes also have that sense to begin with. She provides a lot of help and gives a lot of feedback on quizzes. She is a great professor!",1
"She really needs a marking rubric or something that the student can use to figure out what they need to include to get full marks, every assignment with her felt like a guessing game and because the course has many small 1% assignments if she felt you didn't meet what she wanted it was a 0/1, these small 0% scores can add up by the end.",0
"Cannot be reached by email. She ignores your questions in class, and moves way too quickly. Does not seem to care about her students. She also locks the door directly after class starts. I remember a student attempted to come in 2 minutes late and she laughed and said ""should we leave him out there?""",0
"Dr. Angell is a very intelligent man who loves the content, but he is the worst professor I have ever had. He is condescending when asked questions. He is a very tough grader. He REFUSES to curve a test even when the average is a failing grade. He has the hardest exams I had ever taken. Take this class at washtenaw for your mental health.",0
"Her experience with development really adds to the class. She does have a standard, but it isn't unreachable. She is a great resource to the poli sci department. Sad to hear she might be going to American though /:",1
"Professor Hess was pretty okay. She doesn't use titanium, so when we had to switch to virtual is was unorganized. Her lectures seemed to have no real structure to them. If you have a friend who can proofread your papers, it will make the class easier. but beware of her tough grading.",1
"Very good professors. Lectures can be a little all over the place, but quizzes are online. Make sure you stay on top of discussions, this will be mainly what you get graded on. Overall a good science credit, and very interesting.",1
The worst experience I had so far at Hunter!,0
did you know he went to Princeton??????,0
The online class 'Intro to Islamic Civilization' was an absolute mess; quiz questions were from material not yet covered or material that was never covered and the prof tries way too hard to be funny. I really feel that I learned almost nothing from this class and online the prof does not look as hot as some have previously posted,0
"Tomi is wonderful! Very fun to listen to as well! Alabma Stories, Woohoo! Your education at UTM is not complete until you have Tomi! You should hear her sing Sweet Home Alabama.",1
"The class was very interesting but his lectures got pretty confusing and felt rushed. And his tests were absolutely impossible. There is no final, which is bittersweet because you need to do well on the 3 tests given during the semester. But there was a TON of extra credit available which boosted my grade from a deserving C+/B- to an A-.",1
"Had her for my FYS, and she was the toughest grader Ive ever and will ever have during my time at Marist. Freshmen, if you read this, STAY CLEAR from this FYS. She will rip every paper apart and take points off for the stupidest things. And her tests were insanely hard as well. Avoid at all costs.",0
"I think she could explain things a little better, but other than that she's a great teacher. She tries hard to make sure that everyone understands the material. Having a background in music is very helpful for this class and makes it a ton easier.",1
"A very nice guy with a lot of knowledge but the class was too difficult for a 100 level. Take home midterm, which was nice, and the final exam was open note. However, a 15pg. research paper was over kill. The amount of reading assigned, while not nessecary, was too much. His lectures aren't structured and sometimes hard to follow.",0
"Good Teacher.  He get kind of confused during lecture but really tries to get the material across.  Book was hardly used.  Just take good notes and you'll do fine.  The class goes over bash, bash scripting, python, php and git.  Two programming projects, around 10 hws, two midterms and a final.  He's the best teacher to take 254 with",1
She is an amazing professor. I had her for Engl comp 2 and it's a research class she understands that research isn't the most interesting thing in the world and tries to make it fun. For most of the assignments pick something you're passionate about and the class won't be hard.,1
"This is hands down the worst professor I have ever taken a class with. Please heed my advice and don't listen to the other reviews and get fooled like I did. Maybe at one time Jeff was a good teacher, but now, I wouldn't even call him a teacher because he does. not. teach. He drones on about irrelevant things & tells people their OPINIONS are wrong",0
"He is a great professor, and goes into depth with his lectures. Just make sure you read the assigned chapters and the class will be a piece of cake.",1
"WORST PROFESSOR. SHOULD BE FIRED IMMEDIATELY. THE fact he is still a professor makes me reevaluate my decision on coming to University of Tampa. Very unreasonable. if you have to take him, take the class another semester with another professor. Information is not understanding the concept by memorizing random things from the book ...",0
Really vague expectations for assignments and essays. Hardest class I've taken at UCR so far.,0
this guz shows Flash Gordon movies in a writing class!  I came to college to learn how to write not how to watch old movies.,1
"Dr. T means well but expects so much from her students and grades very harshly/unreasonably. Speeches must be PERFECT under her standards in order to get an A, very subjective grading. Overall not a terrible class, but not the best teacher for it.",1
"This class, while not too interesting was made up for the fact that she is an AMAZING professor.  Lots of great stories and is very thoughtful i f you have comments or anything about the class.  If you get a chance, take a class taught by her.",1
"Boring, very absent minded, talks to himself",0
"Great professor. The only reason I failed his class is because I'm stupid. He has 6 quizzes, which contain problems straight from the homework. I didn't do my homework, so I didn't do well. However, he drops the lowest two quizzes. You will also have to memorize three proofs of calculus theorems. It's not as bad as you think.",1
Professor Davis was remarkable. She is very understanding and maintains communication throughout the entire course. Constantly sends reminders to submit assignment. Three papers and discussion forums that lead to great dialogue among the class. She truly motivates you and will provide you a incredible alternative outlook on the political society!,1
Will learn  a lot,1
"awesome prof...the course is BBBBBOOOORRRRIIINNNGGGG....its hell to sit through because you would rather be sleeping, but hes a great prof. and always willing to help, and the WebCT for that course is always well organized and updated",1
he is very sweet but most of the interaction and grading goes through the TAs. i had trouble registering for a class of his for next semester and he was very helpful. his lectures are fun and interesting.,1
This guy was great!  I didn't know much about networking but he did a good job teaching me what I needed to know.  Came in early to help me get through a few tough topics. ,1
Has made me cry multiple times. Avoid at all costs if you are not willing to make this class your first priority.,0
"This class is absolutely terrible. He does not teach the material well enough and does not care if students succeed in his class. His tests are impossible. I am a good student and receive good grades, but his class just about killed me.",0
"So I took her online for Art 101 and I'll admit, it was a pain. Her class is straight forward with weekly assignments but I just think she assigns too many quizzes and writing assignments and the lecture takes forever to read. Her grading is understanding. I just think its unnecessary that she makes us take a test and write 3 essays every month.",0
"Professor Bartz-Smith is super awesome and really wants her students to pass. This was a lab, so attendance is important. The lab manual is free (provided by her on BB). She does post quizzes on blackboard, but they are not difficult if you paid attention in class. The final practical was not as hard as it sounds as long as you prepare for it!",1
"This professor thinks that he knows everything but he just has little knowledge about the antenna. He is very proud and arrogant. He does not care about the students. If you go to his office and asks him a question instead of answering you, he starts to ask some questions and then he told you that to go out because in his opinion you are not eligi",0
"Best professor I've had at Haverford. Will challenge you, but also introduce you to a new way of interpreting texts. He is by far one of the English Department's best assets.",1
"He has a terrible Russian accent which makes understanding him near impossible. His writing is illegible which makes the notes almost useless. Along with he doesn't explain anything so you have to self teach yourself the material. Also, there is no calculator use. DON'T TAKE THIS PROFESSOR.",0
I'll honestly never take a class with this professor again. She is rude and if you ever correct her so other students don't get behind from the mistake... she gets super hateful. And if you opt out of training sessions (even when she says that's ok) she will ridicule you because you didn't go if you get one thing wrong. The work load wasn't bad tho,0
She is a great teacher that wants everyone to do well.  The class is really interesting and it's not hard at all.,1
She doesnt know how to lecture and she definitly cannot write,0
"Dr. Kinney is absolutely amazing. He's the best professor I've had a CMU so far,and is very into the subject. He's also a great adviser for the youth studies major. Loved the class! Just make sure you read the books!",1
"He does not seem to care about the students at all, or if they pass the class. The first day he said ""You guys can drop if you want to, I get paid either way."" A teacher is supposed to want you to succeed in their class and he certainly did not care. Hes seemed to have a sense of humor,but it was hard to tell if he was joking or really didn't care",0
He is a terrible teacher. He cops attitudes when you ask a question and reads from a projector the whole time. when you are still confused off his wrong answer all he can assume is you didnt read. Young and fresh out of college not ready to be a professor!,0
Assigns very interesting readings and makes finance intriguing,1
"WORST PROF I'VE HAD YET!!! 0/10, would not recommend. Summarizes textbook & reads off slides in lecture, awful midterms (unnecessarily complicated), and terrible teaching skills! seems more interested in getting students to memorize textbook examples than actually understanding concepts. Do not take a class with this prof! ",0
"This could be the worst professor on campus. She has no leniency so anything late is a 0. She makes you read out of a pointless textbook on a weekly basis, and then asks questions on quizzes that do not relate. This teacher is terrible and I highly recommend that you do no take this teacher, every other public speaking teacher is better than her",0
This Professor has an ego issue. Everything about this class is subjective especially the virtual part. Lots of dumb group work. And for a MANAGEMENT class they are not that organised.,0
"Had him at Ryerson a few years ago but there is no profile for him there. Terrible professor. Pompous, arrogant, bad attitude towards students. Spends a lot of time name-dropping to inflate his already large ego. Don't take his classes, they're awful.",0
"She doesn't lecture so much as read slides as she stares at her shoes. Despite being asked on multiple occasions by the class to use a microphone, she continued to just mumble quietly so no one could hear. Seemed to have no idea what was going on.",0
Terrible! He is truly all over the place with his ideas and thoughts. His exams do not relate to the lecture or the readings. And why does he make us watch a movie about CORN?!(great nap time though),0
"Dr. Ruse is an amazingly brilliant professor.  He almosts makes me want to switch majors.  His essay questions are tough, but he's a great guy.  Lectures are great...has a hilarious sence of humor.  If your looking for a breeze through, this isnt your class, but if you give him a chance, he will teach you a ton of stuff.  Great class.",1
"Very helpful teacher.  Was nervous about talking in front of people, he made it a lot easier and more comfortable.  Highly recommend to anymore that is nervous about taking speech.  Great Prof.",1
He is the most useless teacher I have ever had. He may as well signed hi paychecks over to me because I taught myself Cost Accounting! It is not a subject that should be left to students to figure out. I refuse to ask him questions because he waists more time NOT answering them. He needs some serious time management lessons!,0
"Alex loves math and cats seemingly exclusively, so when you need her to be available, she is. She's very flexible with arranging to meet with students and she explains the theory behind the math very well. She wants her students to succeed.",1
"I understand that online classes are probably hard to teach, but she was totally AWOL the whole time. I emailed her four times during the class, and she never once got back to me. She would fix and change things but never communicate at all. The class is graded (often outdated) busywork, more time consuming than chemistry or calculus.",0
Prof Wheeler is brilliant! She loves what she teaches and you can really tell. There is a lot of readings but you can still do well if you skim and pay attention to her lectures. She is also very accessible outside of class and I've had so many wonderful conversations with her. She really levels with her students and wants them to succeed,1
Puts her work ahead of your work. I thought teachers were here for students.,0
"Mr. Mac is a really excellent professor. I had no accounting experience and little interest in it, but he made this class exciting and interesting. It's a lot of work and you have to put effort in, but he's a really funny guy. Sit at the front so he gets to know you. Also take advantage of office hours. He really wants people to do well!",1
"One of the best i've taken at Loyola. Decent amount of work, but it's never unnecessary. I would DEFINITELY take him again.",1
"Nice teacher, took online. Very helpful. You will have weekly discussion posts, 3 Reader Responses (400 words) and 3 essays (800-2200) words. Lots of writing. She has a mandatory number of words for everything, even discussion posts.",1
Useless prof. He doesn't explain why we're doing anything in class. He just writes a bunch of formulas with no motivation behind them. He laughs when you don't understand something.,0
Dr. connolly is a super sweet professor! if you just take notes and study for her 3 tests youll be fine! all you have are the 3 tests (which one can get dropped) and a final. Youll get an A no problem if you just take notes! TAKE HER!,1
Take his course if you want to do well all year and then have your grade plummet cuse of his nonsensical final exam questions.,0
we're all so used to being teached in the traditional textbook way and this teacher is the exact opposite. It was nice to have a prof that lets you figure things out through a journal and does not just throw things at you to memorise and vomit back up on an exam. I loved this class. Its a lot of work to keep up with the journal but worth it!,1
"Taking a physics class, I expected the curricula to be difficult. Mr. Bannow has a great sense of humor and likes to talk about his life experiences to explain topics. As long as your prepared to do the homework and like using google, you should have no problem getting at least a B in his class with all the extra credit he gives.",1
"Dr. Cole knows what he's talking about. He really knows his stuff, and if you're a geography major, take his class. For the rest of you, avoid him. Lecture heavy and at the end of the year you receive (no joke) a 25 page instruction book for a single page paper. Good luck",0
"She is very disrespectful, and you're better off not participating. Maybe even try researching the answers to your question before asking because she is rude when you raise your hand in general. She acts like students are complete idiots. We spent an entire class time learning how to write a paper, and what plagiarism is. Would not suggest.",0
The best teacher at Concordia. Nice and helpful. Takes time to answer tought questions and makes sure that we undestand the matter. Highly recommended!,1
Horriable...makes you feel so bad during every class,0
So hawt. Great instructor.,1
"Terrible terrible terrible. Curved down the entire class a ridiculous amount. To get a B you needed a 88%. Can barely understand her because of the accent, does not communicate with students, and even changed her mind about the syllabus on the last day grades were due in a way which hurt her students. Do not take any of her classes",0
"I took this professor for english comp 1 and 2 a couple of years ago. I hated her so much that I occasionally come back here to warn people how unprofessional and bipolar she is. I would get B's on her papers with NO explanation as to why??!? If you're a cute boy you'll probably do well in her class, the rest of us have to work a little harder.",0
"Quite clear, very helpful, nice guy",1
"If you want a professor that makes you feel stupid, well here he is! This guy acts like we already know the stuff he is teaching us. This guy is the classic evil professor. His reviews on papers make you want to crawl up in a ball and die. They are very rude and are likely to put down a persons confidence.",0
"Im really surprised at how low her rates are. Out of all the professors I've had she was one of the most inspiring. Unconventional, yes, but I learned a lot from her. I think being challenged to learn in different ways and to trust the process is important, and nobody does this better than her. If you let her, she'll change the way see the world.",1
"Can explain the most difficult theories, critique them, and suggest alternatives. Expects you to think innovatively.",1
"Lectures didn't make any sense, whenever I asked for help he would be condescending, and when I had a group they excluded me and I emailed him about it and he did not care. He is the worst professor and I wish I held off on taking this class instead of experiencing this.",0
This man was the best teacher I have ever had always had a smile on his face and brought snacks highly recommend.,1
"Awesome teacher, very funny also. Sometimes class can get boring but he is very specific and you learn a lot in class. There are a few essays you have to do but he is lenient when grading and gives good feedback. I definitely recommend this class. He is also helpful if you have any questions outside of class.",1
One of the best profs in UW!!!!!!!!!!!,1
"Great prof, the course was structured well and the MCQ exams were fair if you studied for them. His lectures summarized the content well and were a useful starting point for the chapter.",1
"Dr. Ramey is an incredible professor! Every time I left classI left in a great mood. I really enjoyed his class, and his teaching style; he makes you think. If you attend his lectures and read the assigned readings you will do well on the quizzes. If you need help, he and Ms. Funkhouser (TA) will make time for you.",1
"Great professor. He explains difficult theories well and makes sure that everyone understands. He's happy to have impromptu discussions. I hated it at first , but it grew on me. He is a bit opinionated, but he really tries not to share them. There's a lot of writing assignments and reading, but do the work, ask questions, and you'll be fine. ",1
"WORST class I have ever taken. The discussion class is misnamed, the tests are impossible to study completely for and the paper outlines are apparently written with the expressed purpose of tricking students. Needs to learn to control the volume of her voice- BADLY.",0
"Awesome prof! Lots of funny stories, and really helpful. Participate in class and prepare for the exams (she gives you the questions before hand) and you will do well.",1
She deffenetely knows her stuff. I really don't like the way she speaks. She has a big accent and it annoyed me so much. He is one hardworking professor but she demands a lot. I consider myself as a very good student but for some reason no matter how much I tried I could not do that good in her class. I ended up gettin a B in her class.,1
"This semester has been rough, it is all online and he has not been good at teaching or helping students. There are lectures he puts up, but if you do not understand it, he will not help you. Also, the final is FORTY PERCENT of your grade. Definitely would not take him again.",0
He's the MAN! Best course I had at E-town. He was great at relating it to real life situations and I actually looked forward to class. Tests are hard though--because this dude wrote the book! (for real).,1
Awesome teacher!I didn't know anything about Business law going into this class. I have learned sooo much from him. Attending class is highly recommended!Print slides off before class and take notes as he lectures-helped me alot.dont buy the text book! you can print it off on the website you do the 1quizzes on for a cheaper price!test-werent to bad,1
"I'm very confused about the positive feedback I've heard from other people on this prof because this was truly the most boring class I've ever taken, which was why I struggled to get a good grade- it was so hard to pay attention in class when I could motivate myself to even go. He reads his notes for the entire lecture.",0
Awful teacher. I came in with no coding experience and was immediately lost. Inaccessible and frankly rude outside of class when asking questions. Quizzes and exams are worded confusingly and he often makes mistakes.,0
"Professor Draper is a brilliant instructor; lectures are straightforward and enlightening. Shes also a very warm person; she is willing to work individually with students to help them achieve their goals. Clear communication of expectations and transparent grading. Environmental law, policy, and society course was awesome! Definitely recommended.",1
She will offer you no extra credit and will not round your grade. If you need 208 points for a B and only have 207 best believe youre getting a B. She will fail you even if youre about to graduate and are 1 point shy. Basically you are on your own to read all the material and hope you pass. Lockdown browser with webcam required.,0
"Avoid this woman.  She seems really sweet the first week but talks down to students and acts as though we are 3 years old.  She confuses herself while teaching and says the wrong thing then denies that she made an error.  She requires tutoring yet is unwilling to work with you if this does not fit your schedule.  Trick questions, no partial credit.",0
"Professor Baez is tight. Meetings were only once a week, assigned with one homework, which is pretty easy if you pay attention in class. There is also tutoring which you may need to attend twice. Overall great instructor.",1
Great professor! gives lots of examples and is very helpful. Nothing but good things to say,1
"He is a horrible professor. He goes off of the subject and wastes class time telling stories that the class has no interest in. He cuts students off while they are in the middle of speaking. He makes references to people and things and usually is offensive when making jokes, especially about race. Would not recommend his class at all.",0
Dont take him-- He makes you feel really small when you try to make a comment or state your opinion.,0
"Halstead is a really cool professor, with the real potential to change the way you think.",1
She gives you a quiz over the chapter before you even go over it in class. This class is very hard and she tells you from the very beginning that if you don't study 20hrs. a week you wont pass. She is a fast reader and if  you don't get the notes down she doesn't really care. If this is your first Science class to take DO NOT TAKE HER! ,0
"Can you say picky picky picky,too much instruction it can drive someone crazy, tedious information that is not needed unless your a journalist. seriously!",0
"Dr. Stevens is a very smart man but he treats this class like we are already physicians. Tests are impossible, only 2-3 out of 100+ people pass the test prior to him curving it 40-50%. Do not take him w/o prior medical experience (This is the only reason I passed with an A). He makes the class unnecessarily tough by not explaining topics fully.",0
"I once dropped one of his classes due to a personal crisis. Instead of judging me, he took time to counsel me and give me advice. Not only a great teacher, a great man of God.",1
"One of the worst, most unreasonable profs I have had at Ryerson. Teaches in a very monotonic, slow manner. Made up ""negative"" marks for final exam so that no one does well on the course, and acts very aggressively towards student who ask questions. He has an awful personality and no teaching skills. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!",0
"VERY boring lectures, but test = class notes.",1
"Show up to class, ask questions, and if you need her to be in the math lab she will go and help you! Make sure you study. As long as you do the work and show up you'll be ok. She offers retests and gives take home quizzes. Not the worst teacher like many people say. You need the textbook for hw.",1
This will be the easiest yet most educational class you'll take as an undergrad. Mayor Street brings in many guest speakers which definitely contributed a lot to my learning and experience. He also gives minimal work/hw and is a great resource. Also he brings pizza the last class.,1
"I took his online class. 2 Minor Speeches and 3 Major persuasive speeches. Quizzes every Sunday, based only on textbook and after 2 lowest grade dropped. 3 Exams based on selected chapters. The textbook was expensive and the access code is required. His lectures were based on the quiz after it is taken, which was repetitive. Overall, easy grader!",1
"Rude and not willing to help students, has walked away twice in the middle of me asking him a question about chemistry. Barely finishes lectures before we have an exams and rushes everything, take another professor!",0
"Great gen ed to take. It was an easy class, but I learned a lot and it shaped my world view dramatically (and helped me choose my minor). It's a discussion-based class, and focused on concepts not vocab and facts and stuff, so it helps you develop important skills for the future. Also, the prof. is sooo sweet and structures the class really well.",1
Ashe is a very reasonable and down to earth professor. Their class is a good intro to photoshop and simple design principles.,1
"Doonan is a good professor, hes very clear of what is going to be on the exams. There are 3-4 pop quizzes, but if youre paying attention in class you should do fine on them. (5 questions) you watch 4 films in class & hes very knowledgeable. Pay attention & you should be fine.",1
"Boring! Very monotone, but tries to throw the odd joke in there. Test was very fair.",0
"The single best professor in the school in terms of ability to concisely relay a rather boring (for me) subject.  His self-deprecating humor is a bit annoying, but you will not find a professor who cares about his students more than he does--he walks the walk and talks the talk.  A great mentor, too!",1
He was a really good prof in terms of teaching and also his class was never boring,1
lecture is boring exam is heavy strict rules in class. If u r using phone or labtop in class he will walk over to embrasse you. Time was short for exam and if didnt finish the sheets he wont allow you finsh it. Dont ever take his class . trust me.,0
"I have taken her for three classes: INFO 2420, INFO 4120 and INFO 4430 (all times I was forced take her). 4120 class felt more about making pretty graphs and not much BI focused. Her instructions are oddly specific for each individual assignment but the written instructions and her videos often conflict and are outdated. Wouldn't recommend.",0
"He treats you like a child. Most things he says don't make sense. I feel he was very degrading and rude to students. I dreaded going to class. If you do your homework he picks on you and makes you feel dumb. It's his way or the highway. You better always be in class, have a textbook, be prepared to listen to him talk nonstop. Wouldn't recomend.",0
He is the worst professor I have had at GV. He made me feel dumb when I asked questions and did not help me at all. I ended up having to teach myself. He does not teach and gives worksheets on material we don't know and then grades it on accuracy.,0
"Mr Parineh is an excellent instructor and he knows his materials very well. He provides many real world experiences and quick tips like how to start an LLC, sole prop, etc. He encourages students to invest early and what is safe to invest in. I have learned many valuable info that are useful in starting a career.",1
"Her clases demand hard work and attentin but she really helps you expand your mind and get your brain working, especially her questions. but VERY tough grader, never gives good feedback on papers or in discussion and can make you feel really dumb and discouraged but I learned SO much in her classes.If you REALLY want to be challenged, take her!",0
"An incredibly sweet man.  He's a high school teacher so he's always on top of things and letting you know when things are coming up.  He does everything he can to help you learn the language.  Course starts off RIDICUOUSLY EASY, but gradually get's fairly difficult.  vocab quizzes are an easy grade, and the exams arent too bad.",1
"Attending class was a waste of time, we never did anything but high school stuff",0
"People are so rude... yes, she cancels lectures but thats because of her medical conditions. She tries to account for this as best she could (e.g. she made the F2017 term final based on just the textbook readings.) That being said, her lectures were barebones anyways, so getting the textbook is mandatory to succeed in this course.",0
"Took two classes (335 and 352) with him and I respect him quite a bit. He got a PhD in JUnit testing, what a mad lad. He's very knowledgeable about programming and is capable of engaging in good discussions about the material. Sometimes, it seems like he's condescending, yeah, but I feel like that's because he thinks this is easier material",1
"Dr. Lysonski is one of the best professors I've had at MU.  If you're looking for a guy who can relate the text material to real professional experience, this is your professor.",1
Insane class. This professor did nothing for us. When we asked questions we were shut down with rude responses that were smart ass like. It was just not a good course at all. We worked so hard to receive such petty grades. She obviously had favorites. I mean give me a break. We literally are having class over a screen. -GIB,0
"Jan Grabowski is one of the best profs I have had so far. Not only is he obviously very passionate about what he teaches, the fact that he was born in Poland and can speak German and Polish is very important for the class on the Holocaust, where many of the documents need to be translated from those two languages. I learnt so much!!",1
Not a good professor. Never checks his email so if you have a question don't expect to get it answered unless you ask during class. He doesn't use D2L and never posts grades. He uses webcourse which looks like it hasn't been updated since 1992. Often rude to students during class and will argue just about anything. Don't recommend.,0
"THE WORST TEACHER I HAVE EVER HAD.Dr.O should not be teaching.I can't believe I paid $ to be in a class taught by this disorganized, insulting, degrading, pompus women.  She humiliated students who asked Q's. Her tests are beyond disorganized and she obviously doesn't wrtite them herself. SHE BLOWS!",0
"Dr. Gwynn taught stats slowly and explained concepts well. However, the course was not organized effectively (labs, textbook and lectures were not well coordinated). Aplia and assignments were easy grade boosters and exams were fair as long as you did the practice. His sense of humour was cute. This course was not as bad as I expected it to be.",1
"Taught the class like you already knew the material. Definitely not a good class to take if you dont know anything to begin with. Doesnt really teach it like an intro course. The test were decent, but the homeworks were hard and the TAs didnt grade hard on them.",0
Professor Van Horn's class is great! She is very thoughtful and helpful. Would highly recommend this professor!!!,1
"I could not stand this prof. The class was not very helpful. Most of the assignments were like word or ppt assignments i had done in middle school. He didn't give me feedback for over half of my projects, so I never knew what my grade was. Also discussion board questions were so repetative, or could be answered by simple common sense.",0
I wish he would teach other PAD classes. Excellent professor.,1
"what can i say !... he killed my intrest in engineering :( if there was a kingdom for the bad profs he will be the king, dont take anything with thtis idiot i dont care if you have to skip the whole year,,, it will still be better",0
Neil is the best and I enjoy his class. You have to show up but the assignments are easy and the exams are more than fair. No stupid group projects either-hallelujah!,1
"Prof. Thomas was a great teacher. I learned so much from her and my writing has improved immensely. Since this is a writing class, expect to do A LOT of that. It is not easy, but it is totally do-able. When she tells you about something in your writing you might want to fix/change, do it. The feedback she gives is consistent to her grading.",1
"Jones was an awesome professor, but his test and homework were pretty tough.  3 exams, 3 quizes, 1 research paper+EC. He teaches the most important parts of psychology , book is not recommended. He has an online outline of what he is going to teach and was very helpful, print it if you can or use your laptop . I highly recommend taking his class!!",1
Dr. Dickens is one of the best professors I've ever taken. I would take him for every class if I could. His class is taught the way college should be taught. He doesn't care if you come to class but take good notes so that when he gives you the study guide; you won't have to re-read anything over. He gives 1 midterm & final and you need a blue book,1
Essays are hard. Lectures are skeleton-like and expect too much participation from students. Lecture slides are useless. Massive curving though.,0
Spends more time making sarcastic political comments than on course material.  Was late to every class meeting. Not helpful. Not accessible out of class. Although he is an adorable old man and his jokes are sometimes funny. By far not worth failing a class.,0
"Lovett is an awesome guy, took his Industrial Revolution class and loved it. He brought in awesome models for technology from the Middle Ages to demo topics and all the tests were based entirely on the lecture material so you don't have to read. 2 papers, one 3,000 word and one 5,000, but you can use most of the 3,000 word one in the 5,000 word one",1
"She is very reasonable, she grades her papers easy I received an A on every single paper I wrote in her class. We did done online homework not sure she checks it we also use the books for notes and hw which are pretty simple but her test are very challenging I always received 60 or 70's on the test but I passed the class with a B. I recommend her",1
"Great professor, very caring and eager to help. Content is clear, direct, and simple. Would for sure take another class with her again. Very reasonable and manageable class. She has a lot of opportunities for people to do well; grades are based on a lot of different things. You are only required to go to half of the classes the entire semester.",1
Shamane is an absolutely worthless professor.  Its interesting how an extremely picky writing teacher who is a lawyer still uses the word ain't.  And she calls us unprofessional.  What a joke.  Shamane is full of herself and not too much knowledge of how to teach or anything else good for that matter.,0
Daniel Chester is experienced and kind. It's a joy to have him at the University of Delaware.,1
"Keep in mind that Mr. Mahaffey went to Chicago, a top 5 MBA program.  He wants Siena students to be Chicago-quality and perform.  If you don't want to, then yes, take a different class.  His class was hard, but worth it.  I went from Siena to another top 5 B-school school partly because of this class.  This is also why Siena is now accredited.",1
"I went into this thinking that ""oh this guy can't be that bad"" and now I wish I never ignored the ratings on this page. I shouldn't even be going to SDSU in my opinion. The school in general just sucks. But back to the topic, yeah this teacher sucks. He goes through problems and says ""You need this skill"" yet doesn't exactly explain how to get it.",0
"It is crazy.  I am in a non-bio major and she is SUPER detail oriented, Hard tests, and she is dept head so she is never available to talk.  I wish someone else taught this class at UNCC.",1
"The GOAT fr. Considerable amount of writing throughout the semester, however, the project is all about yourself (and who doesn't love writing about themselves?!). Extremely caring and a super fun, enjoyed the upbeat and energetic nature of his lectures. I feel like if I was to run into any of my profs at burning man festival it would be him #avibe",1
just don't take it,0
"He was visiting Canterbury Uni for a semester. He taught us nothing, relied on the textbook and Youtube tutorials, and simply provided TopHat quizzes in class to check if we had read the book. The questions were specific to the book, rather than the topic area. He calls this 'peer instruction' but doesn't augment it with actual lectures.",0
"As many have said, Dr. Vega is a great guy, but he is the most unorganized professor I have taken, junior college included. His lecture notes are a mess, direction and instruction are unclear, and his quizzes/tests are no better. Be prepared for up to a grade drop, and know it isn't your fault. Show up, ask q's, do your best .",0
Extremely harsh grader that makes you feel like the worst writer in the world. Pray for a B.,0
Prof Meyerson was probably the nicest prof I've ever had at U of T. His knowledge and intelligence are evident from his lectures. He really made an effort to get to know his students. Definitely take a class with him!,1
"Latimer was an amazing professor. His lectures were always fun and interesting. Taking notes is a must, as well as reading the textbook. He really only grades tests and quizzes, so if you study for them you'll do fine.",1
Professor is a 60 year old kid. Lots of discussion in class. Leans toward Marxism.,1
I DON'T LIKE HIM,0
"Took for Quantum! Amazingly brilliant!  Very Personable and Patient, giving of his time, worked very closely with students.  A god of physics!  If you have him for lecture try to have in recitation as well kinda shaky in front of large class",1
"This professor has an amazing resume, but dont let that trick you. He is rude to students, doesnt answer questions most of the time, even thought he will ask if anyone has questions. He may struggle with hearing as he does wear a hearing aid, but that does not excuse his attitude. He picks and chooses who he calls out, and you will learn very lit",0
"Unfortunate class. You will have to know the book inside out, and will also need to be lucky. If only he actually cared about his students-what a shame. Midterm is not as bad as the final, which will be tremendously difficult. Good luck ",0
"Does anyone know who Seven Macaw was? No? Does anyone know the astronomical background of Seven Macaw?   Be ready for long, boring lectures with unending rhetorical questions. ",0
"While everything is stated in the syllabus, assignment due dates vary. Her warning is to ""check in and pay attention,"" but it will cost you points. Almost like there's no room for error when you're taking this intro to psych class, especially if you also have work, life, and other classes on your plate. Her tactics are military.",1
"Absolutely awful. Material was boring, he was completely disorganized in his lectures and wasn't helpful when asked for help. His TA was the only redeeming quality for the class. Attendance is mandatory, and he will fail you if you miss more than the allotted amount.. literally.",0
Majd is an outstanding Prof. He keeps things light and is very fun to learn from. Majd understands the material that he presents and effectively relays it to his students. I have thoroughly enjoyed working with Majd this semester ... and he's completely adorable.,1
She is very rude and reads directly from power points. She will force people to make friend with the others . The class is very boring and is very hard to remain focus,0
"There's going to be a lot of reading material as well as discussions, writing assignments, and 1 Book Analysis.  The material is fun and interesting! If you willing to work for it she will even dropen a few low grades.   Example: only have to do 7 out of 9 Discussions, or do 4 out of 5 Writing Assignments.  Take her she's awesome!",1
"Paula makes the class interesting and I enjoy going to class - that's hard for a prof to do, especially when the class is 4 days a week. She gives really good feedback and gently corrects mistakes when speaking - it is a comfortable environment to speak spanish in because she does not judge or make you feel judged. She wants her students to do well",1
Lots of assignments that seem like busy work more than anything. Took her months to give feedback. Her feedback was useless anyway. Never wanted to help students. She made herself very unapproachable to avoid doing more work then said had to. I would just avoid this teacher at all costs,0
Really enjoyable professor. He loves to relate real life situations to the material he teaches and does a great job at it.,1
"His lectures are AMAZING! I had him only for half a semester for General Studies, but the class was so interesting and really grasps your attention. He is crazy smart and is understanding if you can't make it to class. Whatever you do, DO NOT walk into class with your phone in site; PUT IT AWAY. Anyways, Dr. Bartl is great and attractive as well ;)",1
Grades based on 'policies' rather than on a mastery of coursework.,0
"This class should have been an easy A. Dr. Rani has a strong accent and does not provide her ppts outside of lecture, which is what makes the class difficult. This class should be an online class because I did not learn anything from lecture. I do NOT recommend taking this class with her. Her HW assign. and quizzes were not routinely scheduled.",0
"This was an easy class if you have a science background. Mike is a great prof that really cares about his students. There was a ton of free marks in the class (10%) and the midterms and final were easy if you studied. Too bad he won't be lecturing anymore, he got promoted... :(",1
"Awful. I've taken 2 writing courses prior to this one that were great. Professor Holt demands mandatory attendance in a virtual world (SL) in which we spent the first 2 meetings ( 4 +hours) going over all the ""fun"" things you can do in the virtual world. The majority of our writing so far has been one word answers so he can be sure we're not asleep",0
"Prof Infante is such a nice and genuinely caring person. Despite the fact that I never understood a single reading and could probably, at the end of the semester, not tell you what this class is about I would take the course again in a heartbeat. It is rare you find a professor as nice and class discussion was always fun even when it was confusing!",1
Professor Waller is one of the best instructors I've had in my entire college history. She is approachable & respectful. She answers questions & provides great explanation. She had us do a lot of simulation & practice tests which were so helpful! her tests are fair & she spends time analyzing them & throwing away certain questions. she's amazing!,1
"Professor Keyes is an awful Professor. She is mean and cruel to her students if they get anything wrong, which makes students never want to speak in class. She doesn't even help them try to understand it better. She expects them to know everything. I've always loved Italian and she makes me dread going to class and hate the subject. Worst professor",0
Not a bad teacher and was pretty easy. If you show any effort in the class you will at least get a C.,1
He makes the class easy and fun. Really chill and get on everyone's level. When having an open discussion he likes to push your buttons to test you to explain your point better. Very motivational towards students and is a good role model.,1
"Very fun teacher! Show up and try hard at each project and your sure to get a good grade. Study hard for quizzes, they were a bit challenging even for someone with photography experience.",1
He was boring and repetitive. His approach to IR is extremely dated.,0
Very hard to understand. Class is painful and long. Is funny and has a good sense of humor. If you take this class sit in the front row so you can hear and understand him!!!!!!!!!!!,0
"Super Smart!!! Knows what he is doing. Very nice and willing to help. If you don't study his help might not be helpful because you didn't do your part.Do all the worksheets and ask questions and you should do fine. Don't write notes on what is on his slides, take notes on what he says. Read the book for exams and study worksheets.",1
Hes a great guy and easy to get ahold of out of class. In class examples easy but once it comes to the test its completely different and harder. 2 quizzes a week around 4 questions each. Doesnt show you ur grade so you have no idea if you should drop the class or not. I would recommend another professor even though he is nice and funny.,0
Dr. Palmer is my favorite prof! He is the reason I stay and continue my degree in English at Alma. Super fun and gives great writing skills and advice!,1
Edo surprised me with his knowledge and teaching ability.,1
"monotone voice, id rather die than attend that class ever again",0
"Professor Killough was okay. She gives the most amount of work at the worst possible times, like during the every first week and during finals week she piles on the assignments, quizzes and homework. Her black board is very unorganized and made the class go on a wide goose chase to find the material they needed to do the assignments.",0
"She is a nice and friendly prof, midterm is easy and mark is fair. She would give a tons of example and make lectures interesting. Very suggest her if you need to take this course.",1
"People below that gave him awful grades obviously just didn't put in the work. I knew nothing about programming coming into it and got a B. He will definitely challenge you and make you go to the book before answering your question, but I didn't think he was too bad.",1
"Everyone says Judkins is a tough professor, but if you go to class, read all of the books and watch the movies it's an easy A. You MUST write down a lot of what he says because it will be on the test.",1
Professor Randall is a pretty awesome Professor and is always willing to help you inside and outside of the classroom. She always relates very well but can class can get slightly off topic easily.,1
Mike's feedback and grading criteria are unclear and subjective. Everything we read was gratuitously sexual and/or violent. The content of the class was honestly disturbing. Mike is not tolerant of the opinions of his students and is downright condescending and rude. My high school English classes were infinitely better.,0
DO NOT TAKE HIM EVEN IF YOU NEED THE CLASS!!!,0
"This course was one of the hardest courses I took. I thought it would've been easy, but it's not. I barely passed this course, only because I was emailing him 24/7, worrying and freaking out I wasn't going to pass. It's A LOT of quizzes and your final is an essay that has a lot of requirements",0
This teacher is a little strange but very nice. Explains things very well. I am not good with math and managed to pull an A in this class. If you need a math requirement take it with him,1
Meilleure prof de crimino ever!,1
"One of the best classes for those interested in East and Southeast Asia. Professor Katada is a fantastic lecturer, and she is also a very sweet woman. Not an easy A per say (the cutoff is a 95), but also not too difficult. She presents the material very straightforward. Reading is necessary, but interesting. She is awesome!",1
"Dr. Burd is an amazing professor. She does what ever she can to ensure that her students pass. She is the only professor that teaches Nutrition so if you are a nursing major you must take her. It may be helpful to go to tutoring a couple times for this class, but as long as you understand the equations, and read the notes you will do fine. ",1
She thinks she has to be so tough and comes off as rude and couldn't care less about students. Very turned off from my major b/c of her. She refuses to round even if you are above the .5 of a percent when rounding should happen. She doesn't care if you go to every class it doesn't get considered.,0
Coteaches with a teaching assistant who is more worthless than her. Who knew that was possible?,0
"She is a very thorough teacher who is bright and demanding of her students, I think she does this to test your commitment to the class and grades you on class participation. As long as you regularly attend, ask questions/comments and do the work you will receive a passing grade... and she kinda got hot toward the end of the semester ;)",1
Very Interesting class and great teacher. Syllabus seems far too demanding but when I started the assignments they were a lot easier than I thought.,1
"These kind of person, we should not even call them teachers, yet I don't know why they are hired as a teacher.",0
"Class is very boring, she rambles on and on about the same basic concepts. A good intro class though if you know NOTHING about research. A very nice prof. though.",1
I took this class as a gen-ed and this was by far THE HARDEST CLASS I HAVE EVER HAD! She spends the majority of the class talking about things that are not relevant. Maybe have about 20 productive minutes of class a day! The only part of this class I enjoyed was the groups we created ourselves because your group will be the only help you'll get.,0
"I would definitely recommend Dr. Huey & would take him again! He is so kind & friendly & knows so much about what he's teaching. He gives a good amount of homework, but it's not hard. He also gives plenty of opportunities for extra credit. Tests/exams are open book & open note, but are more on the difficult side.",1
Good luck. Copies notes incorrectly to board that have already been copied incorrectly...,0
If you take 401 with him you will hate your life.,0
Summer session with this dude is awful. only goes over few problems in his powerpoints which are nothing like quizzes and tests. Quizzes and homework get extemely hard especially when you take his 3 o 4 step example problems in class and applying them to 13-14 step problems on the quizzes and homework. May be a prof but cant explain adequately,0
She is the worst professor I ever had. She is very rude.,0
"One of the worst professors I have ever  had. He didn't explain the work in a manner that all students could understand, & would not help students that were not clear. His class was  with out a doubt the longest hour& 40 minuets ever. Stay away...",0
"He is very knowledgeable about the subject, but very hard to understand. The way he does his quizzes is horrible, and if he doesn't like your answer he will give you a zero. I suggest taking this class online to avoid the boredom that is the class.",0
"great playwright, horrible prof. sucks up to students (throws them parties) so they won't notice his slack/careless teaching style. sorry, but it's true.",0
"Mr. Holt is a very knowledgeable instructor. He definitely know his stuff and will help you if you ask for it. However, his lectures are virtually useless. He is easily distracted by questions and goes off on long tangents. It's really hard not to like the guy as a person, but i would avoid him as an instructor. READ THE TEXT.",0
Her enormous ego keeps her from teaching. Her class averages are the lowest on department wide tests. Disrespectful to students. Make friends with other classes; you will need their notes to pass. Almost her entire class is failing. Get adifferent prof. She is the failure!,0
"Great teacher, I went to the actual lecture one time and passed with an A. As long as you attend the lab you are sure to pass. I used the app Socratic to pass each test. All the tests are online and he lets you take a week to do them.",1
WOW! worst and meanest teacher ever!!! I tried super hard in his class and still failed. Did the whole 8 page paper and he wrote a MEAN comment on it. What a complete Jerk.,0
"Its a free credit course. All you need to write a story without paying attention what assignment is about. Basically, He does not read assignments. It is a great free 3 credit course.",0
IAH 201:American Indians and the World was great! He allows you to retake ANYTHING as long as you go to class each week. He is a bit disorganzied but going to class clears that up. The quizzes are SUPER easy as well as the midterm. Take his class you learn a lot you'd never know otherwise!,1
"She talks the entire time, but some how we have participation in our grade and you will never receive the full amount. The group project is so much work and a waste of time. Material is very dry and almost painful to learn about in the way she teaches. She does care about students and wants you to do well, but this is not a fun class by any means.",0
"This is the worst class I have ever taken. The only available Comm 230 section was a 180 student lecture with Cindy White. Worst professor. Attendance is pointless because she goes so off topic and the Powerpoints do not help! Your grade is based off only 3 tests, not leaving you any room for mistakes. All she does it babble.",0
"Best teacher, so nice and caring of her students. Tests are not hard if you study from her guided notes.",1
love this teacher!!!!!,1
"One of the worst professors I have ever had. She would grade me 0 on papers and be rude about it in the comments, instead of helping. I would meet with her and she would say that everything I got wrong shouldve been self explanatory. None of her class flows together, and I wasted so much time on this class for no reason. DO NOT TAKE HER PLEASE!!!",0
"Dr. Spencer is one of the best profs ever!!!  patient, very clear, very easy to understand... he is also more than a fair grader, because it's not too hard to do well in his class.",1
Professor is really sweet and caring. Homework isn't mandatory or graded but I suggest trying a few problems. She is really good at teaching effectively and looked forward to going to her class (I hate math). Gives LOTS of extra credit and chances to redeem your grade if necessary. Never had a problem with her accent.,1
This professor frustrates me. Even with extra credit work it wont make up for all of the daily assignments that have been put in... the daily quizzes can be hard and confusing. Do not recommend this teacher.,0
Took this class last semester. Overall I thought she was really caring and super nice.,1
Grading Criteria is not clear and the he believes himself to be very very important despite the fact that this class in barely relevant enough to be an integrated capstone. Don't disagree with him or lead on that you think he is ridiculous (i.e. dont show up to class) or he will get really petty. ,0
"Hard to understand what he says. He has a thick foreign accent and skips over content that should be taught with more attention. He tries to lighten the mood up with humor, some of which is funny, some of which is not so funny.",1
"The high scores from other reviewers are because this class is ridiculously easy, but what for Tim lacks in challenge he makes up for with insane long rambles. This Epics take at least 20min and they are as pointless as this class. You can go months without learning in class .This class rivals Nyquil for its power to put people to sleep",0
He is the hardest marker! DO NOT take his course you WILL regret it ,0
Pretty simple class until you get to the media plan. She explains it way too quickly and is very unclear about how to do it. I also had her for intro to web pub and I don't even think she knows html....,0
HEY DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH???,1
worst ever...,0
"Really nice and understanding teacher, his lectures are easy to understand and he usually relate the lessons to funny stories",1
"Professor Woodman is a wonderful professor, this was my second class with her and I'm so glad I decided to take it with her. She's super nice and always available for help with anything. This class also has a clear schedule for the whole semester and it's a very easy elective, so perfect for any upperclassmen and you learn some useful skills!",1
She is a big lecturer. She stands in front of the room and speaks. You pretty much have to write everything down that she says as well as read the textbook which is A LOT. The exam questions are very specific and she does not give any sort of study guide or anything to tell you what you should expect. Not impossible to get a good grade but hard to.,0
"Terrible prof! I felt like I learned virtually nothing about sociology. He would go on long off topic tangents that had nothing to do with the material. He only liked to talk about what he was interested in. However, class was blowoff and an easy pass as long as you studied in detail topics discussed in class.",0
I did not know a professor could be this vague. Her assignments are super vague and no one ever knows what they are supposed to be doing. She rly knows her stuff but is so vague and hard that you nvr know what to do or ur grade. And her office hours are horrible. You will NOT get help outside the class or ever know your grade while taking it.,0
"If you want to learn child and adolescent psychology, do not take this class. It is a very easy A but you do not learn a thing.",0
"Dr. Hayden-Roy is one of the best professors of History you will ever find. He always makes class interesting and finds a way to connect you to the history you are learning, he's hilarious too. You will have to write a lot in his class, but it will definitely help you in the long run.",1
"Hashmat is a good prof. The course isn't terribly difficult, and you won't regret taking his course. The previous reference to his courses running 2.5h is entirely false; that never happened. The TA ran pretty useless tutorials, but Khan was great.",1
Reads off textbook entire class & takes too long to explain things and everyone in class is falling asleep. Everyone just does training on SAM since he opens it when class starts and he's wondering why nobody is paying attention to him.  Make sure you sit beside people who know what they're doing or you're either gonna fail or do really bad,0
"Literally the BEST class and professor I have EVER taken. This class is a lit requirements for arts students which is why I took it and omg, not only is O'Brien the most caring prof I've ever had, your grade is based off of reading commentary, one creative project of your choice, and peer feedback. She wants everyone to do amazing. TAKE THIS CLASS!",1
He is a very tough grader for an online class. He does not post lectures but does post powerpoints with random graphs and no context. Homework is fairly simple and straightforward but the entire learning experience is on your own. He is simply there to provide material. 12-page paper and final due within 2 weeks no excuses(even in the pandemic),0
"Prof Haskell is a nice math teacher and loves it, but not a good teacher. Explanations are often ambiguous and makes mistakes when explaining. Doesn't know how to explain something differently than her way. Take her class if you have previous experience and understand stats. Bad teacher for a first time stats taker. Need to teach yourself. 2exams",0
"Its been a few years and I had to go back and rate her. Although I passed with flying colors, I wish I could back and take this class with someone else. For a INTRO class this class is way too demanding of 1st year college students. Over does the talking portion. She is very nice, just not particularly meant to teach fresh college students psych.",0
I learned a lot in this class.,1
"Good lectures, good readings, easy first exam, ridiculous final with very specific identifications that had been mentioned offhandedly in class (not featured on powerpoints). Learned a lot but final grade did not feel dependent on work put in/ time spent studying for final/ knowledge of class material. If you're concerned about GPA be careful",0
Putney is the best history professor at bentley,1
"I had a 7:30 class with him. He is a soft-spoken teacher and it is very hard to listen to him. He only does 3 major tests in his class. Studying this topic was very hard for me and he did not help in any way. His tests did not cover the material he taught us. Also, his tests were online and I wouldn't recommend this teacher at all.",0
"He is one of the best professors I've had here at UNCC. Always there to help with questions on homework and tests and deeply understands the material and the topic of operations. This class was enjoyable for a non-operations major.  Tests are tough (math wise)  only 3 & non-cum. final, one group paper, homework NEEDED to pass tests, not collected.",1
Jane is wonderful ! Would recommend her to anyone 100% super fashionable as well,1
I am glad that I took this prof online instead of in person. Lectures are brutal and loves to call on people to workout problems. Will not move on until you get it (I guess that's a good thing??). He's super smart but had to use outside resources to keep up with lessons and study for exams. Only good thing: he never assigned homework.,0
"Extremely knowledgable about the topic, but rants forever about obscure references that have nothing to do with the class and treats every student like a fellow PhD of European history. Also made a few r.a.p.e jokes that made everyone feel pretty awkward.",0
Bouncy... bouncy... bouncy... HYPER,1
"Great professor who really cares about his students. He's willing to help anyone who wants to put the work in. That being said there is a lot of work, but it's chemistry, so if you need to know the material it's all for your benefit. 4 exams, 1 final, and labs graded out of 10 points weekly. No graded homework. No power-points. Take good notes.",1
It's a shame this man is a professor for the prerequisite classes. He seems so unhappy teaching 2D and 3D which transfers into our class environment. If you are not conceptual or performative do not expect him to like your work. I see him discouraging many future artists which is very disappointing. Do not take him if you have the option.,0
"Great professor, interesting class...gives hard tests but generally fair and helpful",1
There is one midterm and a final. They are both 100 true/false questions. He tells you that you will not need to know things for the test that he then puts on there. Average for the tests is a 60%. Lectures are super interesting and I learned a lot but Dr. Snider likes to purposely trick you on the exams.,1
"Dr. Stewart is a fun, fair and generous professor. He's the sherlock holmes/ Jean-Luc Picard of the history department.",1
I absolutely do not recommend her! Online class is terrible! Gave tons of assignments at beginning of semester without any kind of discussion/lecture. Never replied to emails. Kept saying her computer was broken when the students went to her in person. It's midway through the semester and still no contact? Please! Try using other excuses!,0
"By far, my favorite class and professor at CMU. I'm a soc major but his GEO373 class was a great change. He's Hilarious and posts all his power points online. There is two extra credit opportunities and only two quizzes which are easy map ones. Let's you use notes on tests.",1
Terrible Teacher. This is a computer programming class yet we did zero programming. The class involves doing journal entries on the chapter and occasionally we have to do assignments. This doesnt seem bad but the problem is he expects you to know code for the exams which by the way are impossible. The highest grade on our midterm was a 73. ,0
"Mrs. Siu was a great Professor. Definitely would take again, even though I had to work hard for my grade. Lab and owl assignments ( online quizzes ) are incorporated into your grade and help at the end of the semester. Quizzes are a bit harder, but once you get to the tests it makes it easier! She drops two quizzes and two worksheets which helps.",1
This was probably one of my least favorite classes. I felt like his tests were extremely unfair and difficult.  He didn't really have too much homework and there were periodically reading quizzes.  The tests made up most of the grade which made it hard to do well.,1
"Tim Ball is a sweet old man but he grades our speeches harshly and though there is a rubric, his grading criteria is not clear and he does not give great feedback either. The class is boring and everything we learn is self-explanatory, yet the exams have misleading questions and are difficult. He isn't good at technology, so Zoom is frustrating.",0
"Some people don't mind Dubovskiy's teaching style, but I wasn't a fan of it. He came to almost every lecture unprepared and when he taught, he improvised and flew by the seat of his pants. Although he's helpful when you ask questions, he was rarely in his office, didn't respond to any emails, and was all around, a very irresponsible professor. ",0
Easy A. Be aware that there is a $90 course fee.,1
Tom actually cares about the course and your understanding of the material. If anyone else taught this class it would be super boring! Tom is passionate about giving students not only a increase in knowledge but a way to jump start your career. He knew my name by the second class! Speak up in class! Seriously no dumb questions with Tom.,1
"Perry is wonderful, and extremely accessible. He's very helpful if you attend office hours and his lectures are very clear. He gives a ton of examples-- study those for class.",1
TAKE HIM!,1
"I was a student of Professor Zorbas back in the early 90's.  Although I was too young to know it then, he was probably the most helpfull Professor in regards to preparing me for my career accomplishments.   I am eternally grateful.",1
"If you want a solid understanding of international trade, take this class. The way Dean Kaneda is able to break down complicated trade concepts, then apply them to real world scenarios in his lectures is amazing! His test questions can be tricky, and you'll have to work really hard to do well, but it's definitely worth the effort.",1
History of the American Indian.  Wonderful professor and lecturer.  Tests are incredibly fair and papers are on the topic of your choice.,1
"don't even bother, doesn't have a lesson plan. often mixes the material she taught in your class with the material she taught at wayne state. if you want to reach her you must use wayne state email address.",0
"Lots of reading to do. She doesn't check it, but you need to know it for essays and tests. Her lectures are boring, and aren't neccessary for doing well on tests/ essays, which makes getting through class hard. She takes attendance. But she nice, friendly, and generally if you read, and study, you'll do well. I have an A.",1
"Mr. Auten is a great teacher, I had his class up at the TUNE extension building last semester. He's a really nice guy who makes those night classes really comfortable and engaging. Easily one of my favorite teachers and classes,  I recommend him wholeheartedly.",1
"If you enjoy self-learning then this is the class for you. For the online version of his class, all he did was give you links for youtube videos and said figure it out. He also doesn't give enough time on the exams but when you ask him for extra credit he doesn't offer it. Go with caution when taking this class, many breakdowns happened.",0
Liked her a lot.  Made me think.,1
"Dr. Zambrano is a fantastic teacher! This is an advanced grammar course, so it is difficult, but he is always willing to help! Super nice, but make sure that you come to class and are willing to participate.",1
Very good teacher. Had C's through high school and she made me an A student. Absolutely love her!,1
"I was so into her class, it was so much fun. I love English, I'd always go to her office hours for help to peer edit my essay and get more feedback. She was very helpful. BUT! She is not clear with assignments, hard grader, and has no sympathy. She said I was passing then gives me a NP. She's misleading. Don't take her. Just being honest!",0
Amazing ! If only all math teachers were just like him ! Do your homework attend math lab take good notes and you are solid !,1
Had the pleasure of taking Prof. Carty's class nearly 20 years ago during my undergrad. Best professor I have ever had the opportunity to learn from.  Beware. He does not suffer fools lightly. ,1
"You'll come out of the class knowing what you've learned, which is more than can be said about some professors.",1
Her lecture material does not prepare you for any tests or exams. Questions are randomly picked from a test bank and are simply memorization questions of unnecessary topics. Overall in order to get a good grade in the class you must memorize everything in the entire textbook and prey.,0
He's really funny and easy to get along with,1
"Dr. Hesford really broadened my horizons on the topic of visual rhetoric.  This is really one of those classes that has carried over into my life-- I'm constantly finding myself analyzing billboards and commercials.  And she was so available and helpful when it came to projects and papers.  Overall, a wonderful experience.",1
"He is a very odd teacher and his lectures are very boring. The exams are pretty hard if you don't study and go over your notes. You get points off if you don't show up in class, so if you want some easy points, go to class.",0
This woman is not nice and actually quite rude. Lacks respect for every student and has no patience or empathy it seems. Told us that wifi not working wasn't an excuse even though we are completely online due to a national pandemic which in its own is absolutely absurd. The only reason I would recommend this class is because there are no exams.,0
Jeff is awesome and so easy! I had no prior CS experience and ended up with a B. All you have to do is show up to class and he basically gives you the answer to the assignment! Highly recommend. Super lenient grading and the textbook is free and provided for online.,1
Goodyear made the topic extremely interesting.  I would take a class with him again.,1
Jones is a great professor. Very interesting course and very organized. 10/10 reccomend. Far better than BUS220,1
"Obviously those who don't want to do the work will give the worst reviews. Those who say she has an accent are plain ridiculous. She is very organized, gives wonderful lectures and has emailed back in a few minutes. So not sure what the complaints are about! Tough class, so do your WORK!!!!! She made an online class WORK! Great prof.",1
"I'm had a 4.0 until I took this class. No one knows what he's ever talking about. His test are all short answer, paragraph, and essay questions. There's no homework which is nice but his tests are difficult. He gives you a study guide but you  don't really know what to expect. If you're looking for an easy LBST grade pick someone else",0
"I took his online POL121 class, and it's been boring but easy. The amount of reading is ridiculous, but you only have a discussion and long assignment every week. I find the class VERY boring, and it doesn't help that we do the same thing every week and read LOTS of articles. He seems nice and grades easily, but I wouldn't take this class again.",1
"Bonzo is the man! Of all the professors I have had, I've learned the most from him. I think differently because of this class. Don't limit yourself by settling for an easier prof, if you want an epiphany of an education you spent a good chunk of money for, take Bonzo.",1
"This professor does make the occasional mistake, but she knows her stuff and wants everyone to do well.  This is a VERY EASY A if you go to lecture and do homework, even though lecture is extremely boring at times.  I studied for less than 2 hours total for the final and aced it.",1
"He should not have been teaching this class, I dont care if they couldnt find anyone else. He doesnt understand what women go through, and acts kinda stuck up about it. Hes ridiculously nit picky about wording and sentence structure in papers?? Hes not an English teacher. He grades too harshly and can be very rude. 0/10 Wouldnt recommend.",0
"He is tough, but fair. You will learn a lot if you are interested. He doesn't use a book so it is a good way to save some money.",1
Horrible prof. His exams are impossible unless you have the past ones. Recycles. No interest in teaching; unfair marking.,0
"He is a good professor orgo is not easy. He does not require attendance but he knows who comes and who doesn't. He is willing to help you, and giving a lot of additional resources to help.",1
"15% curve on exams, lotsa extra credit, extra credit exam, 2 attempt optional exam that drops lowest grade, answers any and all questions with much depth post class and  well during class. Lectures are def way worse than  Sarathy but Sarathy def isnt better since both have same book and tell you to study the whole chapter but Sarathy doesn't curve.",1
Ms. M was a great teacher. Not very interested in subject but made it very bearable. PowerPoints have lots of info but all of it is needed to build concepts. Replaces lowest grade with attendance % if it helps you. Emails back very quickly and easy grader. Extra credit available. Very nice and approachable. Really - a great prof! Recommended.,1
He is all over the place,0
"This class is a lot of reading material. If you don't read the entire chapter before attending lecture you will be very confused. I also think she relies too much on her pass sessions to explain information, and goes quickly in the actual class. There is a lot of outside work in this class. Her tests are almost impossible.",0
Worst class I have ever taken,0
Dr. Balog is not a great professor - he likes to spend more time telling stories and reprimanding students than actually teaching the subject. His tone can be condescending and he doesn't create a very welcoming environment. I would not recommend him.,0
Dr. Capozzi was the worst teacher I'd ever had.  Mumbles to himself alot and tells you incorrect information. Quizes are easy but his tests are really hard. The class average on the tests were 65%. If you are so unfornate to have to take this professor do the review questions at the end of the chapter because he puts some of them on the test.,0
"This class was for non-science majors and wow it was hard. I saw the professor like two times the whole semester (it was taught by grad students) and the experiments were so particular, it was hard for you to do it right. Pop quizzes are three questions and can get you too so watch out. Show up to class or you get a zero for that lab that day.",0
"She was clear in her expectations for the class, but her midterm and final exams didn't match the content of the chapter tests. Pretty much be prepared to memorize the whole book!",0
A really amazing professor! Cares a lot about his students and only wants you to succeed. You have to write a lot of papers but he's such an easy grader. His final was on paper that we could take home to do. His tests are like the power points and the quizzes he gives the answers to you right before it. I'm taking him again next semester!,1
"I'm sure most people will agree that you will hate him with a passion and then learn to really like him. He may take his stuff too seriously, but at least he is passionate about it. Despite the boring content his lectures manage to be interesting. He knows what he's doing and is at the very least sincere. He's not very understanding. But he's okay.",1
"Wendy is probably my favorite professor of all time. Not only is she incredibly intelligent and helpful, she also took us out for drinks after we finished our research!",1
"Dr. Clif is a great professor and pretty funny. He gives great lectures. The only real issue with him is that you only have two grades for the whole semester, a midterm and a final. If you just take notes you should be fine.",1
"Colleen is an absolute angel!! I wish she taught all of my classes, she really is the best. She's very hilarious, caring, and she'll like you if you participate. She makes the lecture very interesting and engages the class to come up with ideas on each topic. I would come to class as she doesn't upload grades/slides and she's heavy on the quizzes.",1
Worst teacher in the world Do not take the class Doesn't know how to teach confusing Not helpful  Bad gradin,0
"off topic. He will play 7 videos a class and none of them will be relevant to the course material. this class has so many assignments where you will be left thinking ""when did I learn this"" and it's probably because you never did. most disorganized course I've been in.",0
"The nicest lady ever. A little bit of a language barrier because English is her third language and French is her second. She is funny and genuinely wants her students to succeed. Nothing is ever too hard, and she's always willing to help guide you",1
"I was completely dissatisfied. She lectured the entire class about things that were not pertinent to the material we were supposed to be covering. The tests were very hard & did not match the lectures. Her opinion was considered fact in her class, and if you tried to make a differing comment, she would either embarrass you or make you feel stupid.",0
We did labs every week. The final was worth 42% of the grade and that was the only test. She let us use a cheat sheet,1
Very full of herself and overall just a bad teacher. There was one exam that if you did not pass it she would take points off of another exam.,0
"Does not teach. Instead, he just does problems at his own pace during lecture as he talks to himself. Very hard to keep up with. And matlab was completely pointless and difficult. Also doesn't use Elms, which is very frustrating because you never know your exact grade in the class. Do not take",0
"Some course materials and assignments can be tedious but it is very easy to score well on them. She's super organized and clear about her expectations so as long as you follow what she says, it shouldn't be hard to get an A at all.",1
"Absolutely loved this class. She has a different, hands-on teaching style and is just a really nice person. I would take her again for sure!",1
"GUY WHO IS REALLY INTO HIMSELF, AND THAT DOES NOT HELP...",0
"One of my first Professors at Harper. She is amazing. Her homework and lectures are straight. i.e you will get an A if you learn. If you can't pass the class or find programming is too difficult, I suggest you shouldn't take higher-level CS classes after CSC121. Take time to practice and learn more.",1
She's awesome. Yay Judie!,1
"Mrs. Jafroodi is very enthusiastic about Biology.  She really loves her job.  She goes out of her way to help her students succeed.  I transferred to Appalachian State, but if I had the opportunity to take a class with her again I would in a heartbeat.  She is great!",1
He is AWFUL!!,0
"I failed the course, she is one of the worst professors you can have. Her test/quizzes are the hardest things that you will ever write. Despite getting 100% on the assignments, I failed both the midterm and final. She doesn't cover half the stuff that she puts on the exams. Also added 4 chapters of another textbook to our final. AVOID IF POSSIBLE!",0
"One of the best math professors in the department. If you get the chance to take her, take her!! She responds to emails super fast, and you could tell that she wants the best for her student. Make sure to attend her lectures or watch her lecture videos because that alone will help you significantly.",1
Avoid him if possible. I was sick and missed one class on a quiz day and it completely ruined my grade. He told me he would work with me and then the end of the semester came and he acted like he didnt know me. Told me not to worry about my grade because its in the past. Dont even try emailing him because he will not respond.,0
"Mrs. Ryan I would have to say is hands down one of the best English professors.  Not only is she really nice but you can tell that she really cares and wants you to pass. When you talk to her about your essay she will tell you what to change for you to get an ""A"". She also allows you get fix your pass essays reach really help. ",1
"This class sucks, so much busy work it really is ridiculous. He punishes you for taking the class online by assigning needless papers!",0
"One of my favorite prof at this school for sure. He clearly knows what hes talking about, understanding  and clear on grading and assignments if you pay attention and take notes you will do well",1
"By far one of the worst and rudest profs that I have ever taken. Does not keep office hours appointments and is very condescending to anyone who isn't a scholar in calculus. Lots of homework and grading on ""major"" and ""minor"" exams is beyond confusing. Does belittle students during class if you ask a question.",0
First prof to make real sense of community policing.,1
"Caplan was a chill professor and made it easy to pay attention because he kept lectures interesting. However, there are only 3 exams and no other grades so if you do bad on one your grade is screwed for the entire class. He is also not very helpful when it comes to questions outside of class so any issues you have ask in class.",1
"He was a great teacher! Super lecture heavy but never had them on blackboard. The book would've helped so much more if I had actually read it. He tried to make lectures funny but his lectures are very boring the majority of the time. He's not very available outside of class, although he does ask for questions before every class.",1
This was an excellent class and I recommend it to anyone interested in algae or even just plants in general. Vinebrooke made it extremly interesting and class was never boring. There was a lot of work in the class so bewarned but he is a fiar marker and gives extenstions. Overal great prof!,1
"It took a while to get used to Harris' style. If you take offense easily, do not take his class! If you don't mind being the butt of a joke every once and a while, and have a good sense of humor, then you'll love his class. His lecture is indeed slow, he goes through every detail (this can be a positive for some). Tests are very manageable.",1
"Idk if its just the pandemic, but all your learning is done outside class times. During lecture you meet about the extra homework he has you do. Easily spend 8 hours a week on this class alone. You do learn a lot because reading the textbook is necessary and the textbook homework ranges 90-280 questions. Good luck with that.",0
"Rude and disrespectful man who degrades students. No set lesson plans, teaches on the fly and is not very organized. He degrades his class and makes them feel like little kids. Hardest marker you will ever have at StFX. Likes to give zeros. Hard to approach in his office and get annoyed when you ask for clarification and has no industry experience.",0
Pat is my favorite professor I've ever had. I thought that this would be a class that would be really hard because the syllabus is intimidating (15 page paper end of semester). But he is so funny and the easiest grader ever. All the quizzes and tests come directly from the PowerPoints he sends out and readings.,1
"This dude is the ""stuff"". Hilarious, inspiring. Hate mornings, took this guy for a 8am class. I have never been so happy with a choice before. Immediately in ""awake mode"" when you enter. Relates the ideas of the study to current events. gives small notes. A lot of ""hands off"" teaching. Biggest thing is studying for the midterm, and not slacking off",1
HE AWFUL HARDEST TEACHER AND WHEN IT COMES TO TESTS THAT IS YOUR ONLY GRADE AND THE STUFF ISNT EVEN IN THE POWERPOINTS FROM THE STUDY GUIDE IT IS A REQUIRED CLASS FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE SO UNLESS YOU LOVE ECON AND ARE GOOD AT IT DO NOT TAKE IT WITH HIM. WORST MISTAKE I EVER MADE!,0
Loved him as a person and attended his Falun Gong meetings. He just isnt a great lecturer and this is mainly because of his heavy accent.,1
Shes amazing! She makes it so easy to get in contact with her and gives fun assignments. Its obvious that she values her students and their work. Definitely one of the best!!,1
"I enjoyed the class, hated the instructor. She did nothing the whole semester. She put the assignments on canvas and then I never heard from her again the rest of the semester. If you need a class that is more structured with feedback on assignments, she is not the teacher for you!!!",0
"With out going to class you will fail. And study by going over the homework not reading the book. I really enjoy Dr. Steward, he is a good prof",0
I suspect he has retired but I just thought it would be cool to rate him from when I was a student in his department from 1995-1999. He was very challenging yet very rewarding and a sobering introduction to the world of high expectations. I remember him as being very convinced of his grasp on almost every subject and rather demanding of students.,1
"Although Judy is very knowledgable and an extremely nice lady, I found her lectures were very confusing. She was constantly flipping back and forth between pictures of notes, pictures of the textbook, and pictures of practice question solutions. Instead of actually teaching the material she would just skim over it.",0
This professor did a good job of teaching the concepts to a class of Arts students that hadn't done math since grade 11. He gives you opportunities to boost your mark with the assignments so make sure you do all of them! Only downfall is he doesn't do any sort of review before the exams so it is up to you to try and figure out what he expects.,1
"Expects you to know everything beforehand. There are three take home exams, but if you don't understand the material, you won't pass the class. He doesn't even teach the formulas he gives you - he expects you to read the textbook, which he wrote with a fellow Professor, and the textbook doesn't even break it down. Avoid taking this class if you can",0
"easy A. projects are easy. She's a little spacy, but a great person. Easy with deadlines. EC a lot.TAKE HER!!!",1
Great instructor. Wish she taught more classes in the department!,1
"Burnap can't see very well, which isn't his fault, but it means his handwriting is almost impossible to read. The class is very complex anyway, so you want as much clarity as possible. His lectures aren't bad, but the subject matter can be dry. The tests are very hard (class avg was like a 60), and there's a lot of homework to get through each week",0
Avoid Dr. Kim. She is INTENSE. She doesn't understand that not everyone wants to get their masters in chemistry. She rushes through complex subjects because they are easy to her. She said that other professors make her life hard because they dont teach what she teaches. She was rude to me when I went to her office. She is a VERY tough grader.,0
"She's hilarious and really adorable, but sometimes she moves very fast. Large classes suck because it's hard for her to make sure everyone is caught up. A lot of the time I have trouble following along. Apparently so does the rest of the class.",0
"Kinda cool u know, will talk to himself once in a while but mostly, all right. IS easy simple, not that u don't have to study. Future failures listen to him he's actually a good teacher",1
"not really a good professor, he is not boring, but not really that interesting either.  tests were pretty hard.  attendance is very mandatory and based on clicker questions, I had a really bad illness and missed some classes and it dropped me from a B+ to a B-",0
"Dr. Green is a great professor who understands that COVID-19 means classes won't be conventional. His zooms are a bit long (2.5 hrs 1x/week) but he covers all the bases and makes sure we feel prepared. If you can't read 4-8 different medium-long texts/week, group work, multiple media essays, or in-depth discussions this class isn't for you.",1
best prof. at bentley. really entertaining and informational at the same time. 3 papers plus an extra credit paper. super easy definitely take!!,1
"Tough grader, stumbles over her words. Doesn't explain assignments ",0
"She's nice but she grades material waaaaaay too hard.  There many ways to compose business letters but if you don't do it exactly how she thinks it should be, your grade will suffer!",1
"I wouldn't recommend her online EDU104 class to anyone. She doesn't respond to emails  in a timely manner, and when she replies it sounds like she thinks you're stupid. It also seems like she thinks this class is the only class you're taking and you have no other responsibilities. ",0
"Clear grading criteria for papers but that's about all that's clear. Lectures get tangential, exams have material that was never covered, and don't hold your breath waiting for him to return papers with feedback. If you don't participate in class, he'll knock off points from your final grade (e.g., an A- will become a B+). At least he's nice.",0
"Very fun guy, and interesting discussions in class. Class typically lasts only 30 minutes. first half of semester is reading short stories (very simple) then just talk about it in class. I only had to write 2 papers (only 750 words) the whole semester. second half of semester is reading short poetry (simple). It really is just a discussion class.",1
"mean, rude to students, make sure you agree with her or else",0
"All the class is about the tests, but requires homework and turning in scratch paper from all assignments. No real in class instruction.",0
Time is not enough to finish the exam. I really do not recommend him. Avoid!,0
"Franco is the best. He knows the texts and thinkers he teaches but he welcomes divergent opinions in student interpretation. Tough grader, great guy.",1
"She'll make you feel horrible! She will insult you. You'll feel like you don't have what it takes to become a teacher. Honestly, the meanest teacher ever. She made so many people cry. She's the hardest person to please too.",0
Literally you only need to go to lab. I never went to lecture and got an A. Everything (I mean everything) is online on MyITLab so if you do the online homework you will be totally fine in the class. He will also curve EVERY exam and will give you the answers if you ask for help. 10/10. Other profs make you present your websites but he doesn't.,1
What a rediculous little man. He is boring and horribly unfunny. He completely turned me off sociology. Most people only go to class to get the assignments. I bring a a and CD player so I don't have to listen to him talk. His midterms are impossible but the assignments are easy.,0
"If you don't want to learn, don't take this class. He gives a lot of information so for some it may be overwhelming. As long as you pay attention you'll ace the class. I don't understand why people say he treats students like idiots when they ask question, I though he was very helpful, but I can see his personality being taken the wrong way.",1
Her class is hard if you don't study everyday. Read the chapter before class so you can understand the material when she discusses it. DON'T just study the exam study guides you will fail.Study the Objectives &know EVERYTHING  on them! study like your life depends on it I did this and I still made a C :(,1
"I have taken a class with Dr. Hunt before and I loved her, but online format is not for her. If you can avoid taking an online class with her, DO IT! She posts way too much material and expects us to do it all within a week so she can post another quiz or exam for us to take. She does not answer emails and decided to do zooms at very random times",0
I had the professor last year and had a very poor experience. He got angry that the class because we failed to participate when he asked us a question and threw his headset on the table and stormed out. He did come back a few minutes later to continue. Embarrassed multiple student for simply asking a question(reason for the lack of participation).,0
"Avoid him and save yourself a free fall in your GPA. He does not teach, he reads slides and will waste time in class talking about unrelated material and spend 2 lectures of 6 hours to do one chapter. The last class before the final we did 4 chapters plus one chapter to study on our own. Before the midterm we did 3 chapters in one lecture!",0
"The subject was brutal for me, but fortunately, Prof Cheng wasn't the reason it was difficult. He is incredibly passionate about teaching and the subject and will always be willing to answer questions. He is incredibly strict during quizzes and exams (at least online), but that easily dismissed. He keeps lectures engaging which was helps you focus.",1
He's very funny and knows how to make the class interesting..never once was i bored..if any other teacher were to teach this class it would be boring..,0
"Awesome teacher,always willing to make you a better writer!  Grades hard, but only makes you better!  I love her!",1
"Took LFS250 with him, and thought that was the worst he could do. Prepare for LFS350, cuz he would give you even more unorganized course websites, even more confusing wordings in online quizzes, and assignments that are totally waste of your time.",0
"Stoner is very long winded and hard to follow. A third of his tests are quizzes, the other on the lectures, and you have to write a paragraph about a definition. Only take if required, I'm struggling to even get a B. Very knowledgable though and very kind. Gives quizzes every day on chapters and chapters  of reading so you have to come. ",0
She is really sweat. Make sure you don't miss your quizzes because she will not let you make it up.,1
"Great TA. Super awkward, but doesn't mean too. No one talked in the class so she had no idea what to do. She does take attendance with a sign in sheet. I went up to her saying I was doing pretty bad (C) because of the test and she asked if i needed extra credit. Bumped up my grade. Very caring, very cool.",1
"You have to teach yourself and do homework before class THEN he'll go over the homework and kind of lectureteach.  The class bore me to tears and honestly can't say that I learned and retained anything that was ""taught"" in class.  I need to retake the class and saw that he was teaching again... Yeah. I'm heading to another campus.  ",0
Class was boring. I felt like I was having to teach myself the material out of the book,0
"She talked the whole 55 minute class every MWF. She is a talker for sure, gives quizzes at the end of every chapter. Her test are matching, multiple choice, and maps. She is super nice and does not take attendance but don't miss unless you  must. You will miss a lot of information. She gives out study guides for each chapter.",1
"I took Chem 102 with Prof. Organian a few years back and really learned a lot from her. Sadly, she has passed. RIP professor and thanks for the A grade.",1
Do not take this class unless you are extremely passionate about writing poetry. 90% of your grade relies on the poetry you write. Everyday is the same routine which gets boring. The prompts are difficult and bringing in poems every week sounds relatively easy but isn't unless you can manage work for all your classes.,0
"a great teacher is one whose presence and character earns the respect of their students, causing them to do their best so as to not lose the teacher's respect. i started off caring what HE thought and ended up caring for its own sake. students intersted in a real college class should take one of his",1
"Rambles, coming late to class, full of himself. He doesn't make you work too much because he's busy doing his own stuff. He's like a teenager, talking you 'bout himself trying to show that he's too smart for you/ But neither teaches nor inspires to learn.",0
"Yes he makes you work for it, but isn't that the point of learning. He helps you and answers all questions except not during the exam, that's the point, in exams it is us who are being tested after all. The most entertaining and fun I class I had this year. And the Group Projects were awesome. ",1
"Lectures are long and boring. Extremely biased- from the examples he makes to the comments he makes on papers. He is no doubt a qualified logic professor but is a disaster at conveying any sense of importance, enthusiasm or competence for Modern Philosophy. Extremely tough grader, and doesn't appreciate other views of the text other than his own.",0
"Content that is tought is clear but the concepts need to be practiced in order for them to sink in. very good teacher other than the fact that ""you can do everything anyway you want""",1
"Tracy is my favorite professor I have had so far at HSU. She is so funny and inspiring and is always willing to help you with your papers. She gives great feedback and makes her lectures interesting. Take her TV themed english class like I did and you will not be sorry. Because of Tracy, I passed with distinction on my portfolio.",1
she is the sweetest! if you need psych 1 Dr. Guimberteau is the one ya'll.,1
"The homework is really easy, but the tests are really hard. She doesn't make her tests, since they are through connect so it is not really her fault. She answers emails quickly and has lectures on youtube if you need them.",1
"While Vetrano tries to sympathize with students by telling tales of his own, I many times find it difficul to follow his lesson and his teaching stile where little or no participation is expressed by students. What strikes me the most is his little will to help me afterclass. He would often brag at me first that he had explained that during class.",0
"I would not take her. She makes things difficult on purpose, and for no reason. The class is very boring and there's a lot of weekly work.",0
"One of the worst classes I have ever taken, don't waste your time taking this as a gen ed or even in general. The professor is not understanding at all when it comes to grading and attendance. Extremely disorganized.",0
Hatcher is a very smart professor and is knowledgeable about all math. The lectures were a little scattered and there was homework pretty much every day. The tests were graded hard and you could miss a lot of points for little things. Beware of proofs,0
"I took Dr Burton's class in the middle of covid, so I can't say how he is otherwise, but the course was asynchronous and we would often go weeks without hearing from him. When we did, he'd give us resources to links that were expired or broken and then graded very harshly. At the end, we found out he was skiing in Colorado all semester...",0
"Nice lady. Quiz every 2 weeks, based off of the outline and book. Exam every 2 weeks, which are easy if you know how to take online exams (hint).",1
"This guy is the most dry, boring professor I have ever had. He makes me dread going to a class that is supposed to be more interactive and hands on. He has 0 personality and speaks with the same monotone voice the whole hour and a half. Zzzzzz...",0
He asks questions and answers and hard to get into the flow of things for a while. This is not my first English class  or my first degree and found it was interesting material and enjoyed the reading but compelled to put the word out he will give you a low grade on papers.,0
"Dr. Rankin did not know her own material but expected students to recall random historical facts that she briefly read during lectures. She is monotone and does not show much enthusiasm in her teachings. Additionally, she did not seem to want students to succeed. Her exams did not give students enough time and the expected average was always 60%",0
"worst professor I have ever had. lectures are lifeless and consists of him debugging his code or silently searching through the textbook because he is ill-prepared everyday. homeworks are impossible if you don't ask questions, vague requirements yet harsh grader. He just doesn't care anymore, and it transfers over to his students.",0
"Completely inaccessible both in and outside of class. Content is not bad, but the way she teaches the class makes it so hard to understand anything. Course load is so heavy. I basically put as much effort in this course as I put in other 4 together. She is arrogant and rude in class. Adomait level 10.0",0
Basically tested over his own opinions as well as readings that he liked.,0
"Lecture everyday, Daily Quizzes, Weekly Homeworks, 2 midterms and a final. Was not considerate considering we are 100% online learning, very easy to get burnout as she expects us to spends hours on the class each day. She also only teaches using examples, which is hard to learn from and follow since she doesn't explain the process before hand.",0
"Does not help you. He presents his information and tests (of which there are only two) and expects you to have it at! Got a C on a paper for messing up ONE citation and having an ""awkward sentence."" Not kidding. This guy is a good man and would be a great teacher if he set out guidelines for success. Avoid if you care about GPA or like success.",0
"Goes on 90 minute tangents and then asks you questions about the material he didn't cover.
 Likes to give test questions where the answer is non-obvious.",0
"I took him for Deviant Behavior and Social Problems. They are basically the same. He talks and rants the whole class, you don't have to really take notes. Tests are multiple choice, kind of hard, you just have to read the text book. He gives pop quizzes so that you will have to come to class and read along in the textbook.",1
He's a great teacher who loves to include his humor during lectures.  He reminds me of Kip from the movie Napoleon Dynamite.,1
"Most caring professor I have had in a while. Genuinely wants his students to do well, and although his quizzes are hard, he will help you get the best grade possible (if you go to him with questions). Love him!",1
"Really interesting lectures and clearly passionate and knowledgeable about what he teaches. The projects in HIS3328 not only reflected what we were learning in readings and lectures, but gave us a chance to explore different kinds of primary sources and engage with the history we were learning. 10/10 recommend.",1
"Mr. Pentek is a great teacher, some think he comes off condensing but its just his dry humor. He is a caring teacher, but he wants to make sure you know the material. The material is very hard and he tries to go in depth as best as possible. He is one of the toughest teachers but hes worth it. FYI know the Wiggers Diagram like the back of your hand",1
Will never take a course from him again. one of the hardest classes I've taken. He is hard to understand due to his accent and he doesn't even know half the time what he is teaching. he does try to be helpful but its almost impossible to pass...,0
"Awful teacher! Rude, unprofessional, & completely uninterested in teaching this class. No wonder people don't enter the field of sp. ed! Dresses in tacky attire. Does not teach, prefers to read from ppts. Makes Ben Stein sound like an awesome public speaker. Yes, her voice is THAT bad! Not clear in assignment expectations. HCC should be ashamed!!!",0
"Really just an amazing professor and person. You watch a lot of documentaries on music and learn all about music history in a way that's really interesting. There are a few quizzes, a midterm, and a final. HOWEVER, he does all he can to prepare you for these. He's connected in the music world, and can help with internships and advice.. MUST take!",1
"He gives good feedback on work, but don't miss any assignments. You will definitely have to put in effort in order to get a decent grade.",1
"Serva knows his stuff. PhD, been doing it for years. He is clear with what he expects and is helpful if you are struggling. But he is constantly busy, and tracking him down outside of class can be difficult. Gives you the grade you earn. Good guy to know at school as well, definitely recommend for any MISY class if you are willing to work.",1
"Good professor that teaches almost all of the content well, cares about knowledge of students",1
"She is so unorganized and the slowest lecturer. She literally gave out the wrong test to everybody and was teaching a whole other psychology class in 3100. she says her tests are ""not memorization its application"" but so is just about every other class in college and yet it is the hardest class I have taken.",0
"Prof Nadel starts lecture by writing ambiguous, barely legible words on the board, barely clarifies, talks about things of little to no relevance. He is very hard to listen to as you never really know where he is going with any thought. Little to no lecture structure, and admits he makes up some of his lectures on the drive to school. worst.",0
"Absolutely awful professor. Does not teach any of the concepts at all and barely goes over examples or questions. On the quizzes and tests, there are questions that we have never even heard of or concepts that have never even been slightly mentioned. The class is awful and as a Math Major, I have not learned a single thing from her.",0
snooty and boring,0
"This guy is a horible prof. Grading system is picked out of a hat. The books teach you squat, I kept up with the reading and did all of the work. He lost my paper, and gave me a B. Person sitting next to me did nothing and made an A. I think you need to shmooze him a little to get a good grade.",0
"Took him for film and lit.  This guy is the greatest professor at nassau.  I would take any of his classes.  Truly passionate, understanding, helpful, and inspiring. If you think I'm overduing it, then you haven't had a hellish experience with a professor yet.  This guy is the man. Pronounce his name ""Dongello"" and he will love you for it.",1
Great course. Viewed policy and social issues from intersectional perspective. Worked in groups online and my group was proud of the work. Taking the course changed my view on some social policies.,1
"I really enjoyed this class. Kate certainly has a passion for Art Architecture history and it shows. Even when describing seemingly boring details, she showed enthusiasm. Very informative lectures in which I learned a lot. I enjoyed going to lecture!! Expect essay quizzes short papers and a timeline project. I would recommend taking this class.",1
"Definitely an easy class. Kind of annoying and tedious at time, but interesting nonetheless. Weekly two page papers are almost always opinion based and super easy, and the tests aren't terrible as long as you do the study guide.",1
Prof Allen overall just sucks. He's arrogant and inconsiderate to the fact that this is not everyones first priority and mostly everyone only take his class to fulfill a gened. He gives super long boring lectures that no one understands unless you're an expert in Refugee crisis's. Do not take this class unless you have the time to do excess work,0
This professor is SUPER strict on grading. I took the elementary math class for education majors and the class isn't a normal math class. The point is to learn how to explain math to children. But if your explanation isn't PERFECT then he takes points away. He even told my friends class that nobody makes 100s. TRUST ME CHOOSE ANOTHER PROFESSOR!!!!!,0
I recommend to not take any classes by him. He is such a tough grader in classes that are intro and expects you to know everything about the topic. Let alone he lists his criteria and if you follow it at best you would get 3/10 he expects you to go above and beyond. Most people end up failing his class or devoting all their time to it.,0
"Amazing professor! He made me, someone who never liked art, into someone who can appreciate it now.  Here is how you get an A: go to all classes, participate (VERY IMPORTANT), and show you care.  I think I had a final and midterm with a quiz or two in the middle.  Also presentation that is on a topic of your choice.  No textbook, save money.",1
"Confusing, unorganized, does not know what she wants.  She has no guidelines for assignments but when she gets it, and if it doesn't meet her imaginary standard, she penalizes you.  Her online portion had no focus, her lectures had no focus, and she rambles.  Take her if you like being confused, otherwise... skip it.",0
"This guy could probably trick me into being interested in anything. Obviously very caring and informative. One thing is that he's pretty old fashioned and uses impressionistic grading, so if you need a very clear cut rubric and syllabus this won't work for you.",1
"Terrible. And no, I'm not someone who received a bad grade and is holding a grudge. She's not good at teaching the material and sitting through 90 minutes of class with her was a horrible and boring experience.",0
If you run into technology issues he will not provide an opportunity for you to make it up. If you email him about a quiz that won't open and he says not to worry about it till a later date... worry about it- he won't think twice about changing the due date and holding you accountable for not taking it despite your emails.,0
"Dr. Joe was an amazing professor who helped me understand science the way my high school teachers couldn't. His lectures are very long and informative, but he keeps you laughing and engaged. He's happy to help (when you ask for it), and he treats everyone with respect. His essay questions are tough, but studying will help you IMMENSELY.",1
"Professor Bardo is great! He is very caring and truly wants the best for all his students. He always asks students for feedback. For participation points just writing him a note and telling him what you thought about the class counted. Your grade is made up of participation, an essay, midterm, and final (both exams are online).",1
"This professor is so unorganized. The quizzes are suppose to unlock on sundays for 24 hours but he doesn't post them and will post them randomly at a later time, making you miss the quizzes. He doesn't require a textbook and his video lectures are painful to watch. He makes you read articles for the text all written by him.",0
"Dr. Walter's is one of the best professors I've had at Stony Brook. She's knowledgeable of all of the books, and allows you great insight to the assigned literature. SHE IS VERY FAIR. Grades are not given but rather EARNED. I participated, had good attendance, and had great papers so I did well. If you are not clear about material, go to her hours.",1
"The worst teacher I have had in my college career.  I am not the best at math, and immediately sought out help for the class.  She repeats the same information over and over again in lecture, barely making it through half of what is required.  Went to office hours for help and she insulted my intelligence for not understanding. She is rude, no help",0
"There tended to be confusion on the grading scale often. Rogers course was simply laid out, PowerPoint then group quiz. There was a research paper at the end of the course. She is a difficult women to get ahold of. On the plus side, she is incredibly good natured- she jokes and allows for discussion within the class.",1
"AVOID her unless you absolutely can't. Super strict about attendance and being on time. Does not use canvas at ALL, not even to post grades. No powerpoints for notes, just her talking. Exams were very difficult, they are written/mc. No extra credit or ways to bring your grade up. Only 3 exams and paper. Can't miss more than 1 class. Way too hard.",0
"Don't take it, Just don't... He's not a nice guy nor a good professor",0
"Lazy Professor. He teaches an online class, and won't give you any notice whenever a test becomes available. You are supposed to have every test date memorized from your syllabus. Seems like he doesn't care about his students.",0
"Not an ""easy A"" class but she's a good professor. Funny at times and has a lot of interesting things to say about the subject. If you work hard you should do well.",1
"very approachable, very fun-great guy",1
"Feikes is really nice guy, but i wasn't fond of the way he taught his class this semester. he just seems so over whelmed since he became department head. i wish he would have collected homework for a grade like any other teacher since he has us do it every night anyways. i just felt like we rushed through everything. i wish someone else taught 137.",1
"Humber is one of the nicest profs I've met, but I hated taking MATH 213 with him. He wasn't prepared to teach for two hours straight. I found his lectures very difficult to engage with, which was unfortunate because the textbook was not helpful either. His homework was really difficult, but tests and quizzes were easy.",0
"This was the weirdest class I've ever taken.  Still not sure what kind of geography it was.  Dr. J is hilarious and actually talks about interesting things.  Textbook homework was absurd, but necessary because the tests were half open book.  The key is to not leave the homework until last minute.  Easy A if you do all of the assignments.",1
Agree that she is narrow-minded and doesn't respond to challenging questions. It's like she didn't speak the same language as the students.  but then..She wouldn't let me go to the restroom during the final!I held it for 2 hours! I'm seeking formal action against this prof.,0
Positive review to UMO and they gave her Gold. Can they take back the award? She is responsible for telling students about career opportunities that are not real. By the way on GEOlogy homework don't cite any rocks not found Exactly where she said or you will fail. She prefers handwritten work if you use a computer to print something you fail hotTA,0
"I would not take this professor again if someone paid me. She very often makes mistakes during her lectures, which in mathematics is a huge deal. She will make a mistake and if a student does not point it out she will not fix it. She speaks to her students in a  derogatory tone as well. Horrible professor, DO NOT TAKE HER.",0
"The only grades in the class are three tests, so if you do bad you're screwed. Also, the lectures are rarely actually finished in class because he welcomes too many tangential questions. He also has office hours which act as another lecture, if you don't go you will miss out on lots of information that he doesn't cover in class.",1
Great knowledgeable guy and his lectures are interesting! But EXAMS ARE TOUGH- you MUST read and attend class. Exams have essays that he wants to have 20 different details and be long written with little time to do that and finish multiple choice questions. He also calls out the person who wrote best essay after exams grades to read it to the class,1
"Extremely boring. Struggles to connect with her audience. Reads the overhead slides in a soft, monotone voice.",0
"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS AS AN ELECTIVE. 5 long papers, one midterm, a presentation, and 15 journal entries. Shannon Roper made our lives a living hell. Class is way harder than it needs to be. Unless you need Gender to graduate, pick a different elective and save the headache. She also rambles until the very last second of every class.",0
"She shows inappropriate films for the age group. She is lazy and not tech savvy at all. You don't get any feedback until it's too late, she also has mixed material for the class. I took as an elective, she calls herself a ""historian"", I'm glad she's ancient history for me. This class is boring and serves no benefit, not even to a history major.",0
Legit don't go to her class all the lectures are online and the exams are easy.,1
"In my opinion, the worst professor out there. He is really immature. Acts like some kind of stand up comedian. Says **** jokes. Found him **** on campus and acting like a ****(Many witnesses). Tests are a joke. They are all opinion based. No right or wrong answers. He assigns you a random grade out of the blue.",0
"Prof. Masterson is not a mean man, but is a terrible prof. I am a decent math student and this class was extremely difficult for me. He talks very low (both in volume and pitch), which makes it difficult to focus. The test questions were 10x harder than the examples in class and if you didn't solve it exactly his way he would mark it wrong.",0
"Some of the exam questions on her test were confusing and debatable.  The final essay prompt was very confusing along with a few other assignments, plus she sometimes did not post the lecture notes until the night before.  However if you study the powerpoints and read the book you should do fine.",1
Awesome guy but bad prof. He teaches directly out of the text book which makes lectures extremly boring. Falling a sleep is inevitable. CAPA assignements are dirty hard.,0
Maybe he is a better teacher in person but I have learned very little from this online course. Some problems are explained through videos but many of the videos are extremely confusing and unhelpful. Plus $80 for mandatory WebAssign membership even though the point of City College is to be free/cheap and accessible to all. Worst online course imo,0
"Prof. Sanders is willing to help. she sent out an email after the final asking if anyone wanted to come to look at their finals and because of this, my grade moved up a letter. her powerpoints are a bit disorganized but I never had trouble knowing what was on the test because it was going to be everything she would emphasize, no surprises here.",1
"Be ready to be yelled at for every single question or clarification you ask. She make you buy the textbook and the study guide but she rarely use them and keeps saying how the text book is wrong and she is the ""Goddess"" of the text and you should listen to her not the textbook. ",0
"It depends on personality type if you will like this professor. My class is a bunch of introverts, and she expects all of us to be awake and bubbly like her at 9am, and criticizes us every class period for not talking. Also, it didn't matter how long I spend on assignments, the grade is always a B. Make sure to do well on tests if you want an A!",0
I'm pretty certain Dr. Barton became a medievalist because he likes knights and dragons. He's such a fun professor to have and he never makes you feel bad about anything. Didn't do the reading? He's not gonna hate you for it. He's genuinely interesting and enthusiastic. Everyone should take one of his classes whether you're a history major or not.,1
Dr. Miller is perhaps the best teacher at PCC. He not only know his subject material but is also very inspirational and passionate. He makes his classes fun with jokes and real life stories that enhance the learning experience. I HIGHLY recommend you take him for any religion or philosophy class.,1
"Great professor, lectures are easy to follow. The textbook is only for the homework so you don't really need to buy it as long as you follow the in class powerpoints. Pretty lenient grader, Pay attention and study a little and you will get an easy A.",1
"Professor Hartgrove was an amazing lecturer, I enjoyed the way she explained ideas and provided examples. Taking her in person is much more enjoyable. She is known for being unorganized and it took her the entire semester to grade essays, however if you follow the guidelines you'll be fine. Textbook is required and can be used on quizzes and exams.",1
"Beware Doyle does not use brightspace or any online sources, if you want to pass the course you have to attend all lectures to get the material. Doyle gives all possible long answer questions for the midterms- practice those and you'll be fine. Both midterms consisted of 25 multiple choice and one 15 mark long answer.",1
Good teacher take notes and read,1
Overall I would have to say this was one of the worst professor I have had. It is nearly impossible to get in contact with him and his instructions for the lessons/class in general are not clear at all. I would say its a fairly easy class although the way he operates makes it horrible and confusing. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT take,0
"If you plan on grad school, you have to this sequence with Groisser. He teaches it like Real Analysis, and gives every student a glimpse of what true mathematics really is. He seems tough, but if you go to his office hours he is beyond caring and accommodating. His class was the toughest one I've ever taken, but I can't recommend him enough!",1
"His powerpoints are a little extreme, Idon`t know if all the information is necessary. Endless quizzes, assignments which all require sources and labs that take 4 days to complete. Exams consisted of reading roughly 250 slides filles top to bottom, a lot with useless blabber. No longer interested in security. Thanks.",1
Very boring and mono tone. Rambles on about the information yet doesn't seem to stress the important things that are needed for the test. Mostly overhauls the whole topic.,1
"Not helpful, not kind, and very very harsh grading, a bit on the unfair side. Unless you already know the material, you will definitely get a mediocre grade.",0
"loved him!! immunology was so enjoyable, and everyone did much better on his sections because he is clear and straightforward, bravo!",1
"Dr. McKenna was a great professor! She allowed for so much personal freedom when choosing topics for papers, and you could tell that she loves the subject she teaches. She always showed excitement for the material and excitement for what the students thought about the literature, films, and art we analyzed throughout the semester. One of the Best!",1
She was very unfair ! Made me redo a paper 3 times and didn't improve my grade . Don't chose this teacher ! Very unfair and mean !,0
Cogan is a very nice guy.  I thought this class was lots of fun and he's an easy grader!,1
"Lectures were sooo boring and he often did math problems wrong, so be prepared to teach yourself the material if you actually want to learn. His class was super easy because he did open book tests and test corrections, so an easy A if you try a little bit. However, we learned nothing about chem, just that acid rain and greenhouse gases were bad.",0
Went for one reason and left with a new understanding,1
Save yourself the miserable semester and C on your transcipt and take a different course. NOT AN EASY A. Tests have tons of biased/trick questions. Not based on memorization or clear facts from text.,0
This may be one of the hardest classes I have ever taken. You will have four exams that are Multiple choices which is very challenging and essay questions. You will also have three quizzes which are based on scholarly readings. If you want to pass this class be prepared for long nights of studying and make sure to attend all the classes.,0
"The most difficult class I've taken to date. The material is not that difficult but the workload is the real sucker. You WILL get behind on the assignments. READING THE BOOK IS ESSENTIAL to understand material, she is a great person in general, but in class expect to see strange equations and go home brain dead. Labs are also graded very strictly.",1
Do not take her. It will be a waste of your time.,0
"The professor is excellent at teaching this course. I took it as a Fast Track class combining Math 45 and Math 60 in one semester so each course was 8 weeks long. During fast track I will say there is a lot of homework to be done and it helps you do better on the quizzes and exams. Overall, I recommend this to anyone that wants to be done fast.",1
I had her my freshman year and I truly didnt realize how bad she was until my my sophomore year. I havent had a professor as mean and in-genuine since her and I wouldnt wish anyone to take her class. I wouldnt be surprised if all the good reviews about her on here were her rating herself because I dont see how anyone could enjoy her class.,0
"A very nice professor,  It really is an easy class, just do your work and do it on time.",1
I had an awful experience in this class and I highly recommend to avoid taking his class.,0
"I had Dr. Braun for Critical Reading/Writing & AYA Lit, which were both great classes. However, do not expect an A if you do not work for it. I am a straight A student & have only gotten an A- in both classes. Nothing is ever perfect in her eyes. Although, she will email you a hundred times to prepare you for presentations or papers! Very helpful!",1
"If you are not the greatest at math, of course this class might be hard. Professor Hess will take the time to help if you need it though. I enjoyed using thinkwell, because I can re-watch the videos. ",1
"Best professor I've ever had.  She made Calc II interesting, which encouraged her students' success.  It's sad to see her retire.  MCC is losing a tremendous asset.  She's still teaching Diff Eq this summer, so if you're thinking about taking it, register now!",1
"I have taken tons of online classes before,  but this one was by far the best. Super well organized and it was loaded with game features like points, badges, etc... Best class I have taken at Concordia period.",1
"This class just has a lot of ""on-your-own"" learning. There is a lot of homework, but that's not what makes the class not fun. Professor Rodriguez is very nice, but she doesn't give concrete answers when you ask her questions. She also is not good at responding to emails. I would try to take another professor for 301.",1
"Horrible tests, frequently asks questions that have two possible right answers. When you ask him to explain why one answer is right and the other wrong he just says ""that is what the textbook authors say and I agree with them"". Also the cumulative final covers 13 chapters equally weighted!",0
She is the best. African American Lit. Was great ! I highly recommend her,1
"Prof Jones likes to be called Randy. I took his Fine Art class and WSU Tri-Cities. While attendance was mandatory, you can really just zone out during class. He's really passionate about art and has some cool lecture points, but the lecture isn't at all in the exams. For the exam all that you need is re-read your hw which he corrects to perfection",0
"The content itself was very interesting, but that will stay constant for any second year social psych class, but it's not really on him. He was not accommodating to students, made the tests unreasonably hard (a lot of multiple choice exams asking for the ""best answers"") and was not helpful outside of lectures at all, often ignoring emails of ?'s.",0
Learn everything from the book and really high expectations. Class time is used for answering questions and doing group work.,0
"His online tests were given over blackboard so there was multiple choice but the free response questions were either right or wrong, no partial credit, since he didn't see your work. Very boring, long lectures and not much material to study from. Would not recommend taking an online class with Cook.",0
"Choose any other professor, literally any.",0
"Professor Starkman is a great professor who trys very hard to help students succeed. He is always willing to help outside of class and is happy to hold review sessions the night before the exam. During lectures, he does a significant amount of derivation that may confuse you , but textbooks are always helpful. Chaos lectures are interesting.",1
"Reads out of the book ONLY! Will not show you how to solve problems or put anything on the board. Asked her to show me how to solve a problem she said we didn't have time to do so. She said her self ""the class did bad on the quiz ,we are not having a quiz today because we are not grasping the material and we have to move on. "" DO NOT TAKE HER.",0
He's great in helping and directing student to achieve great goals to every student. Great sense of HUMOUR.... Great Guy,1
She is a tough grader and cares way too much about the assignments. She does not provide enough feedback on how to improve your grade and needs to be a little more relaxed.,0
"She might know her stuff, but she builds herself up a lot. She has a high, squeaky voice that's too loud and hard to take for an entire class. Professor Brenan is a much better teacher (Bus 107 and 108).",0
"LOVE Dr. Pierce and would absolutely take another class with her.  She's very helpful and understanding, and her tests are pretty simple.  She also gives excellent feedback.  Be sure to visit her office hours.",1
"He tries to make you think the class is hard but it isn't. His exams are easy and he's a fairly funny guy but the classes will bore you to death. If he's an option for you, take him. It's an easy A.",1
"Dorothy Fujimura is a tough teacher. Her lectures are based off of some examples from the textbook and then she assigns homework from the entire chapter so you have to teach yourself or go to tutoring. If she thinks you don't meet the algebra requirements she will ask you to leave her class. One midterm, 4 quizzes, and one final.",0
"If you have no prior physics background, this class will be impossible. I consider myself to be pretty smart and I was lost from day 1. Doesn't teach just tells you to do the example problems on your own. The tests are easy to fail because the multiple choice are 5 pts each and he barely gives partial credit on the open ended. Very tough class. ",0
Be ready to study on your own. Absolutely useless prof as he speeds through questions without explaining. Good luck.,0
"The class design makes grades heavily reliant on timed exams, which unfortunately are on applications of the assignments which no student would understand unless a student has taken the course or some equivalent before.  This places students who don't have the proper background at a disadvantage.  I learned a lot, but I'm worried about my grade.",0
"very helpful, funny, understanding",1
"One of the best professors I've had in college so far. His classes are tough, but he really cares about his students and incorporates real life business aspects into his lectures.",1
"Horrid, run for your life!  He loves the smart kids, but thinks those who aren't good at chemistry are destined to be stupid.  Insulting in class if you ask a less than brilliant question.  Very hard to talk to outside of class.  Seriously, he's an ass. Take someone else.",0
"Her lectures were dry and boring . As long as you show up and hand in the work you can get a solid B or A. She is a tough grader and gives a lot of handouts, fyi.",0
"I eventually stopped going to class because his lectures were awful and just read the book. The material is very interesting, but Kubelka ruins it by reading off a ""wall of text"" powerpoint derived from the book. He rarely ""teaches"" because he lacks the intuition and clarity to do so effectively. His online homework is a mess of errors.",0
I have this class as a requirement and is hard she gives lots to study over the weeks and when you try to contact her she misses you or not respond. I wouldn't take her at all get another class people. Most of the work is online but if you don't pass the test in person forget it.,0
"Worst ever~
 he is qualified as a prof. plz retire, renoid.",0
"Roger was amazing. He was such a caring, charming man. Very helpful. If you mentioned to him you were unable to pass in an assignment on time he wasn't worried whatsoever. His exams are almost exactly like his practice ones. Made the class extremely easy.",1
"Good at taking questions. Explains things clearly. Slight Polish accent. Good sense of humour. Tests are no joke, study. Every week after the test, you're going to hear something like: ""The class average was 20%.""",1
"She reads off her power points must of the time and will end up talking about random things not related to the lecture. She makes students sign their name on paper and write down the time they arrived for class for attendance. Her lectures are extremely boring but she'll try to be funny. Theres 3 midterm, 1 final, 1 presentation, 1 research paper.",0
Dr. Salano is an awesome dude and a good teacher. if you do the work your gonna get an A. i got a B but i suck at school. great guy though.,1
"Excelent teacher, excelent person!!! Take him!!!",1
"He's amazing! You can tell he really enjoys talking about the history of Louisiana even though he's actually not from here. Basically gives the test answers day before the test and no way you can fail this class. Only thing, I just wish he was more clear about due dates.",1
Recommend taking him during the summer. It's an easy summer course. 1 essay a week about 5 or so pages. He makes you write  journals for hw but they take 10 minutes at most. Easy summer class. Learned a lot. Boring class though. EASY B and if you try then easy A.,1
"He talks down to his students; it feels like you're in elementary school. All of the assignments are busy-work. He tries to lead discussions, but they always fizzle. Very boring, poorly organized, and too many assignments you don't learn from.",0
Best chemistry professor I ever had!,1
You use the textbook a lot! Teacher does not put in as much effort as the students. Teacher uses the excuse of forgetting to grade assignments or is busy. The syllabus is outdated along with written assignment requirements. It is the last week of the semester and this class is still waiting for feedback on their final assignment.,0
"Hilarious professor! Love him as a person, but not as a professor. Doesn't teach. Every class was not relevant to the homework AT ALL so do HW during class. His accent wasn't bad, but there is a language barrier. If you had a question, he'd try to answer it but you end up more confused than when you started. You'll get an A with YouTube and Chegg.",0
Floyd is my favorite Marketing professor that I have had. He is so clear with what he is looking for. He tells you exactly what is on the quizzes and there are no surprises. He's also just a cool dude,1
The final was awful. Only 45 minutes for a 40 question final. I rushed the last 10 minutes and received a B. Not at all satisfied and I was so stressed out and under pressure due to the time limit,0
Professor Gaidos is a great professor! He is easy going and very understanding. You get graded on a few things but he is very clear on what material needs to be covered in order for you to succeed. You are definitely able to pass with an A as long as you follow his criteria. He makes the class interesting with weekly discussions and is humorous.,1
"If you want to understand math, take her. If you are a first time college student or someone returning to school I recommend her. She doesn't move on until everyone understands the criteria. She's very nice. Have to buy the book. She is awesome.",1
I  would highly reccomend avoiding her at all cost. She is SUPER rude and made pretty much half my class feel dumb by interrupting and calling them out during the middle of group presentations. She has no problem shutting down anything you say and her tests are super particular. It's a shame because it could be a fun class but she made me dread it!,0
"One of my favorite professors. Super funny and interesting, but this class is not for the easily offended. He purposely will say stuff to get a rise out of people, which is really funny if you don't take it too seriously. Attendance is mandatory or you lose points. Grading is based on papers, which are long and tedious, but straightforward.",1
"He is extremely intelligent and knows the subject of Existentialism and Phenomenology very well. He has taught me how to be a far better writer, than I thought that I was. He says weird stuff and keeps our attention in this late afternoon class. But he uses them as examples of things that we are interested in and can relate to. This class is fun!",1
This class is eye opening and meant to help student development their educational philosophy. It can be hard to speak up in class because some topics are very controversial. However keep an open mind and look through a different 'lens' and you'll be find. He curves the test grades by ALOT! I think he is a good professor.,0
Cool dude and full of life and tons of knowledge,1
"Professor Ferguson is the sweetest and wisest professor I have come across to date. It is clear that she cares so deeply for her students, not only academically but personally as well. She may share many personal anecdotes, but those are specifically what help us remember important teachings in class. She is empathetic, kind, and an absolute joy.",1
"Professor McCrory is one of the best professors I have had while at IU! His lectures are engaging and full of helpful information. This class isn't a blow off class at all, but I actually really enjoyed going to class and the material that was taught. He also gives great examples during class to help you understand.",1
She never responded to any emails. If you skip more than 2 or 3 classes your grade will suffer immensely. Not very understanding about technological issues or absences. She doesn't accept Dr's notes either. Pointless class with only busy work.,0
"Mark definitely knows his stuff, it's just the way he is presenting that is awful about his teaching. He spends an entire slide, literally 20 mins on one specific slide and talks about it while no one is paying attention. He then goes on to the other more important slides and skips over them in a couple of minutes, even seconds!",0
"For CSC 116, take any professor but Balik. During lectures, she reads off of PowerPoint slides which are unhelpful. The wait for her office hours is extremely long. The tests are very hard and the content learned in class does not prepare you for them. You have to teach yourself the content otherwise it is easy to fall behind in the class.",0
"man has a great voice, 10/10 on the voice really, everything else is a solid 2/10 though, so get ready to teach yourself the content.",0
"Dr. Tyler is an outstanding teacher. I took calc BC in highschool, got a 4 and kept a 89 in his class throughout the year. Ended on an A. If your not willing to put in the effort you might struggle, but coming to class is necessary to his class. I'm taking 8am classes everyday just so I can have this professor again. He's like the cute old grandpa.",1
"The classes were okay but her emails are really rude. Falsely accused a lot of my friends of cheating and academic dishonesty with her ""so called evidence"" that does not even prove anything. the tests were moderate, she narrows down the short answers to some topics.",0
She has you write about a 400 word paper every week. They way grades are given is really strange (a 90% is a B+). 2,1
Worst professor I ever had.  His exams are extremely difficult because his questions are very in-depth in much that the textbook or his notes does not even cover.  You must already have prior knowledge to do well in his class which is idiotic.,0
"If you think you are serious about journalism, she will make or break you. Her expectations are high but clearly expressed. Many people who complain about her editing on here are terrible writers and don't realize it; be prepared to take writing (in newspaper format) seriously. If you want to write news, she's your girl.",1
Do not listen to the idiotic bad rep in here. Schufreider is a ray of light in the academia i.e. institutionalized Cultural-Marxism. The man's aged mind exemplifies the clarity of an eagle's eye. Knows his material like the back of his hand. Loves Nietzsche and Kierkegaard. The best lecturer I've ever had and ever expect to. Highly recommended.,1
"Lectures are long, does not explain material well. Does not give clear expectations. Answers emails fast. Book is useless, he provides a free pdf version.",0
The most approachable professor I've had. He cares about students and is even willing to help outside of the class. I would recommend him to other students.,1
"Feurzeig is intelligent and has a ton of valuable information on music literature and history. That being said, I personally did not enjoy her teaching style. The lectures are EXTREMELY dry and long. It is not always clear as to what is expected of you. Not very approachable.",0
He is one of the best.,1
"Jan made me love art and the history of it. She gives a lot of information. However, she understand and care for her students. I was always get C in my exams, but woth the extra credits I got an A-. I cant describe how great she is, best professor ever.",1
Horrible Horrible teacher! Puts things in test that are never covered in class or even mentioned! Take at own risk!! I don't know how this teacher got 1 good review.,0
"Great professor who knows his stuff, brings stories in from his own life of being a journalist and a lawyer. Learned so much! Good class if your interested in the law too.  Always willing to help!",1
"Others comments on Hansen are very accurate.  It is clear she attempts to ""scare"" students in an attempt to hide her own insecurities.  She outright degrades students and if continues in her current actions, will eventually get BSOL sued under the ADA or other.  Ms. Hansen ignores the BSOL handbook, and embarrasses BSOL in conduct and appearance.",0
My only complaint about this course were the quizzes.  There were 7 quizzes made up of multiple choice questions; each had 5 questions and a time limit of 10 minutes. 10 minutes was never enough time because the questions were long-winded and somewhat confusing. The quizzes alone resulted in me getting a B in this course.,1
"I totally agree with all the responses...just dont do it. the tests and projects arent hard BUT going to class is a must and that is the HARDEST part, trust me... waste of your time",0
"Hard class, but you should be capable to pass.  If you can avoid taking him, do it.  His accent is thick and hard to understand, especially in the beginning.  I thankfully had the opportunity to take the class taught by 2 different instructors, and definitely learned and retained more from the other instructor.",0
Worst professor I've ever had. Had him for Pentateuch and gospels in the same semester. His opinion is always right and if you disagree he will laugh at you. His assignments are ridiculous and he doesn't explain them. I am an A student and I got C's in both classes. He assigns a ridiculous amount of work and acts like his classes are the only ones,0
Sytsma was not very helpful when students asked questions. Be prepared to read the book and pay attention when he says something from his lecture will be on the exam. ,0
Zedel is a funny guy but he has no idea what's on the go 90% of the time. He encourages questions but is rarely about to coherently answer them. He fools around a lot. He always admits he's unprepared for the lecture and slaps something together last minute. He wastes a lot if time in class and his notes are useless. Study the textbook. ,0
"Professor Donato is one of my favorite professors. You will definitely have to work hard for your grade if you take him, but you will learn a lot. I would recommend that everyone take a class with professor Donato if they are able.",1
"Dr. Knight is one of the nicest professors on CSU campus. He cares so much for his students and is very understanding of the student's morale as the semester goes on. You need to study for his tests, but as long as you pay attention in class (which isn't very hard; they're so interesting), you're going to be okay. A true bona fide cowboy for sure.",1
"I took Schultz for a ""D"" semester. By the 6th week of a 8 week course, she has only graded one paper out of 5. Also, she has knocked one week off the course making it 7 weeks (The final was due on the 12/6 and now is due 11/30). All of this would be fine if she gave more feed back, since she does not though, knowing your grade is a guessing game.",0
Attendance is a must since he grades it. Not a harsh grader and a very nice guy. Tests weren't too difficult since it was made by the students.,1
"Guelph has a lot of racists who will hate on Fei Song just because he is Chinese and has an accent. However, he is perfectly understandable, extremely helpful and wicked smart. He always replies to emails fast, and stays after class to answer any questions. He may not be the best lecturer though,  since he sticks to his slides pretty rigidly.",1
"Great guy, lectures alot but it's not to bad at all. If you study and show up it shouldnt be a problem, he's also got some great stories and i found him very engaging.",1
"Professor Cassidy is hands down one of my least favorite professors. I had her for PHIL321 and I hated the class. She gives out so much homework and is a very strict grader. Its a Gen Ed class and Ive never had so much homework in my life. She takes this class way too seriously. But besides that, shes a nice ish person.",0
"Very unclear on expectations and takes forever to grade things. By the time she tells you that you did something incorrectly, you've already turned 2 other assignments in. Acts in person like she is laid back and an easy going instructor but she's not. She's very picky and will pick you apart.",0
"TOM IS AWESOME.  If there is one prof. to ever have teach you at GVSU, let it be him.  Down to Earth, entertaining, outgoing and passionate about keeping his students interested.  I loved him.",1
"Adam Meyer is a very laid back professor. He is kind of awkward and shy, but later in the semester he opened up more.",1
HA!  I hope someone shoots me in the face instead of letting me take her class again.,0
"Prof. Cote-Robbins is a top notch instructor who really knows her subject, Native Amer. Contact Lit. She is also incredibly responsive and supportive to her students. A+",1
"Professor Nguyen is a very caring teacher! He really challenges his students and wants to see them succeed. Overall, philosophy is a very difficult subject but that's what you know signing up. I hate reading but you have to read because everything on the tests comes from the book and his extra notes. He's also funny which makes the class enjoyable.",1
"I am absolutely astonished that this class is still required. This class is based on pointless memorization of exact phrases, SAM projects that feel like grade school, and long drawn out lectures. RUN, RUN from this class and this professor.",0
"The midterm and final were comprised of exactly the same questions that were on the reviews, so if you study those well, you'll ace the tests. It's a difficult class that requires outside research if you want to make an A.",0
"Not a very good lecturer. Not always very helpfull one on one either. Often answers ""I don't know"" to questions about the assignments, without any promise to get back to you.",0
"This professor was the worst one I have ever had. Her modules are several pages long and are extremely irrelevant in terms of weighing it next to the textbook. You are graded on three things only (one midterm, one assignment, one final) and it takes FOREVER to receive your mark (still waiting on the final). Unclear instructions, limited feedback.",0
"He definitely cares about his students and is VERY excited about math, but my group and I have attended every lecture and still have no clue what we are doing! He gives unclear instructions and tells you that you are right when you are wrong. Unless you're a math whiz, find a more accessible teacher!",1
Nerdy and difficult to understand. Very strange,0
didnt have him for a class but met with him to take econ course at community college where i am absolutely positive 3 or 4 people with my major did and he claimed he never let them and so he didnt let me. wouldnt hear me out. was rude. not helpful at all.,0
Professor Byars is awesome!! She lectures out of the book and doesn't use powerpoints so be prepared to take notes. She has a great sense of humor and keeps class fun. Tests are easy and she gives a study guide which will have everything on the test. Class isn't challenging but it's a 100 level. Definitely recommend taking her!,1
Philosophy of law. Fascinating and super friendly. To get good grades on his essays just express ur opinion!,1
I had to retake Math 120 and I chose Professor Sutton and it was a great choice! Let's you use as many notes on Quizzes and Tests. You can buy the book to do Homework but I never used it. No Calculator but in reality you can't use a Calculator in a Math 120 class anyways. Does group and individual quizzes too.,1
"We have 7 non-cumulative exams, including the final being non-cumulative. We also had 5 papers due, which are an easy 10 points each. Each exam is over 2 chapters, so its not too hard to learn and study for. Exams are 40 questions all MC. I would definitely take him for PSY 364.",1
"Worse teacher I ever had. Like seriously, I really had to drop this class. A lot of people was unaware of these quizzes that we were suppose to be taking because she wasn't announcing whenever we had one , so a lot of people received zeros for them because she didn't let us make them up. Even though her tests are open book they are still not easy.",0
Don't ever take this class!! rough and boring,0
"Loved Franulic as a prof, her class was easy as long as you either knew Spanish decently or payed attention in class. Lots of online homework but you learn how to breeze through it. Not the most helpful in class with questions and also semi disorganized, but she genuinely cares that you learn, and on top of that is very kind and funny.",1
"He is very smart but teaches the class like it's a 300 level instead of 100. The class moves very fast and has at minimum 100 slides a day. There was a lot of information given quickly. Online, non-graded quizzes help to prepare for tests. Clicker questions every day also help. Learning modules are hard but interesting. Grades are straightforward.",1
Easily one of the worst prof Ive had. Skims through material without explaining it all or giving anyone a chance to write it all down. Calls kids out in class for saying as much as a word. Cant seem to lecture unless the entire 200 person lecture hall is silent,0
"I honestly loved this class. Pust knows and enjoys what he teaches. The class isn't the easiest A you'll ever get, but it's far from difficult. Definitely attend lectures, the notes are crucial and he doesn't post them. Study a night or two before the exam, know how to write an argument for or against the concepts, and you'll be totally fine.",1
An excellent class -- highly recommend it to those who like poetry,1
"To be honest, I really don't think this is that bad of a class but the work load is intense. What makes it worse is he expects a lot on the papers so the class average is always around a B. We get a lot of projects to do and around five quizzes. If you do the work and try, you'll get a B. I think there's 1 or 2 in the class with an A-",0
I really wanted to enjoy this class. Phelps is very opinionated and constantly contradicts what's in the book and DVDs. He is overly critical of the ONE PAGE writing assignments and is known to berade the class before passing out the graded essays. Very disappointed,0
"Professor is amazing. Show up to class for attendance, weekly assignments online, midterm and final and your done. Very good at catching attention and explaining political topics that are happening at the time. Would take again.",1
"Dr. Lim was not the best professor for this class. Avoid him like the plague if you can. I got a 67% on the final and that was the average. There was no curve in the class whatsoever, the only reason I passed was because the TA was amazing and gave a lot of partial credit. Multiple people cried during his final.",0
his accent made it hard for students to understand.,1
Leftists will love him. He only sees his side of things and grades accordingly. Will never take his classes again.,0
"She openly admits to not being good at lecturing and it shows quickly. She clearly has experience but she can't form the sentences to properly share her knowledge. Nice woman, kind of funny, but it does not make up for her flaws. We had one big group project that was near impossible. Tests suck too. Quit now.",0
"Dr. Vokey, as intelligent as he may be, is not good as an educator. He doesn't answer questions, tells you class is practically useless, and doesn't respond to emails. The only good thing about this class is the take home exams. Would recommend Dr. Allen for Psychology 2030",0
Tried so hard to study and still failed every test. Very hard to pay attention to the lectures. ,0
Can someone donate the old genetics tests to me?!? I am about to take this class this summer and I do not know anyone who has taken him at UTM so far,1
Barry Cooper is a twisted individual masquerading as a professor. The man has clearly never listened to a single lecture concerning the connection of greenhouse gasses and climate change. He should have been booted out of the University a long time ago if they have any respect for scientific practice.,0
"Challenging class, but well planned out and taught. Try and you'll do well.",1
"Professor thinks he's helpful, but he's confusing. The tests are extremely difficult and you don't have enough time to finish. Recommend taking the class elsewhere if it's required.",0
"The class wasn't as interesting as I'd hope (Oceanography). Majority of students zone out in class. 4 HW assignments, go to Discussion to get help, seriously. One redemptive HW, do it. iClicker points each class. One midterm, one final, not cumulative. Studied the night before and got a B on both. I'm sure if I tried harder, I would've gotten an A.",1
did not teach necessary stuff for 204; b/c Stan uses Reed's horrendous book!!!,0
Extremely condescending,0
"What a great teacher! Dr. Fulgham truely cares about his students and is very easy to understand.  We go over the music everyday, so when it's time for the test, everyone knows their stuff. Awesome class and teacher!!",1
"Extremely nitpicky, tough grader, and no partial credit. Demanding. Abrasive. Arrogant. Intense. Nearly shouts the lecture most days; talks down to the class. Most unpleasant class I've had BY FAR. I'd looked forward to taking Acc508 Controllership ever since premajor, but I learned only he teaches it. Now I'd rather take five more tax classes",0
TAKE HER! chem 112 is not that easy but she tries to help you succeed. she gives you multiple chances for bonus points and she is very helpful. her tests are pretty fair not necessairly easy. she is a great teacher. take her you wont regret it. she actually cares about the success of her students,1
"Dr. Hanks is fantastic. The material is really interesting and you learn a lotn abhout the Maya, but he also slips in complex theories like Foucalt and you dont even know. The tests are easy and you can do well from class notes and a little extra research as long as you understand the material. It is the perfect sociocultural for an archaeologist.",1
"This professor is a very hard grader, points are taken off tests because of not writing parenthesis, or an equal sign. He is very disrespectful, the very first day of school he told us he was only trying to help and that we could look at him as our favorite grandpa, three weeks later he refused to answer questions. PLEASE DON'T TAKE HIM!!",0
"He uses the phrase ""social justice"" when talking about poor people.  I wish some people wouldn't offend the rest of us with Communist-indoctrination vocabulary.",1
"By far the best math professor I've ever had. Her lectures are very clear and she explains things in a way everyone can understand. She is caring and wants her students to succeed and really understand the material. She is available for help out of class, provides test reviews beforehand, tests are straighforward. Absolutely recommend her to anyone",1
bailyn is my guy,1
Great professor. I highly recommend him for any class he teaches,1
"I personally did not enjoy this class in the online format. I feel as though I didn't learn much by reading written lectures, and this made the essays difficult to write. I wish there were more opportunities for points other than just the essays. I'm sure Shindo is a great professor in person, but overall, I didn't gain much this semester.",0
"realistically I went to one class and didn't even bother going to the others. Just read the textbook, he's not saying anything special. LOOK FOR PAST PAPERS. Some stuff on the midterm was directly from some past papers I found. His questions are weirdly worded and confusing too so the past papers were really helpful.",0
I cannot believe how RUDE this professor was. You cannot ask a simple question without getting sassed and a half-assed answer. There were 33 assignments (3/week) and 3 major tests. It was harder to manage than any class ive taken before.,0
"Everyone is right. He does not teach at all, just meaningless lectures in which he does proofs all class. No need to show up to any classes because you have to teach yourself everything. He has retests in which are all different than the HW, so you have to take them over and over until you have a 80. WORST teacher and thank god for retests...",0
"EXCELLENT teacher. He knows his material, and is always pure and good to all his students. I admire all his beliefs and practices. He is a healthy man, and inspiring to all students. I would definelty recommend taking one of his classes, as you will find out for yourself how great of a person he is. There is not many people like him, and I love him",1
She is extremely opinionated!!! She is rude if she does not like you or your art. Student's attendance is mandatory but she was ALWAYS late. Easy A if you do the work though.,0
"Won't be taking again. She's super nice but is really unclear on how she wants assignments done (terrible rubrics) and is a very tough grader. I liked the way she explained things, but on tests, quizzes, papers, and the online project, she is extremely particular on the wording you choose. Don't buy the writer handbook, only the others.",1
"I absolutely loved this class, Steve really worked to make the material interesting and relevant to social issues, when it easily could have been just a ""monster story"" class. Really nice and funny which made it easy to talk to him and discuss essay ideas. With more confidence he will be an outstanding professor.",1
"Attendance is a grade! There is only 2 grades in the class, a midterm and a final. All of it is focused on ancient civilization and then the midterm and final is a timed writing exam. If you skip a class you get 3 points off your final. It is entirely lecture, no technology is allowed or you gets points off. The lecture is crazy long, bring coffee!",0
"On the first week, she slams her hand on a table to make sure we are listening. It's difficult to convince her on the exams you ""own the material"". There's also an essay due the day of the multiple choice final.",1
"Drags on in lecture, doesn't really deliver the content in an interesting way. The class is textbook heavy, you have to do the readings to do well. With that said, it's not a difficult course if you do the readings.",1
"Professor Zhang was awful. His accent is IMPOSSIBLE to understand. He is way too smart to teach the material well. I got an 88 on the first test, and it all went downhill when the material got harder. I failed this class miserably and re-took it with professor Stephen Wuor and passed with a B! He was the best professor I have ever had!!!",0
"The most important thing is her exams are really difficult,You need to study hard for her exams.",0
"Dr. Costanza varies his lecture material and explanation based on his interests, but expects the student to write in-depth papers on each topic every week. Tough quizzes that are weighted to info or details NOT discussed in class. Costanza's rigid ultra-conservative Christianity can be uncomfortable. On plus side, class is repetitive tasks and easy",0
HE ALSO TESTS YOU ON HIS STUPID SYLLABUS....MEANING HIMSELF!  HELLE TALK YOU RIGHT TO SLEEP!  ONE OF THE MOST BORING PROFESSORS AT CSI!  HIS TESTS ARE DREADFULLY LONG FOR NO REASON...HIS EXAM WAS EVEN LONGER AND HARDER!,0
She is a very tough teacher. You can learn a lot if you dedicate the time to her courses. She expects you to come prepared to class. If you aren't she will scold you. Find another teacher for this class if possible.,0
"I'm not sure if I can speak for everyone else, but Terry made econ MUCH, much more difficult than it needed to be. If you need help, get it, because he expects you to know everything inside out ten times through.",0
"Professor Gibson means well, but is disorganized. It's not a straight forward so focus. ",0
"The class is designed to use the next generation science standard format to model what science teachers need to use in their field. The book was used to supplement what Steve taught and in some chapters, helped clear up lectures, but was mostly not needed. Show up and participate and you'll be fine. He is very picky on lesson plan. Steve is great.",1
"Brian is awesome! He really makes you feel comfortable in the class, so your never have a problem asking him about anything. Great guy who really knows his stuff.",1
"He was a funny guy and kept things interesting.  He puts his notes online so you can follow them during lecture.  That being said, going to lecture is a good idea because sometimes he veers from his written notes.  I liked him.",1
"VERY unprepared - shows up a little late but the powerpoint he just reads off then has you do the example. The answer to it is not available online. Tells you to put everything in calculator in 1 go and wouldn't go over your work really. Homeworks are LONG, if you don't know how to use R, he don't either. Doesn't put in grades timely at all.",0
"Worst online professor I've ever had. You're just going to read the textbook, that's it. There is absolutely no instruction from him whatsoever. He posts power point slides for each of the chapters, but there is no review of the course material. He simply relies on Revel. He won't even post grades in Canvas, you have to go to Revel for that.",0
Took this class over the summer. Hardest class I have ever taken and I hated this class. You have to do three post every wee and write a paper. Midterm and final paper that ended up being over ten pages long by the time  I was finished answering all the question that he asked. If you do one answer all the question that he ask he will make you down.,0
"8 weeks are usually loaded with tons of work but this one is pretty easy. 4 essays, no midterm or final. Lectures are boring but make it enjoyable for 3hrs. I would highly recommend taking her if you want an easy class in English.",1
"What is expected is very clear in the syllabus. You know quiz and test dates ahead of time. This is the second professor I have had for 1950. If you have a choice between Hadavas and Brawner TAKE HADAVAS!  He is very helpful, and if you visit office ours he will make sure you understand. Very approachable too!",1
"Terri is very nice and is always willing to help her students succeed. She is very personable and extends a hand whenever you need help. Her class was manageable. I would suggest reading the power points in depth as they help you prepare for exams. In labs, you have stations and it can be difficult to get your work done so plan your time properly.",1
One of the worst economics professors i have come across.,0
I found this class unrealistic for an online course. So many projects. These last two discussion board questions  were turned into assignments that would be considered full blown big assignment projects by any other teacher. Too little points for so much work. I did not feel like I learned that much from this class. ,0
"Prof. Moiles is such a nice guy and is very clearly passionate about what he is teaching. I just found his lectures to be a little boring and though the material is no harder than H.S. government, I didn't do good on the written parts of his tests because he is a pretty tough grader. He also takes a long time to grade papers.",0
"The class itself isn't too bad; a couple assignments are a lot of work but it's mainly group work or reading quizzes. The problem is Branch's organization. He never answers student questions on time or posts quizzes when he's supposed to, which makes an online course very confusing. Also, he goes way off topic during lectures.",0
"I was excited to take a Philosophy class and am super glad I took it with him as a Professor. I found the lectures very interesting because we didn't just read from the book, he connected it to real life and made very interesting points. His tests are straight forward and as long as you listen in class they were easy! Would definitely recommend!",1
"Good guy, interesting class. You do a simple paper that amounts to a couple page summary of an article from a list of articles and an easy presentation. Tells you exactly what is going to be on tests and outlines expectations very clearly.",1
"Extra credit saved my grade. Only graded on tests, no cushion. Definitely go to class. Read the textbook",0
"Easy to understand, conveys a lot of scientific information",1
"Professor Richmond is so sweet and a very genuine person who only wants the best for her students. Attendance wasn't mandatory and every quiz/exam was on Blackboard. Don't purchase the textbook, its not worth paying for as her power points sum up each chapter very well.",1
"Horrible professor! Do not take classes with this professor.  She is an unfair grader and not an easy teacher to get along with.  I agree with the other commenter that she is definitely gender biased, and I'm a girl! Take at your own risk.",0
MacMillan teaches the ribozyme section and refuses to put any effort into his notes or lecture plans. His lectures are all over the place and he often misspeaks and does not correct himself. Comparing MacMillans lecture quality to the other excellent profs in this course (Dr. Mok / Dr. Shultz) is embarrassing. Worst prof I've had in my IMIN deg.,0
"He talks way to much during the lecture on something that can be easily summed up but he means well, there's quizzes almost every Monday and he gives a lot of homework, and he gives some assignments that are totally useless but still impact your grade. The quizzes are not difficult to pass though.",1
"ECE 241 is an intro class for Computer Engineering.  Meaning that nobody knows anything about computers in general.  From the first day, Dwight spoke to us as if we already knew everything we needed to know about Computer Engineering.  That put us in mass confusion.  Not to mention that the labs took three weeks to grade.",0
"Dr. Tonks is a well respected chemist in the state of SC and would be a very cool guy to work for. That being said, he will come to class every day and SHOW you everything you need to know; but you will have to go home and TEACH it to yourself.",0
"Seems like a nice person but he takes an archaic approach to everything. Teaches in such an outdated way that he is basically doing more harm than good. His lectures could be boiled down to 1/5 the time, his resume expectations are straight outta 1985, he doesn't understand current majors and will expect you to present on bizarre topics. Avoid him.",0
I really like Dr. Kelley as a person! She's super friendly! Her lectures cover basically everything u learned in the textbook so they're not essential but I liked to go for participation credit. I didn't always feel like the labs accurately reflected what we learned in class & via textbook though. Also the exams are NOT curved.,1
"The WORST professor in McGill.. There's no other word to describe him but ""HORRIBLE!"" The course is ridiculously difficult. All you need to do is just memorize the entire course material.. He is also very arrogant. Good luck..",0
A horrible time for all involved as groans and long faces were common.  Oscillates between dull and cringe-inducing.,0
"Do not take Mr. Weiner's class. Do not. He doesn't answer questions, there are a lot of assignments. He is stubborn in his opinion. He can be very rude. The class is like a high-level sociology class instead of an intro class. There is so much reading and if you don't understand it he patronizes you. Just find some other professor, please.",0
Great class.  My mixes are so much better.  Just do the work and pay attention to the details.  He goes off on the little mistakes so you don't make them when it matters.,1
"Professor Stevens is the best professor for 191, but he might not be the easiest A. He is an amazing teacher, he tells you exactly what to read and concepts to attempt before class. You have to be a consistent student, but he makes it easier by adding extensions to tests and drops your lowest 5 quizzes. He genuinely wants you to learn.",1
"The best teacher at Northwest, by far.  Not because he's easy, but because he makes sure you learn what you're supposed to learn in the class.  Very helpful, extremely nice guy.  Highly recommended.",1
he's extremely enthusiastic and makes the class a lot fun.  the lectures are really interesting.  I'm glad that i took this class.,1
Boring teacher who refers very little to text book. His quizzes and exams are tough but the quizzes match up fairly well with the exams so you'll be good if you study up on those. Not much direction on papers but they're really long. But he will help you thoroughly if you seek it and his quizzes have small twists in them so you should do fine.,0
"makes understanding of materials easier, gives lots of good examples",1
"He has been the most passionate, inspiring, &, genuine profesor I have ever had. Each day was memorable in class discussion having us use different perspectives to analyze literature. This class is no cake walk, but he truly shows you how much you are capable of and opens you up to Chicago&Illinois history which has an incredibly unique timeline!!!",1
"I have never had a worse professor in my life. If you are reading this don't even consider taking his course. He constantly threatens to fail the class if you don't do oddly specific things. Tells you not to email him, syllabus is confusing, grading is confusing, he is not only a bad professor but just seems to be an awful human being. Do not take.",0
Great Professor that really wants you to succeed. 3 tests and cumulative final. Material isn't easy. You must master and genuinely understand it to pass the tests. I highly recommend doing the optional book problems/connect practice before classes. HW is an easy A. Extra credit for going to finance club meetings. Grade on final replaces lowest test,1
Dr Li is SO VERY WONDERFUL! I think she is the best professor for learning research statistics. I took her for both HLM and SEM and LOVED it. She is so kind and funny and KNOWLEDGABLE. You simply cannot go wrong by taking her. Sign up today!!!,1
Dr. Adolino is a ruthless grader.  She has incredibly strict writing guidelines and takes off significant percentages of grades for minor errors. She has significantly higher standards than other professors at JMU.  While this is normally a good thing she immediately expects her students to be on her level.  If it is not to her standard it is wrong,0
"Ugh, NOT a good class, especially in the morning.  She talks WAY to fast and it's hard to seperate out what you need to know for the test and what you don't.  She also has these games before the tests that do not help at all.  VERY hard to understand, i wish I had never taken this class!",0
"If you ever consider taking a manageable Maymester class to fulfill your human diversity requirement, you should definitely take his class. His class is super easy and interesting as long as you put in about 80% of efforts into the coursework. Easiest class ever....",1
Jason Detrani is a really great professor.  He really  cares a lot about his students and wants them to succeed and makes a cinema class a lot of fun.  He ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
"The way he presents material is horrible and exam questions are 100% out to get you. I should have checked reviews beforehand, because I have never done so poorly in a class for my major and had to literally pull my grade from the trenches. I worked so hard before exams and would get 65-75% every time and be so discouraged... dont take this course",0
"Professor Pozzi is a weak teacher and does not understand her study body. Her teaching is not student based, and she makes no efforts to help her students succeed. Refrain from taking her at GVSU, if possible.",0
"It sounds like a certain student just needed a lot of hand holding and is angry it wasn't handed to her. If the program is so flawed, why are the majority of students doing excellent. Be an adult, take responsibility for your own failure, don't blame the program. Prof Waller has been nothing but helpful to me btw",1
"Lots of good information if you can stay awake for his lectures. Although, because his beefy sausage knuckles, his writing that's worse than a Parkinson's victim, and the fact he writes with his left hand means you might as well forget trying to copy anything useful down. Just wait for him to post his notes online.",1
She's very book smart.,0
Very very nice and helpful teacher. She helped me for hours just to fix a bug. And also excellent enthusiasm (never seen that from anyone else)! A must to take. Also lenient in marking and likes to give bonus mark!,1
"Preaches all semester about how ""accounting theory doesn't have an exact answer"", but then gives you 0 on a question because ""it didn't match the marking key"".   Good prof though, seems to know his stuff, but the exams (which are worth 80% of the course) seem to be up to random chance.",0
Ive never rated a professor before until now. Professor Wong is very disorganized and makes many mistakes during class. She makes many mistakes and the students always have to correct her when shes lecturing. She is also very rude and snarky to students when you dont understand the content. Also note she does not give extra credit. Absolute hell,0
"Professor cares only for literal policy translation, cannot be bothered between classes by any students, is ignorant and callous to student needs. California Issued Drivers Liscence is not enough to prove your identity to him, either student ID or you're treated as an imposter.",0
"Had him his first semester at BYU--he's replacing Dr. Toronto temporarily.  Extremely nice guy who really cares about getting the students to think and learn.  Class material was interesting, and we did more than just read and listen to lectures.  Tests were challenging but fair.",1
Dr. Spears is an excellent teacher - if you come to class and study your notes you'll do fine - but you gotta come to class! HIGHLY recommend the field trips - best time ever! He acts like a hard ass but he's really a softy if you get on his good side. Lab tests are difficult - gotta learn your rocks!,1
"Pretty good professor. You HAVE to read the textbook to do decently well on the exams, and even then it's really hard to get As. He curves them, but not a lot. Office hours are early in the morning and very quick and he's not that much help outside of class. Sort of blows you off. Overall not a bad class, but worked super hard for less of a reward.",1
Took his SOC 421 class offered one day a week. Super fun and interesting class. No assignments just a midterm and a final. You'll do well as long as you study for those tests.,1
Really knows her stuff. Very enjoyable class. Interesting readings and a great chance to sharpen your writing skills. Could not have been more helpful. Would not hesitate to take any class with Prof. Chandler.,1
"I'll start by saying, ""Oh my god. He is so boring."" He speaks in a deep monotone voice and even jokes about it in class occasionally. His lectures cover really deep material, but the homework covers the absolute basics. His tests barely change between years so if you can find a previous year test, you can easily pass using it as a study guide.",1
Amazing prof! Definitely recommend to take his course!,1
The course is heavily text influenced. Be prepared to read 5+ books before midterms. He doesnt teach about actual historical events but more on the authors and their opinions on history. He means well but he is an awful teacher,0
"Make sure you have a SCANNER & PRINTER. very confusing, doesn't respond to emails, gives a lot of hw, doesn't make sense sometimes, makes you print out tons of paper. Quizzes on MML can be hard and not have things we've learned so be aware if you have to take her. My suggestion, would NOT take her AT ALL. She is tied with being my WORST prof ever",0
Lots of reading and writing but its worth it. She gives so much feedback your forced to revise.,1
Go to his office hours. he will answer any of your questions there. he loves tea so bring him one and he will love you forever. he's a very nice person but tough class. write down everything he says. I recommend typing on your computer because that is faster,1
"Her exams are extremely difficult with no help from lectures. She's a tough grader and her assistants are even worse. she's VERY kind, very attractive, great personality etc but as a professor, she's a wolf in sheep's clothing. 100% AVOID.",0
"I wasn't a huge fan of Dr. Alexander. Lectures were very dull, but they were crucial for tests, which along with attendance make up your entire grade. Everybody is different, but I'd probably transfer schools if my only option was to take him again",0
"He makes you work hard for his class, but you learn a lot.",1
What a DORK !!!!!!,0
"He is one of the best professors I had this year. His lecture was easy to understand as long as you follow his stories. But the reason I'll take him again is that he can always help you on any type of question outside of the classroom like current events. Go talk to him, you will be amazed.",1
Requires 2 books and doesnt tell you until you need them like the next day and they're hard to find.,1
"She was nice, however, her lectures were very boring. The class was super easy, but I was bored the entire time. She had a few tests and also made you come into her office with a group in order to do a verbal test.",0
DO NOT take this class with Trefzger. This is one of the hardest classes I've ever taken. A lot of people dropped because it was so hard. His lectures are long and boring. If you bomb one test you have a zero chance at getting an A or B. Do yourself a favor and take this class with Cring.,0
"Good prof, really enjoyed her classes.",1
By far the worst professor I have ever had. He is not qualified to be teaching at all.,0
Best prof.,1
"Borg was harsh when you met him in office hours and unwilling to listen when you explained why you thought he was wrong. If you pay attention to his political views and write in accordance with them you'll do better, even if it's not what you think. Quizzes are hard. Ask him about your thesis before you write it. Midterm and final were graded harsh",0
"Dr. Vohs is great. He's a brilliant professor in my opinion. He's the best lecturer I've taken to date, he's clear and concise, he has good analogies to help students understand what he's teaching. He really dislikes swearing, so avoid swearing in front of him (I accidentally dropped a swear word and now he isn't particularly fond of me)",1
"The most wonderful, kind, experienced, delightful, intelligent, highly enthusiastic, warm and fuzzy professor in the entire computer science department. You will never regret having him as a professor",1
His tests are very difficult. Not because the material is hard but because he does not know how to word the tests. He is very confusing and become defensive when you try to get clarity. I would not recommend taking this class.,0
I would suggest that if you have to have a class and the offer another professor then take the class with the other professor. I would find myself emailing him for an assignment due in a couple of days and him not replying for weeks later. You learn absolutely nothing from him!,0
Dr Foster is great! He cares about his students and their success in college. He is very helpful if you are having any issues. I recommend him to anyone. I am just starting college and he alone has made me look forward to the rest of my time here. The material he taught will make my college carrer a success!! Thanks Dr. B!,1
"He is very hard to understand, condescending, and has a million questions per homework assignment (which are assigned every week). But he gives out study guides that basically tell you what the exam is going to be on which is the only reason I got a B",0
"Matt Rand  is an amazing professor. His lectures include powerpoints and a bevy of different things to entice students. He is always willing to answer even the most outlandish question. His major works deal with animals so expect connections, but they will be class orientated. I would love to take a class by him again.",1
"Young wakes up in the morning and wonders how shes gonna make her students hate their lives .. if you ask for help, well goodluck bc getting a clear answer is next to impossible with her. She intentionally makes everything on blackboard a pain to open and read. She prob got her doctorate just to be called dr. I would never ever recommend her!!!!!",0
"Leamy is very nice and helpful. She breaks things down so it's very easy to understand. Make sure you go to class because she gives EC at the end and I felt lost when I would miss a class. Do the WebWork, it matters. And watch the pre class videos because it's the only way to understand the quizzes.",1
"Member of the Democrat Party. If you are expecting a Government class you're in the wrong place. Nagle spends about half of the semester on Civil Rights requiring reading of such titles as ""Coming of Age in Mississippi"". While there is nothing wrong with that title, civil rights is another course. If you are a Conservative, avoid like the plague.. ",0
"He was one of the worst professors I've ever had. He never hands back any papers, quizzes, or homework in a timely manner. And he grades everything extremely hard. I'm an A student and i got a D in his class. He goes off into tangents that have nothing to do with anything and is very unclear in what he expects from you. Word to the wise...Get out w",0
He is gorgeous and caring. He is super smart and nice!!! I low key admire himï¿½ï¿½,1
"Melvin King never attended lectures. He depended on another professor to teach the lecture, and TA to teach the lab. However, he was the one making the quizzes and exams. Be prepared to read and to pay attention in lecture.",0
bad professor because He has no justice in bicycles giving a full or zero score. It is so bad that it is indescribable and I do not recommend that students take his class,0
avoid if possible! only perk to having her is there is no final. tests are all multiple choice which sounds good but they end up being impossible. class avg on exam 2 was a 60. bad accent. calls people out and makes them look like a fool if they're wrong. take another teacher,0
"AMAZING prof, my fav thus far at GMU. Take anything by him. He is extremely helpful and the class I took was very interesting. You learn tons of info, but more importantly grow an appreciation for that info. I took it as a freshman, non-art his major, just show up to classes (absolutely necessary), take notes, and you're golden.",1
"She has a unique way to teach math. She jumps some steps while showing the process in order to make students think and questions. It is her way to make students participate. If you ask her questions, she will analyze your questions carefully in order to help you clarify some foundation misunderstand. She sees math as a game.",1
She is a very strong lecturer and explains the concepts very well. The grading is all around fair and there is nothing unreasonable. The material on the midterm and final are covered well by the professor and the homeworks.,1
"Dr. Facknitz' poetry class was wonderful. At the time of taking the class, I was going through some pretty heavy stuff, which showed in the poems I submitted, and she treated me with dignity trhoughout. Also improved my writing a great deal. Show up and take the workshops seriously and you will love her. Thanks Dr. Facknitz.",1
Writes exam to decieve students instead of test knowledge.,0
"I don't think that Debessay is the worst person ever. He truly cares about wanting students to learn, but sometimes it comes off wrong. He can be condescending, suffocating, and a little snarky and off-putting, but he's a really sweet man, just not the best professor. Do the homework, do the test banks, participate, and you'll be fine.",0
He was an excellent professor and gave away lots of extra credit.,1
She is a tough teacher! Make sure you read ALL the chapters thoroughly because she asks a lot of questions from the book that she rarely goes over in class. Her lectures are very vague and she is not detail oriented in her powerpoints at all. You must be able to fend for yourself in this class. Be prepared for many all nighters.,0
Awesome class and awesome prof! Would definetly take another class with him.,1
"Great professor so far. She has a very laid-back, easy teaching method, and it works. She knows her stuff very well, and is very willing to help you figure something out, without giving you the answer straight out. She often looks over homework and quizzes when turned in and points out mistakes, giving you a chance to correct before it's graded.",1
"Probably the worst professor  I have had so far at Schulich (MBA). Clearly isn't well suited to teach the MBA curriculum, as all he knows are theories, but has difficulty relating back to relevant work scenarios. AVOID - take with Friendman.",0
"Definitely a bad teacher. Found out about this site too late, so had to take him. Unfriendly, not at all helpful; sends you to the TA. Lectures are unclear & hard to follow; tests & essays extremely hard. Be prepared for a lot of reading, some of it irrelevant and unnecessary. Avoid him if you can for this class; don't take Joyner for TA either.",0
"He is nice, I learned a lot in his classes.",1
"Very nice teacher, tough class. Study your vocabulary !!",1
It's her way or the highway.  Absolutely no personal input allowed.  Not good in art.,0
"Textbook is Useless, come to class and you'll be okay if you focus and put in the work. Oh and if you go out of the midterm thinking you got an A+, think again",1
"Over-simplified when teaching, giving instructions or providing information regarding tests, and then the test or presentation would arrive and he'd pull out all this criticism and criteria to be tested so beyond the scope of his teachings. Actually gave me a 0 on one of my answers on the midterm, had to show it to him and prove it was 100% correct",0
"I enjoyed having Mr. Vaughn as my instructor. He works out multiple problems on the board -will ask if anyone needs help understanding the problem before he moves on, and will go over a problem if needed. He does skip the small mental parts (this is college) but will gladly go through it if asked. Attend class, dont be afraid to ask for help.",1
"This professor is blatantly using her course to ""teach students a lesson"" about how hard college classes are. Her lectures are scattered and confusing. Several times she gave tests that were ""based on the study guide"" but contained no actual study guide material. She is condescending towards students in class when asked questions.",0
"Very informative, I still remember things she taught and that was 3 years ago.  Way to go Kate!I agree, slides do make you sleepy.",1
"He is THE MAN!  I have the biggest crush on him!  And hes the best teacher in the music school, maybe on the whole campus! or on the whole planet!",1
"Literally THE ONLY class I didnt get an A in my first semester!! Heinrich is a little intimidating and often runs off on a lot of tangents. You never completely finish a lesson and youre expected to read two 30+ page chapters every week. The online quizzes are easy, but they dont help much if you do not do well on the midterm and final. WORST",0
"Since it's an art class, all of the grades are subjective, which makes it really difficult. If you put in a lot of effort and learn what he looks for, you should do pretty well. He does swear and make a lot of jokes, so if you are easily offended, this might not be the class for you.",1
"Hardly uses the book. If you show up to class and take notes, you'll have everything you need. Didn't really care for the only test format and it's multiple choice. He likes to try and trick you with words on the test. Curves the test average to a 72 or 73. If the average is higher, no curve.",1
She was unhelpful and confusing. Her grading was nit picky. Her review of the papers of how you got the grade made no sense at all. AVOID THIS CLASS. She does not work with you and is very rude. Talks down to you alot. Not flexible at all. I could go on and on but just dont take her class!,0
Good professor. Straightforward. Interesting topics. Gives good study guides. You have to go to class to get notes that aren't in the book. The book was helpful to combine info for study guides.,1
Nancy is one of the most mono tone prof. I've ever had she can really TALK and it is really hard to pass her test she makes so you have to remember the book and everything she says then she makes you do a portfolio that is not that bad but still kind of time consuming. point is I never want to take her again!,0
Great professor! She really takes the time in class to explain and make sure her students understand the material. There is homework from the textbook which is for practice and taken for a completion grade. Homework usually does not take more than 30 minutes.,1
"This is what you expect from a professor teaching an introduction class. Professional, requires some brain power, really interesting, though not presented in the best manor. And if you go meet him in his office, he's nice, and helpful. The exams are only slightly challenging. Explains it so even someone with no experiences can understand.",1
"Hard, unorganized.",0
Marek would be easier to comprehend if he stopped taking English lessons from E.T.,0
I took ist101 with professor Rohm and it was an easy class. He is a business man who knows how the world really functions. He might not be the best professor to teach the subject but you can learn a lot from him if you pay close attention to him. It was an easy A for me even though I skipped a lot of classes.,1
Great prof. Funny. Easy going. Smart. Good in-class arguments and participation. One of the best profs. in Philosophy. Would have him again,1
"He's awesomely funny.  I love Dr. B.  Take him for any history class you can.  The lectures are interesting, tests are fair.  You can't miss with this guy",1
Dr. Wessinger was an amazing professor! There was SO much information to cover in this course and it was really tough to learn everything but it was all so interesting that it came pretty naturally for me and most of the other students.,1
Her exams are a mess. Some questions I swear is from her nursing practitioner background and nothing to do with the course. Brags about herself,0
"shes so moody and shes the worst teacher ever, her grading is uncomprehensible!",0
"Discussions weren't relivant to readings half the time, partly the students falt. Don't expect feed back on papers either. He's funny though and nice, but I think he'd rather be in France then here.",0
You cannot miss a class or you won't know what happened. he goes off topic and can be really harsh. if you  have problems with the test ir are a nervous test taker he help you which is nice.,0
"He sometimes responds to emails, I have one that's sitting 6 days not responded to at the moment. He missed two of our classes in a row with no forewarning. His lectures were very awkward, and not useful to the class. There was a required text book but it was online and free; Reading it is necessary for the Midterm and Final, but not the lectures.",0
"Bad professor, and he do not know what he needs, and you can not take any outside sources because he considered it as zero.",0
"Yes, this teacher was very funny. But he was more concerned with quickly cramming   information than going over problems to help the class understand. Answering questions was either hit or miss depending on the amount of topic he had left to cover that day. Maybe not the teaching style that works best for me but I didn't feel like I learned a thing",0
NEVER TAKE HER CLASS. NEVER. It was the most stressful class in my life.,0
"Not the best professor I've had, but she was good! She uses an old overhead projector with transparencies for notes and is willing stay after class to further explain something. She's really nice too!",1
"All these comments explain exactly what she is. She's great and I've never had a professor that cared so much. My grade might not be good, but it's my fault. All i know is that it's so easy & enjoyable. I love her class and love her way of teaching.",1
"Only two options for this particular semester were to take the class at either 7:30am or 9am. She's very chipper and ready to teach, but classes aren't that interesting.",1
"He knows his stuff, but he goes off on tangents that only make thing more confusing for the student, and his power points have very little information to work from.  If you do not take notes in class, you're doomed.",0
"hardly had class on fridays, which would be a good thing if she actually lectured the other days of class. unclear of what to expect to on the final. Unclear about everything",0
Dr. Drew is one of a kind. He definitely gets distracted and off topic quite a bit but it makes class fun.  I sometimes felt like going to class was a waste of my time but I did learn quite a bit about media and society.  If you want a blow off class take this.,1
"I love Gershuni, by far the best professor I have ever had. She is very proper and does NOT tolerate any type of talking or disruption during class. Participation is huge in her class and requires you to sign in for attendance. Her assignments make you think a lot, but you learn a lot and do a lot of critical thinking.",1
"He gives 300 question study guides for a 50 question test and you basically have to memorize every single question. Three exams and one final note test. The class is structured very weird, lectures and then go home and teach yourself the material from the textbook. I should have dropped this class when I had a chance.",0
"Dr. Chen is a REALLY bad lecturer, but at least his class is really easy. Tests and quizzes were not too complex. Go to recitation/studios, do some studying on your own (watch Sebastain Fernandez' Diffeq videos on YouTube) and you'll be straight.",1
"Toughest professor I have had and GVSU. She doesn't care about helping students succeed in her class and definitely has favorites. If you don't read and don't look into your readings (as far as finding themes, symbols, etc) theres no way you're going to pass the class.",0
"Pros: Knows the content, Good at giving lectures, Replies to emails promptly. Cons: NO STUDY GUIDES! NO FEEDBACK ON EXAMS! (i.e. missed questions), 20%+ Fill-in-the-blank on all exams (Better know how to spell all your enzymes!). It is just cruel expecting a student to be able to do well in a medical-based class with those 3 cons combined.",0
I couldn't imagine a more self-congratulatory professor. How could you screw up craft of fiction? Use it as your podium/back-slap/let me tell you about me and the writing process therapy session.,0
"DON'T TAKE HIS CLASS!!! Course assessments did not test our understanding of concepts, instead, we needed to memorize the smallest and most insignificant of details (ie, graphs he showed literally once). In other courses I got low 90s, in this class I got 60s on assessments despite hours and hours of studying. VERY textbook heavy. Good luck.",0
"Dr. Fossett is a great professor. If you struggle with chemistry, like I do, I really suggest you take his class. He's very patient and great at explaining things!",1
"Pennings is a nice guy in general. But not helpful at all. His favorite lines this semester were ""Not even close"" and ""If you don't know this, you will fail this course""... to me this isn't very encouraging. He also has one and only one way of doing things. He is always right and you are always wrong. He will make you feel bad about yourself.",0
If yoy take her class. You better lean on my math lab and be good at teaching yourself because she does not lecture and not good lectures when she does.,0
"You either really like him or really can't stand him.  Come to class, read and don't don't have thin skin.  His exams are straight to the point.  Either you know the material or you don't.",0
easy prof. esp. for this class take during may minimester,1
I took Kuefler for Fall of the Roman Empire and this was my biggest mistake at SDSU. Kuefler is incredibly boring and has an odd pitch that goes up and down as he speaks. He's incredibly inconsistent on the use of laptops and told me to put mine away while allowing other students to have their's. There's a fifteen page paper at the end. Do not take,0
"Professor seems unapproachable at times. Always seems too busy for students and is sarcastic a lot of the time. She grades attendance on a letter scale, so if you miss ONE class, you get an F for the day. It screws you over. So don't even think about skipping! Tests are hard too. No extra credit.",0
"I found Beverly Shannon frustrating at times. Throughout the semester she was vague about her expectations. For anyone taking EN 100, prepare to go to the labs after every writing project throughout the semester. I also find that she doesn't use her time in class very efficiently. She often went off on a rant that had nothing to do with the topic.",0
"As long as you stay on top of weekly assignments and read the textbook this class is easy. Prompts for assignments are clear and if you need to contact the professor she always responds quickly. 10 discussions, 6 papers, and 6 quizzes.",1
"There are 0 lectures posted, tons of trivial comments involved and really no lessons from the professor himself. You're teaching yourself, meanwhile he's constantly sending threats out about cheating every week and taking points off for nothing.",0
"The manner of teaching brings a new perspective to the classroom, but if you do not figure out his style with papers, you are in trouble. I requires a lot of thinking and keeps to the main themes. Overall, what I learned was limited, even though I use to like European History. Also, a tough grader.",0
"He is the worst professor I have ever had. Told me to drop the class because I was struggling, rather than try to help. His midterm had material he didn't go over, and he grades HARD, like 10 points for not putting an answer in correct form hard. Do yourself a favor, and stay away from this guy.",0
Tougher class very interesting work and content but his expectation are often unclear,1
"be careful of her bite, but don't let it intimidate you.",0
"Paul thinks he's the best prof at UofL. However, the truth is something different. This man couldn't philosophize his way out of a wet paper bag. By his own description he is an atheist, so I'm not sure why anyone would take a Phil of Religion class with him. Big surprise that this vindictive man wrote a paper on ""A Defense of Terrorism"".",0
Ok if you don't come to class your double done he is super harsh and can come off as an a hole but once you get what he wants his class is attainable he grades very harsh and is BIG on correct MLA and citation,0
Professor vavova is a really good philosophy professor. She hears your voice in the discussion and inspires you all the time. Outside class she is willing to make time to discuss philosophical ideas with you. You can always find time to talk to her about your papers or class readings. She grades tough though but you can learn a lot in her course.,1
Very poor teacher. Expects you to know the material before the semester begins. Won't help you in or outside of class to understand what the material covers. Has a holier than thou attitude towards his students. AVOID.,0
HORRIBLE TEACHER!!!!,0
"Ummm. He is a really nice guy, but not a good teacher at all. He never writes anything down or explains anything to you. He reads the book in class and expects you to attain information just by reading. Never responds to emails, and he lost my homework (he eventually found it but it was still frustrating). All in all: good person, bad teacher.",0
"Good lecturer. Very engaging. There is a lot of reading but most of it is interesting and fun to read!   Only downside, I found his jokes to be disrespectful at times. ",1
Wow this guy is bad. Your quizzed at the beginning of every single class about things you had to teach yourself. Then you have to sit there for a lecture filled with tangents and that is never relevant to what you read. 2 people in my class have above a B. 9 have below a C. Find someone else.,0
"Dr. Harris is not the best professor I've ever had or the most accommodating, but some of these reviews are a bit harsh. He did chase a kid for leaving class early and came back out of breath. It was funny though. His lectures can be hard to follow but they have a lot of detail. He's actually a nice guy. Ask questions after class. Don't interrupt.",1
She is really sweet but very very scatter brained and doesn't always know what is going on. Fairly easy grader though and you don't have any tests. Mostly it is write-ups answering a few questions and two group projects. It can be super confusing because she jumps from topic to topic all the time. ,0
This class is essentially a memory based class. You don't have to really show up to class but he gives extra credit quizzes at the end of most classes. He is not a bad professor but is not great . As long as you read the book you should pass his super easy tests. Plus his class has an online lab that gives you practice test for extra credit.,1
"Tough professor, but extremely knowledgeable. He knows where you will make mistakes and emphasizes on those areas to help students. Took him twice, didn't get a satisfactory grade the first time around. I now know this stuff like the back of my hand.",1
"Very unhelpful outside of class. I went with a question that should have taken no more than a few sentences to answer, left ten minutes late feeling more confused. He tends to go on long tangents when asked to explain anything and by the time he's done both of you have forgotten the original question. Kind of slow giving grades. Lecture heavy class",0
"Dr. Galileo was VERY monotone, and I was not interested or engaged. He reads off his powerpoint slides, and expects you to read the book to learn. He is not helpful, and does not answer emails . People say its an easy A (if you actually read the book and practice test), but I 100% preferred BISC401 which other people have said is harder. ",0
This professor is a mind blowing man and will have you look at a lot of things differently. This class is something that would have you think about how things should really be. A real brain teaser. This class is completely enjoyable.,1
SUCKS....................SUCKS.........KEEP AWAY!!!!!!!!!!....................I ask Questions he doesn't give answers and if he does they are so unclear...rather jump from the highest building campus (smith probably) than take his class again. Agree with all his opinions or be prapared to get a bad grade. I did not agree with his opinions.,0
This guy is rude. I think someone must let his smart head known that he lives in a civilized country and he is not a king.,0
"She was a great teacher, really made it easy to pass the course if you payed attention. Would def take another class with her.",1
"Horrible Horrible Horrible teacher.. When I say horrible, I mean the worst professor you will ever have. However, he's also the easiest grader I have ever come across. Gives a study guide prior to the exams, and switches up the numbers. I had no idea what was going on but somehow managed to get a B with minimum effort",0
"a genius at thermo, not as good at fluids though. He will be one of the hardest professors you'll ever have. Quite a funny guy and pretty chill. You can literally text him about homework problems. Its very likely to mess up at least one of his midterms in the course. But he curves a lot, so an A is not impossible if you review all the homework",1
"To be honest, I don't know if he was a good professor or not.  I never showed up to class because everything was online, including the final exam.  I aced all of the assignments, quizzes, and final exam just with my previous knowledge of what it means to recycle. Super easy class and easiest A I've ever received. Would recommend for an easy grade.",1
He made our calc2 class too easy cuz there was almost no homework and just easy weekly quizzes instead of tests. I'm pretty sure I bombed the department final bad. I'm screwed now in Calc 3.,1
"He has to be one of the worst teachers in New York state. He sent us slides that I could have put together in 8th grade and his videos were always off topic rants. He could never be clear with his assignments and when he wanted them done, but he made sure we knew every detail about his other class and that we should take it. 100% joke of a teacher.",0
"Excellent professor. Only class where I can pay attention straight for an hour and stay interested. He makes history come to life. Respectful of different opinions in discussion, assessment was straightforward: participation in discussion, midterm, final paper, exam. Would definitely take another class with him. ",1
Attendance is not required but go anyway since it makes the quizzes easier even if half are dropped. Study all the essay topics because she is random in favoring one topic over another. Lectures are dry but she cares and wants to help,1
"Come to class, prepare to listen to what she has to say for the whole time and you'll be set to go. Papers are realy easy if you are on time. Only complaint is that she is a little inconsistant when it comes to being on time for a private meeting between yourself and her.",1
"Dr. Adolino is extremely helpful in office hours, however the multiple choice on her exams can be extremely confusing and she is very unclear about reading assignments, often only saying ""be sure to have this book read by next class"" without any prior warning. Lectures are long and often a bit dry. Great person, not a good class.",1
"Really great prof - Interesting lectures, great sense of humour, super understanding about tests/grades/attendance.",1
I've never been a fan of the sciences.  This class put me to sleep.,0
"As a marketing major I was excited to take this course but after taking it with Daniel, I'm just glad its over. He is very smart and helpful if you go talk to him, but his classes are pointless to attend. The exams are very hard and he is a hard grader of the labs. ",1
"Professor Nuneville is very experienced in the law community, and she brings in several great guest speakers. Shes funny, smart and eager to help with anything you need. She also gives out free answers to the exams. A+.",1
She is great. Make sure you buy the textbook and not just the online access code. She wants everyone to leave that class knowing at least a little Spanish. She is extremely helpful and will work to get you a decent grade. Do the online lab! It will save your grade.,1
"You can tell he HAS to be there;not very passionate. However, he makes the class laugh every once in a while. I'd say he gives ""tough love"". There are 4 nine page ""essay/exams"" to be written (36 total). Not as hard as it sounds though. The whole class you just read, discussions only if someone asks a specific question. Interesting subject overall.",1
JB IS AWESOME.  DEFINITELY ONE OF THE BEST PROFS AT IU AND ONE OF THE BEST CLASSES I HAVE EVER TAKEN.,1
"I absolutely love Professor Rowan! Please take a class with her - she is very passionate about her material and is there to help her students truly succeed. I am not a STEM major, but because she was easily accessible at any time if questions arose for me. Age of Dinosaurs was so much fun - one of my favorites at the college.",1
"Awesome teacher with a nerdy sense of humor. Very knowledgeable in his field with well organized lectures. He cares about his students and the grades they get, but is a fair (not ""easy"") grader, which is respectable. Written assignments aren't hard, but require effort. Notes on blackboard are perfect to go refer to when he gives you the study guide.",1
"4 essays, 2 tests, 15 Connect hwk assignments, 1 final. Study for tests (webcam required if taken at home): 40% of your grade .  Keep up with the syllabus. He is not lenient and does not believe in extra credit. ""A"" is definitely achievable if you treat his class as a priority and do not bother him.",0
"I've had this professor for 3 classes and received A's in every class. (Including two A+'s). He is very easy. However, he is easy for the wrong reasons. Does not teach well. He algorithmizes everything. If you value actually learning, I advise you to stay away from him. It's hard to convey just how little you'll actually learn despite getting an A.",0
"Dr. Kuss would be a great teacher if he could actually teach. He is a very intelligent man but he paces back and forth while lecturing, he mumbles everything, and he never looks his students in the eye. Worst lectures I have ever been through. You will need the book just to teach yourself all the material.",0
"I dropped this class so fast. She's the hardest grader and has pop quizzes every day. She doesn't care about students at all and lowkey bullies them. If you ask for help, she doesn't give it and just tells you to drop the class. Basically makes you learn all the material from videos. But on the up side sometimes her husband shows up with her dog.",0
"Dr. C is one of the most useless teachers I've ever had.  He's unorganized, scattered brained his tests are TERRIBLE. Just pay attention and read the book, and you'll do OKAY. Good guy- horrific teacher.",0
"SUMMARY -- talks about past researchers and his life achievements/adventures with A LOT of passion - wish I could say the same evolutionary biology. His slides are easy to understand, you can leave reciting everything you learned but the tests seem to be a shoot or miss. Some like him for his accent and puns, in reality he ins't that great. :/",0
"On the first day of class I thought I was really going to like this professor; judging by the tie-dye shirt, open-toed sandals and the laid-back attitude. After taking that first exam and completely bombing it, I realized that this class was either a hit or miss. Tests were ridiculously difficult: weirdly-worded questions and odd true/false.",0
"Dr. Anderson is absolutely the best Latin teacher you could hope for. He emphasizes that he is there to help you. If you have any problems with the translations, he takes the time to go over it with you. Regular quizzes, but you'll know what to study beforehand. Make sure to do the translations regularly, and you'll do well.",1
"Seems to care a lot about students, but grades really tough and is unclear with instructions. The class is a guessing game most of the time. If you can avoid this prof, despite how sweet she is, do it.",0
One of the best professors Ive had. I respect her so much & appreciate all she does for her students. I love how passionate she is about what shes teaching. Shell make students participate in discussions only because she cares & wants to hear you out. I love that she makes you feel comfortable in class. I highly recommend taking her class!,1
"Dont know why this lady is teaching. Grades very harshly. Ruins your grade even when nothing was wrong with your assignments (paper worth a B  a D- to her). Nitpicks at tiny tiny things to make you fail. Extra credit only if you buy it on ATI and its only 1 point. Stay away. She is bitter, cold, & entitled. Rude & will not help you at all.",0
"prior posts correct. very cagey re test format, what would be covered etc. material given cursory treatment with focus on theory, as if goal was 2 cover all of book as opposed to understndng rules. unclear as 2 important points, as if all about a case was important. last class insisted on talking about irrelevant material not on exam. AVOID!",0
"She is nice and you can tell that she cares but she is soooo boring. Her teaching style paired with a class like Research Methods is enough to put you to sleep. Attendance counts, you should go. Most work is online, so fairly easy to pass. If you have to take this class, I suggest you go with a different professor if you want to stay awake.",0
"He is a nice guy, but so boring. Do not take a 6-9 with him, you will not get anything out of it. He is slightly monotone so it is hard to stay awake sometimes. Test are pretty easy as long as you prepare and take notes from his lectures.",0
"Yonn is a very dedicated and passionate instructor. He is challenging, but never negative. Extremely well versed in all aspects of planning. Class is never boring. The more classes you take from him, the more he challenges you. Every UWT student should take at least one class from him.",1
"one of the best Japanese teachers I have ever had.  She definitley knows what she's talking about.  Although she could go off track and sometimes her explanations were pretty confusing, simply ask her and she'll do her best to clarify.  Also just email her if you have any questions and she'll get back to you as soon as possible!",1
"Prof. DeBruine cares, but if you care about grades, do NOT take his class. Every test we took had a 65% average, including the curve. After everyone failed the first test, in the next class he did the math on the board and said ""See? You all are still capable of getting a C."" If you go to class, study hard, and do ALL homework, you might get a B.",0
professor hartmark was very enthusiastic with his lectures but they made absolutely no sense. you NEED to read the textbook or else you will not pass. I do not recommend this teacher.,0
"Average professor. Not terrible, not great. If you are an A student he will give you As when it is evident your paper had issues. Seems like he does not read over students work. Marks can vary and he changes his expectations throughout the course.",0
"DON'T TAKE THIS PROFESSOR. It's hard to understand what she wants out of her students. You won't find a rubric/expectations on one page, you have to click on multiple links to find all of the expectations for a single assignment and hope you don't miss any. If you do, your paper won't be graded. Her feedback is far from helpful as well.",0
"Professor Schommer is a genuine guy, but his classes are just really fast-paced and difficult. If you are bad in math, you will struggle. However, he wants you to know the material and will stop to answer any questions. His tests are hard so you really have to know the material.",1
"Dr. Maida is amazing! I took Calculus I with her and she was so clear. She explained the material very well, was always available to ask questions, and she did a lot of example problems on the board. She's the best math prof I have ever had. If I could take every math class with her I would! Take a class with Dr. Maida- she changed calc for me.",1
"This class is relatively easy, but it is frustrating and annoying. The program used and format of the class is completely inefficient and not at all user-friendly.  Rankin is not helpful and cannot even do the activities herself many times. Her teaching is immature and ineffective. I would suggest finding a better professor for this class.",0
CHEE209 The prof thinks that she knows everything. She thinks that she is Lagrange or Fourier. Not humble at all. Thanks but I want to learn from a prof with a minimum of human values!,0
"Prof. Lawless is very passionate about ethics. People complain about not doing well on tests, but it is just a matter of paying attention in class. She is known to ramble, but if you just stick through it, she gives you everything you need to do well. I would take her again because she is funny and nice. Attendance is mandatory for a grade.",1
This teacher doesn't care about her students or what they go through during the semester. If you miss an assignment even if you have documentation why she will not be lenient. Take this any accounting course at a different college because she does not give clear guidance for most assignments especially discussions.,0
"I love her! She is kind and helpful. She will schedule extra rehearsal times just to help you with your part outside of class. She meets with you on regular occasions to check your progress, and the music she picks is always beautiful and interesting.",1
"Elementary school teacher. Suitable for a beginner. And don't expect a high mark from him since you never know his expection. Even though you follow all the steps in your textbook, you'll still lose marks.",0
"Dr. Mike is the best professor I've had so far. The first week he tries to scare off LSA kids, but don't drop him if you need the class. He knows that many (specially engineering) students just want to be over with the class, but he tries his very best to help you understand the material. He's funny even when the material is boring. Exams are hard.",1
By far the worst professor I have had in my entire academic career! Stay clear because his class is a waste of time! You will not learn and he will make offensive jokes. I would not recommend taking him because he yells at you when you ask for help and he is never clear. He will not answer your emails and you will always be left in the dark. AVOID!,0
"First impressions aren't always what they seem.  Although I didn't find him to be a terrible teacher, I did find him to be slightly arrogant as if I was wasting his time.  I have gone to him for help on assignments and projects and have always received it.  Sometimes in class examples aren't so clear, making the homework assignment harder.",0
"He likes to extend class periods as much as possible. He is a very tough grader on homeworks and quizzes. His grading is not very clear and is entirely graded on his judgement. He was much more helpful outside of class. If you're struggling in class, go to the MaRC and it should help.",1
"horrible teaching ethics. not precise,not clear, expectations too high and can not comprehend her expectations,speech/diction is a distraction. if you don't like Lord of the RINGS and that kind of reading, you are going to do bad in grades",0
"Jones was the best! He is so nice and will take a personal interest in you if he sees youre struggling. Reading the stories are mandatory and will love if you come up with different perspectives on stories. He helped me VASTLY with all of my papers because he assigns a lot of rough drafts, but overall you become a better writer cause of it",1
"Amazing prof- so helpful, kind, and hilarious. You will learn a lot.",1
"One the best course I have taken so far. hands-on application development using Html5, css, JavaScript, JQuery ,c# , asp net mvc and Web Api.",1
Most of the notes are given in class so if you don't go to lecture you won't be prepared for the test. There is a lot of homework and in class quizzes but it helps to cushion your grade for the test.,1
Very annoying. Gives zeros on papers for little things such as not having your date right. You can redo them but she takes forever to grade. Boring lectures and gets mad if you dont pay attention. Would not recommend,0
"Mehdi Majbouri is great professor. He teaches material incredibly well so his class is very rewarding in how much you will learn. He is also a very ethusiastic and passionate lecturer. Lectures are always enjoyable and exciting yet never boring. His class is demanding; As withall worthwhile courses, the benefit corresponds with a level of challenge",1
Dearing doesn't try to teach you instead he prefers to complain about other students in his other classes. He is rude and unhelpful. There is little to no hands on projects in any of the courses I have taken. And if you don't know much about networking or computers well you are pretty much on your own cause he doesn't care. Ever.,0
It's best to try to learn from online resources. Some of his classes are useful but most time is spent on debugging.,0
If he's as good at barbecue as his son is then this guy is legit!!!!!!! Also adorable!!!!,1
"he took 10 points off just because I attached files one the back of the report not in between, not clear of what he wants, take a lot of points for no reason. if you write a nice detailed report he will mark you off. he took 5 points off my lab because I wrote the results and explained why ! I wish I didn't take him TOUGH GRADER",0
He's is a very smart professor and his classes are always interesting.,1
"Simply put, David Bernstein is a paradox. One second he says he loves to fail his students, the next he appears very genuine and kind. His grave curves are beyond atrocious, 35% each for both midterm and finals, 10% for programming assignments, and 20% for your own project. But he does have some interesting stories to tell from time to time.",0
Nicest most caring and understanding teacher ever! He is super passionate for it and you can tell he works really hard for all of his lectures. Such a nice smart man!!,1
This is an online class and almost everything is done on connect. The connects for the most part are easy. However the midterm and final are in person and completely ridiculous. Our midterm this semester was 12 multiple choice questions and our final was 16 multiple choice questions. No room for partial credit. Class is ridiculous.,0
Best Philosophy teacher at QU,1
It's a decent class. You'll learn a lot. McHardy is very kind and approachable. The people who say he isn't have no idea what they're talking about.,0
Dr. Walker is a really nice guy. He likes to joke around. I don't like how he favors the athletes tho. I got an A. Just stay on top of the online quizzes and do what you're suppose to do and you'll be fine.,1
"Very diffcult personality, which is too bad because she is great in lectures. She probably should retire because she seems not to enjoy clinicals anymore. Or maybe stick to teaching lecture. Dont get me wrong, she is a wealth of information, but I would never take this prof again.",0
"Took him last semester for BUS101 and now this semester for BUS201 (Marketing). He is an awesome professor. Tests are multiple choice to the point. Listen in class and you will pass the tests. One marketing plan, advice = use LivePlan! And he loves Cheetos (hint)!   #hyperglorical  TAKE HIM!",1
"thick indian accent and a great sense of humor. he helped me out a lot when i forgot to do some quizzes. reopened them for me and wasn't even mad! gives study guides for tests that come straight from his powerpoints, but he won't put them online so take notes!",1
"Prof is unorganized in that she never has a plan for the day so she wastes a lot of time deciding on the spot. Also, she is incredibly boring! The course materials are as outdated as her hairstyle. I earned an ""A"" and only showed up to turn in major assignments, which was great, but not once did I feel challenged to even try.",0
"I don't even know where to begin with this guy. I've never disliked a teacher as much as him. His methods of teaching are enough to confuse anyone. You never know what his expectations are, and it seems that he constantly sets the class up for failure with all the information he expects you to study, with little help or clarity. Very disorganized.",0
"Dr. Gaultney gave so much work that I literally had to ignore the classes that I was actually interested in to get it all done. She isnt a tough grader on homework/labs, but the paper is graded harshly. If you have a heavy course load, do not take her!!!!!!",0
Super great guy! Very positive and very helpful! Generally a nice person and really wants to help you succeed! Highly recommend :),1
"There are readings from all over the board as ""Lib Ed"" would suggest, but then ""Bruce"" tells you what you should actually be thinking about the readings. God can't even help you on the written assignments if you don't regurgitate his liberalistic views on every subject back to him. He encourages participation, but only if it agrees with his opinion",0
"Be prepared to give much detail to your answers when she asks questions, if not she will make you feel that your answer isn't good enough, even when you are right.  Has no sense of humor and is not helpful at all.  I advise you to read your material before coming to class. WOULD NOT TAKE HER AGAIN!",0
"I took this class for my history breadth requirement which is definitely not the move if you're a science major looking for an easy history class. That being said, I actually really liked the format of the class. He gives you all the essay prompts ahead of time, and you can download lecture transcripts. Lots of work essay days, but otherwise chill.",1
"One of the worst professors I ever had so far. Tests are way too hard and not really based on practice tests and book. Even if you re struggling in the class, he doesn't give you a real chance to pass. Stay away from him and his teaching style.",0
"very easy class very good teacher, just make sure you show up to class.",1
"Tough honors physics, solid Christian, wonderful help sessions, curves grades",1
Makes you know first 18 chapters. Unless you've already read the material don't go to class. he doesn't explain well bc the bulk of studying is meant to be done out of class. Tests aren't that hard if you've completely memorized the textbook. I rewrote all 18 chapters and got an A. This class is very very hard by it's  nature not bc of dr feit.,0
"VEry cheery, nice, clear, fair, and helpful. great prof.",1
"I took this class as a GPA booster and boy was I wrong. For the midterms, Mary gave us the format and told us to review the 16+ lecture slides. Too much information and I didn't know what to focus on so it was hard to study for the exam as it was too broad. The info was also all mixed up and hard to follow :(",0
"He is a great professor who really cares about your success in his class. His lectures are very clear and the homework directly applies what was taught in lecture that day. He is clear about what will be on his test and quizzes. If you go to lecture, do the homework and study, you will do great! Would definitely take a class from him again!",1
"Sopariwala is great.  Tests are difficult, but he is a completely fair grader, and grades on a curve.  He is helpful and is always asking if topics are clear to the class.  Lectures aren't mandatory but you will miss out if you don't attend - and he is moderately entertaining.  Two exams and a paper.  He will challenge you but it is worth it.",1
best. professor. (and advisor). ever.,1
"DO NOT TAKE THE ONLINE BUSINESS CLASSES. I am currently in his class and he gives too much work for a week... All the discussion boards are based on Pros and Cons, you have to reply to atleast 5 students (ur grades are based on ur contribution to the board) Quizzes covers weeks u havent even read yet... Save urself the stress. 3 weeks left 4 me.",0
"One of U of T's real gems. Danesi's practically an institution. Always finds ways to make classes more engaging, the course material is easy, and his sense of humor and wit are world renowned. A real honor and privilege being part of his classes.",1
"Prof Nollet is kind of weird? but pretty okay. He's super straight forward. Attendence isn't mandatory but there are LOTSS of quizzes, but they're not difficult at all, and the tests are basically all of the quizzes with different numbers. Difficult, but super straight forward. He isn't a big help on homework... but you don't really need it.",1
"She really wants her students to learn the language. There is a lot of reading and answering questions, but if you do that, you will be fine. Although she says they are quizzes, they are really exams. Utilize what she gives you for the exams. Great prof who cares about her students and who really knows the subject she teaches.",1
"class has surprise graded canvas discussions without notification or warning in class, tests that are impossible to ace, knowing less about the topic than when you enrolled and Homework that's due for an entire chapter ahead of what he's taught. He curves the failing class nearly 30% at the end of each semester to avoid investigation too. 0/10",0
"Dr. Lim is a knowledgeable prof. Notes were clear. However, he is incapable of teaching or getting anything across. Took him in the summer, and it was painful to watch his lectures to get somewhere since he focuses on things that dont matter. His midterms were okay. Final was natural selection. Advice: dont take him unless you absolutely have to",0
He starts talking about one thing then gets lost in different stories and different subjects. He goes off on a long tangent about a subject that has nothing to do with the reading. He does this almost all the time. Not a bad guy pretty nice just hard to follow,0
"The instructions given for the group project were unclear on multiple occasions. When asked for further details, Prof. Schramm would either not respond back to emails, or would give rude responses to students looking for help. There seemed to be a huge lack of communication between the TA's and the professor, which did not help. Do not recommend!",0
She is tough and the exams do not match what you learn in class. the textbook is not helpful as it only explains the basic concepts. She occasionally says something important in class however she reads her notes word for word.,0
She isn't helpful unless you ask her for help and then its hard to understand what she is explaining. She makes too many mistakes on the board. doesnt collect homework. tests are a few questions but worth alot. GOOD LUCK!!,0
"Always interesting, always engaging.  Get on the Borgman Bandwagon today!",1
"Good choice for this class. A quiz every week, 3 essays and a final essay instead of exam. Not too hard, the material is interesting and the essays aren't too bad. Overall, good teacher and class.",1
Mau is a really generous guy. I had 3 essay's due in a week and he gave an extension because I didn't want to have to submit a rushed term paper. He's really understanding of what student's go through and is definitely not out of touch. Topic is pretty dull for the most part and it is hard to follow along with much of the political rhetoric though.,1
"She's uninterested in helping students & ambiguous in all of her communications. She will berate you at her discretion without taking the time to understand your communication. She's a terrible professor who takes ""jumping to conclusions"" to a whole new level. She grades inconsistently. I learned nothing from her class; it's all busywork.",0
I took her class for PSYCH-101 in the UFV Online period were COVID-19 forced everyone to go to Online Classes. Snow doesn't respond to emails (It's been 4 weeks since I have gotten a response). She pretty much posted all content at the beginning and left all the students to figure out the content themselves through the textbook. Do not take PSYC.,0
"Can we rate how much span 301 sucks and is hard...? She is a good person, very very leneant..but is horrible as a teacher. She loses things and cant calculate right. But if you want to learn spanish best you need to learn from the source.. native spea",1
"2 words: STAY AWAY  Hateful, Egotistical, and very opinionated.  Her exams are tough and she is hard to comprehend.  If you are male, you definately want to steer clear.  Femanist Witch.",0
"he is a super nice guy, but the class was overall kind of confusing. the setup of the class was also confusing. he is very much willing to help you or answer questions, but this was my most confusing/hardest class this sem.",0
"I absolutely hated this prof. She asks for opinions, but your opinion is always wrong. She asks lots of questions and if you don't give her the answer she wants, she will belittle you. She made me so frustrated that I almost dropped out of Honors, just to get out of her class. Know everything she says word for word on the essays or you will fail.",0
Professor Lutzer was a tough grader. His lectures were incredibly disorganized and the homework had absolutely nothing to do with the lectures themselves. The only positive aspect of his class was how he included solutions to some selected questions from the homework. If you really want to learn linear algebra take this class with someone else.,0
"This class was a joke. He is all over the place and he never goes over anything. If you wanna sleep in a class, this is it. But you learn nothing and its not even that easy to get an A. B, def. ",0
"All she does is read the damn book. When asking questions, she reads the book for another two minutes seems to answer the question but really is avoiding the question. b/c she doesn't have an answer. Also some test questions are not even motioned in book",0
"I had London last fall and I never knew this website existed until now,  and I am so glad because I feel it is necessary to tell people just how awful this professor was! I have transferred schools because of the poor experience I had with this professor!",0
The fact that no absences are excused except for sporting events was a little much for me,0
"She's an old westbury professor that teaches using video conferencing. Still, she cares about the manhattan students and tries hard to get both classes to participate. She's a clear teacher, and you'll learn A LOT about anthropology with her. Take her if you get the chance.",1
"After taking several classes with him, it just confirmed my love for all things Math and CS. Makes you think, explains stuff clearly and great guy. First day of class with him, it was like ""Yup, this is going to be awesome."" He inspired me to want to get into academia to share my love of CS and Math with others. If you show up/try it will be mint!",1
"HORRIBLE! His tests are super hard, he doesn't have a review for what will be on the test and hardly has any assignments to get more points. He is very judgmental to students who answer his questions and then basically tells them they are wrong if they are not his exact words. Dry personality & doesn't care about anyone but himself. DO NOT TAKE!",0
"Overall Jodee is a nice person, but rambles a lot during lectures. Quizzes every week, 4 exams through out the year, no homework. She is not very good at communicating when quizzes and exams will be during the week and usually throws them out there whenever. Personally would not take her again.",0
"Randal seems shy and has a monotone voice. Thus, if you're taking his 6:50 am class, you'll find it difficult to stay awake. You'll have a reading assignment and a quiz due each week, along with a project relating to the topic. The final is a combination of the quizzes (mean 123/150). Offers XC. All in all, loved this class, fun & creative.",1
"Very nice professor. He really likes this subject. ME on the other hand find it pretty long, and boring. It is an easy class, and he really puts an effort into it. Lots of writing to do. one group project",1
BORING! not very helpful with writting papers!!!,0
"I LOVE professor Aley! She is so sweet and willing to listen to what everyone has to say. Sometimes lectures go off topic, but I always enjoy being in class. Not much work to do until the end of the semester, and she grades very leniently. Very open to people's opinions, and everything you could want in a WRTC professor. I hope to take her again!",1
"His lecture exams are horrible each multiple choice question is 3 pts so if you get 3 wrong you are already 90%  I am really disappointed taking his class I just did not have any choice he was the only one listed for bio 242. Boring lectures not helpful for exams. His study guide is useless, don't spend your money and time.",0
Professor Sanford is a hoss plain and simple. By far my favorite professor I've ever had. His lectures are very interesting and he has a good sense of humor. Be prepared to read and take good notes during his lectures. I highly recommend this beast. I want to take every class he teaches.,1
This professor has a true passion for math . He definitely knows how to teach and helps you understand math.  I recommend taking his class if you have struggled with math.,1
"Very unclear what this guy wants from you in practically every area of this class, especially assignments. No where is it written in words what he wants/expects from you on assignments. Tough.",0
"Seems disinterested in the course, as if he's just going through the motions.",0
"Honestly, the lectures were off-topic and unclear, grading didn't seem logical to me, and attending class was overall redundant. Bottom line, in an educative point of view, I wouldn't take this teacher a second time because I didn't learn how to improve nor was I even able understand my own mistakes.",0
One of the best professors at UW-Green bay! You can tell he really cares about his students and wants them to succeed. His lectures are entertaining and he gives great examples.,1
Professor Prasad is really unorganized. She's really informative but I wouldn't take her for lab. The practical exams are really hard. Seeing the cadaver once won't help you remember the body parts. The open labs are short too. There's so much to remember in so little time. Super hard class & takes forever to grade. I wouldn't recommend taking her,0
"Prof Karlis keeps it old school, and he does not post anything online.  Having said that, he is engaging, respecful, and gives a clear outline on what he expects from the class. What a great professor, and I would recommend him to any student who wants a B or higher.  His midterms and texts can be completed in under 20 minutes.",1
"Great class, great teacher. Very funny, teaches material very well. An excellent photographer. Gives a lot of assignments, but is relaxed about what you do and how you do them. Great class!",1
Didn't really like him as a prof. He would always show up to class saying how he put the lecture together late the night before. His class notes were inferior to the other 1051 prof teaching during the semester and he strayed off track a lot. He was a nice guy to talk too but it seemed like he was more focused on his research then teaching students,0
"Feel kind of bad making this review but I'm going to be honest... She's a nice professor but the workload for pre-calculus is a bit ridiculous. Anyone who has taken calculus knows that pre-calculus is basically an illegitimate subject, so to dump a huge workload of concepts that will soon be replaced is inefficient and tiresome.",0
"I could never recommend this professor.  His lectures are uninspired and quite frankly a waste of time, his homework assignments are extremely inflexible (especially to those who have work hours), and he gives quizzes on material irrelevant to anything we've done in class.  He rarely answers class questions and also curves downward.",0
"Shes pretty easy. Allows you to have a cheat sheet during test. Nice lady, even gives out extra credit from time to time just for writing your name or something a kid can do. Interesting topics too, never was boring.",1
Professor Abdo is very passionate about her work and it shows in the feedback she provides her students. She never leaves her students in the dark and when she says she'll do something she does it. In this class you get what you give.,1
Just avoid him.  Take the other professors who understand students and how they learn.,0
"Amazing professor who really cares and knows his stuff! Makes class as interesting as he can and presents all the material. Very, very well organized!",1
Outstanding Professor.  Mr. Eberle knows his stuff.,1
"this is the hardest marking professor i have ever had.  he is very rigid in his delivery, and only allows things done one way.  he had a 15 minute quiz worth 5% of the entire class grade based on a 350 page book.  i would never take a class from this prof again.",0
"Palfai is really passionate about this course, He knows and can explain everything well. The tests are the most important part of this course and they can be tricky.",1
"Lauren was very unhelpful all semester. Cancelled class every few weeks, and had really brief classes with the material ever fully being covered. Was unclear, didn't take in people's opinions, and marks VERY unfairly. GPA killer for sure. Would not recommend. Very disappointing. Exams are unfair and trys to trick you on almost every question.",0
He shows up about 5 minutes late everyday.,0
The way she teaches is confusing. She expects you to know how to do problems before she explains them and then when you don't know the answer she acts like your stupid. The class average for the second test we took was 60%. Then she gave us a 25 minute lecture about how we should have done better.,0
"His lectures hold most of the info for your assignment each class so just pay attention in the beginning. Half of our class was graded by the TA and another was graded by Sullivan, he takes off for the simplest things, so you're in luck if you don't sit in his section. He's cranky, but'll give you the answers, just a SUPER harsh grader.",0
"Pellathy is the man, period. Took all of his classes and barely ever went. He is awesome. Wish he taught more classes. Really has helped my GPA. Take him as many times as you can!!!",1
"Unfortunately, this is just a terribly made class that has seen little improvement in the years that it has been offered. McEntie isn't a bad instructor, but his lectures are boring and lots of filter talk. The textbook is not extremely helpful either. I wished they could use articles online since that has helped me much more. Hard class for a 100.",0
Dr. Celli was a good instructor for FREN107 and cared about her students. She made the classes interesting and involved culture when discussing tenses or other conventions learned at the Intermediate level.,1
"He's a great person. He's a really hard prof. In class, he expects a lot of studying and paying attention. If you are not doing either, you will be get slapped by the midterms and finals.",1
Poorly organized and poorly taught. Completely unclear on what you should even be trying to learn during the lecture. Types random words on Microsoft word for notes but doesn't explain how they are used in relation to the topic or what we need to know about them.,0
"Camarena is super laid back and funny. Gets off topic sometimes, but in a 2-hr math course it is refreshing. Cares about students passing and taking school seriously. His lectures are straightforward and takes the time to answer student questions.",1
"I am not a philosophy major but I took his class thinking I would do a phil minor. The class  made me realize how difficult philosophy can be and never finished the minor but the class was a pleasure nonetheless. Searle is endlessly entertaining, charming, funny, brilliant.",1
"Math 31 with Long was great. The tests are very similar to the hw problems. Hw is graded on accuracy and turned in on paper. Test heavy but so is every other MATH 31 class. She is very approachable if you don't understand a concept, you just have to see her during office hours.",1
"I loved him! What we wrote about was fun and he was just hilarious! However, little things like not turning in papers, being late, and talking in class can sometimes set him off. Just be a good student and he will love you!",1
I suggest switching out of his class ASAP if you're not a quick learner. Mr. Bannow will expect you to know things he vaguely goes over (like the math portions of chapters). Be ready to teach yourself or hire a semester long tutor or you WILL be lost. He will get angry/frustrated if you have any questions. Most impatient teacher I've ever met.,0
"Hands down the best professor I've ever had at TCU, he made the 8 ams worth. Theres a lot of reading involved but the class is really practical and he makes it quite fun. Not an easy A, and you do have to work for a B, but if you do your reading and extra credit, you'll be fine.",1
First class I've ever gotten a D in.. I got a tutor but nothing helped. The tests were too hard. I'm currently retaking the class with another professor and I have an A. He's a good guy though! His teaching style simply did not work for me.,1
"Doug is dope. Made 8 AM's enjoyable for the most part, and always makes sure you know what to study for the tests.",1
"This is one of the best teachers I have ever had at pikes peak. I would take his class again in a heart beat. he likes to make sure you are keeping up with the reading by giving quizzes, but he only keeps the top 3. ",1
"She told us in her exact words to suck it up and buy Microsoft Word, even though many students (including me) dont have the money. She literally laughs at us struggling and makes everything extra challenging so we fail and learn. Terrible strategy. I will be avoiding her for the rest of my time at HSU if possible. Hardest class Ive ever taken",0
"Genuine enthusiasm in subject matter, always avaiable to help students and discuss current research, fair & considerate.",1
"Michael Elliot is an awesome professor. Not only does he nail down on information that you need, but he also has plenty of useful advice to go with it. His group projects may seem scary at first but he's there to offer guidance towards achieving your project's goal. All of the effort he puts into the class is for your benefit, so take advantage!",1
"Excellent teacher.  Not a breeze, but not too difficult if you put forth effort.  Great class.  Limited homework.",1
"Very very hard to get a hold of. If you ever have to make something up, good luck finding a time to meet with him. Nice guy, but not really too involved",0
"Love Mrs. Bartee! She is very helpful, easy to follow and gives a great study guide. I highly reccomend her!",1
"Just drop the class and get a different instructor in the very beginning of the semester. Trust me. I'm a hardworking student but this one particular class is just not worth my time. Every time I enter the room, the atmosphere is just horrible.",0
took him for cell bio lab and re-registered with him for genetics lab. hes the best!!,1
"Dr. Puneet seems like she is trying to do a good job but she just isn't. In terms of learning, you would probably get more out of listening to an audio version of the text book at 2x speed. If you have to take her I suggest doing the homework in class and watching Khan Academy or Organic Chemistry Tutor videos for the stuff you haven't encountered.",0
"Really good professor who takes his time to explain anything youre struggling with. He tries to make time for group work, and is available outside of class times for additional help if needed. Can be pretty picky about notation on turned in assignments but nothing that cant be fixed. Gave worksheets before tests which were very helpful as well.",1
Professor Z is a good teacher but this class is definitely not an easy A. She is a harsh grader and can sometimes be too harsh of a grader. Do not take her course if you don't want to put the work in. I had an A for pretty much the entire semester but then it went down to a B because she started grading harder. Do not take her!,0
"Kochaneck is a great guy, and he really wants us to learn the material. However, the class content builds on itself, so you really need to make sure you understand the basics. This course requires 110% of effort and relies heavily on your own studying and learning outside of the class period.",1
PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF YOUR OWN SAKE DON'T TAKE HIS COURSE IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO. PLEASE. ,0
"he's a really cool guy, but with type of subject matter, you'd think he could make it a little more interesting. even lab is a sleeper, though you'll regret it since class participation is 20% of grade!",0
I REALLY enjoyed Dr. Schulhoff. Class is easy with weekly online quizzes. Attendance is not mandatory but is counted toward your participation/in-class activities grade. Only two tests (midterm and final). This professor really does care about getting to know her students and tries to make the class material enjoyable and relevant for everyone.,1
boring,0
"John Cole really cares about his students. The tests are more difficult than they need to be, I never made an A on either of the two. Only two tests and two group projects that require a decent amount of effort. The tests are a lot of material and you have to take good notes and read the textbook to pass the tests. Learned a lot about sales!",1
"He is bright and knows his stuff.  Yet, he has an attitude and a certain kind of arrogance that made me dislike him.  I got a good grade and worked hard, but I was so put off by him that I avioded his classes after this one.",0
Made us use a graduate students book for a 100 level class. Wasted lecture time. Way too high of expectations and provide little help outside of class.,0
"Absolutely HATE this class. I am usually a straight A student but on the midterm made a 78. Everything is VERY vague from his power points, to his lectures, to the exams, and also the final project. His grading system is bogus. Based on his views only. I thought this LBST class would be my easiest class but I'm making the worst grade in it.",0
This class was more like a honors level course. The class was completely unbearable and it didn't help that the professor was extremely not helpful. She had no idea what she was talking about. She assigns way to much hw. Way too many papers are handed out. And journals for a math class!?,0
"Lolita is a great professor.  Dont go to her class expecting to earn an A, but you will learn so much along the way!  This class helped my acting immensely.   It was challenging but through this class i added some great audition pieces to my repertoire. Lolita cares a lot about her students and spent an afternoon working one on one with me! Awesome",1
"Awesome dude. Definitely have to attend the lectures AND read the online TB if you want an A, but it's not very difficult if you keep up with them. Passionate about his field and is very good at expressing and explaining that passion. Some EC but you can certainly get an A without it.",1
"smart, easy going and helpful. knows his stuff.",1
This history class was interesting because it focused on the sides of US hist that you don't extensively learn about in high school. Grades papers harshly but going to office hours helps. Tests were short answer and also pretty difficult. There's a weekly textbook quiz on canvas but he drops the 2 lowest grades. Not an easy A but it is possible,1
"Great guy, but not necessarily the best teacher.  His anecdotes are great though",1
"Hands down the best if not one of the best professors I've ever had. I've been in college for about 5 years now, and Mike has every single quality a teacher needs to have. I wish he taught more classes because if I could I'd fill my entire schedule with Mike as my instructor.",1
"This class is really ""Teach yourself Digital Hardware Design"", not much in class teaching going on.  Dr Rafla is fairly helpful if you ask for help.  Assignments/projects were huge, tended to be thrown together and not super clear.  Whoever graded was pretty harsh at times.  Interesting material but better off learning it on your own.",0
"Not sure I really have any commnents, just wanted to rate.",1
"I cannot learn from just reading a textbook, and thats how he teaches. I'm failing because he does not explain anything, he just stands up there and erads the book to us. I didn't pay for an online course, I want a teacher!I was so excited to start classes, and now I'm ready to quit.",0
"A very informative and enriching class. A class that all sociology majors should take, as well as anyone who takes it as an AGNG class.",1
"Seems like a good guy, but one of the WORST classes I've ever had to endure. I just came here to get transfer credit back to my college. The class is easy to get an A IMO, but the quality of lectures/education is god awful. The lectures videos are extremely low quality so you can't see what he's writing and his accent makes it impossible to hear.",0
"INCREDIBLE prof. Truly a gem. She gave my class her personal phone number in case we needed help on understanding concepts. So passionate about her work and very involved with the students. There's something about her that differentiates her from all other profs at University of Ottawa, I can't quite explain it. Just incredible.",1
He's really a great guy. I had him for the Tagaste program so I was taking two classes with him over my freshman year so I really got to know him. You only write 4 papers and you have a total of 7 pop quizzes over the semester. He is a little confusing as he goes off on tangents and barely covers all the previous reading,1
Assigns too much homework and offers little assistance inside of class. Does a horrible job in explaining and communicating his lectures.,0
"While the amount of books he requires you to buy may seem overwhelming, the ""required"" reading isn't actually required.  He will tell you specifically what chapters he will test you on.  Also be aware that when he says ""In a hypothetical test taking environment..."" he really means ""This will be on the test"" (which he does often)",1
"DO NOT TAKE HER! She is the hardest proffesor in San Jac! She reads the power pint, she does a review one day before the test and it a useless, nonses review ever! She replies email very late, she is not a good proffessor. If you want an A spare yourself and take another proffessor!",0
"She's really cool, and she helps out quite a bit. She also makes some serious and funny quips that might go over some peoples heads.",1
"If you cannot get an A in Bowen's Safety 201, chances are you are not college material. Pay attention, take notes, study a little. If you are unable to do these three things, that's your fault. She's nice, has a good personality, and has a very clear way of presenting information. I would recommend her to anyone.",1
"very knowledgeable and passionate professor. makes every class interesting and is extremely entertaining/hilarious. if you read the books and go to class, it's an easy A! quizzes are short answer and sometimes very specific; making flashcards will become your BFF. one of my favorite classes/professors EVER at UNCC.",1
Does not care about students and it shows!  Multiple choice exams ... he does not care about student learning!!,0
"Patient, and brilliant economist. Cannot explain things well, so this class is one of the most difficult to be at.",0
"Dr. Saarnio is a wonderful instructor if you want to actually learn something.  His class is not too easy but not impossible either. Pay attention and study a bit and you'll do fine. Keeping in mind that if you are here to float through classes because mommy said you have to, this is not the instructor for you!",1
"I'm not interested in science, however, Feldman's passion made me enjoy the class and my grade reflected it. Very important information for our generation and he makes it relatable. I learned far more than I expected to. He makes the tests very fair, just show up, pay attention, and use the practice tests. He wants you to succeed & help the Earth:)",1
"He's not organized, and when he teaches you don't know what chapter he's on which makes it confusing",0
"Professor Drake is an incredible lecturer and is an inspiration for students. If you have an interest in acquiring an extensive reading list of material with a focus on fanaticism and terror around the world, you will be rewarded by the course. His required reading for the course is demanding, and you will not succeed in his class if you skip.",1
"Fair professor. Make sure you actually practice Arena in your own time though or you're screwed. Keep up with the work he assigns, or you will be lost. Nice guy though. Takes attendance.",1
"If I had an accurate portrayal of what his class was really like, I never would've taken it in a million years. Don't expect to actually learn that much about epidemiology. This class had the potential to be awesome but fell totally flat because of the prof. Got an A but would never put myself through that again. His personality gave me gray hairs.",0
"If you're looking for a passive history class to coast through this GUR, DO NOT TAKE GILL. She's under the dire misimpression that her students want to take the class seriously - THEY DO NOT.   Obscure questions, tons of homework reading for EVERY class, low quality preparation material before exams, often late to class. 2/10 would not take again",0
"She is a very intelligent woman, but teaching is not her strong suit. She goes through the material very quickly and crams about 4 exams into the last week of the semester. I had to study for more than 8 hours for each exam (there were several) because  she was difficult to understand. It's not her fault for having a Russian accent though.",0
"He was super vague about his assignment expectations, he never gives out the 'right answers'. He would drag on explaining the proper 'concept' but then never reached to the end to state the right answer. His time management/organization sucked. Assignments too vague/assigned at worst times. ",0
"A guy that has done it all, youll love his cool life stories that he talks about. Really cares about his students, wants you to do well, responds fast and available after class. Makes teaching fun, you learn so much! Great choice",1
No hw besides reading &I never did it and still did well. He means well and he's very smart but he doesn't use moodle or any form of technology so no powerpoints and he rarely emails back. He's not a very clear speaker so you walk away from class knowing as much as you did walking in. Just research for the exams and look @ notes and youll be good.,1
"Good lecturer, but his lectures are all about theory and not about how to solve the problems on his tests, which look nothing like the problems in the textbook and he gives no problems sets or quizzes to prepare. Not helpful or interested in helping - refused to explain a basic concept in office hours because it was below him. Avoid at all costs. ",0
"I usually love taking a history class, however this was the most boring history class I've ever had. Its basic U.S. so I'm not sure why it was so difficult. I take good notes however the quiz questions were just all over the place. Fitzpatrick did know what he was talking about, but he didn't present the information in the best way.",0
"Dadlez is an amazing woman and a great professor. The subjects that you talk about in class can seen boring or even a little hard to understand but, she'll help you out if you put in the effort. Allows 15 unexcused absences and gives study guides and review days. Also likes to watch movies and videos.",1
"I don't have words to describe how upset I am with McMurry. Just save yourself the unnecessary aggravation and don't take her. Ever. She's having an exam the Thursday before finals week, and then our final's the Tuesday of finals week. And the final is all new material. This is just one out of many crazy things she's done. Do. Not. Take. McMurry.",0
He gave no one in the class an A.,0
"Sheryl is a great professor, but she gets off topic a lot. Thought this was a media editing course, but we focused a lot on feminism",1
"Prof. Ding is nice when chatting, but you really don't learn anything with him. You ask for help and his reply is ""Refer to such and such handout"" and he's very critical on your spelling, grammar etc. but half the time what he sends can't be understood due to poor spelling. If you can help it, avoid taking a class with him.",0
"RUN, RUN, RUN FAR AWAY! Student beware do not take this person ever for anything. I too look on here and saw his bad rating and still took him and regreted each moment. Test are hard and extremely detailed. The worse EVER!",0
"One of the worst teachers that I have had at GV. His lectures are extremely unorganized and he repeats himself a lot. He is very arrogant and disrespectful to students. He doesn't like questions and expects you to figure it out on your own. However, if you work hard you can get an A in the class. Do not take him for Lab! He is super hard grader.",0
"I took 4 years of Spanish in high school, and I learned more in 10 weeks with Marks than I did in the past 4 years.  The Wiley Plus (on-line assignments) is annoying at times, but I do not mind going to class.  He explains everything really well, and although he is a tough grader at times, you will still learn a lot and do good if you actually try.",1
"Profs okay, he does not mark the cases, he just assigns a random average to different students. I got 78-80% on every case, and a student in my class with a 1.9 GPA got the same grades. He will give you the option for an in class or take home exam DONT DO THE IN CLASS! The take home Is a case study from the text. My class made the wrong choice.",1
He isn't clear at all. He's an awful teacher. You don't learn anything but the stuff he gives you is already all in French.,0
A teacher? I would say more like a textbook reader...  If you want to learn something do not take his class. He would read directly out of the textbook for an entire class period.  Easy A but he is one of the most unclear and boring teachers I have ever met. If you care about learning avoid at all costs!!!! Go buy the textbook and save your time!!!,0
"Please do yourself a favor and do not take a class from this guy. Unless youve already taken the class you wont understand a thing. The lectures are clear enough, but he goes off on long tangents about unnecessary problems. Outside of the lecture, you will be completely lost. Tests are nigh impossible, and quizzes contribute way too much. Dont.",0
"Your grade for the whole semester will be determined solely by your grades on the four exams. There is little room for error. Also, you will most likely get frustrated in class if you do not agree with Mr. Wingender's political views, because he spends most of the time trying to push his views on you.",0
"David Pace shows serious interest in his students work and research. If you are willing to go out of your way to talk to him, he'll offer a lot of helpful advice.",1
"The GOOD: 
 - He uses a points system for grading, and gives you points for attendance.
 - Some of his quizzes are group quizzes, which are easier to pass.
 - Gives out a lot of extra credit work
 The BAD:
 - very unorganized
 - A lot of essay assignments
 - Made our class purchase access to an online program called MyCompLab which we used ONLY ONC",0
"I learned the majority of the content for this course by going to the math tutoring lab or by using the ""help me solve this"" button on the online homework. Mrs. Ryburn is very willing to help you one-on-one, but does not do well with lectures. The class talks over her and does not pay attention. Class is almost pointless because it is all online.",1
"He gives extra credit for coming to class, otherwise I would not have attended as much as I did. He reads right off of his PowerPoint, and is very difficult to understand because he mumbles. He did answer questions if students asked. Be prepared to study a lot unless you have a lot of prior econ knowledge. I would avoid his classes if possible.",0
"- first few classes emphasizes on the historical background of finance.  - need to write 2 long essays and several reflections - very late with handing back quizzes and essays. - lecture is very unorganized - lecture is hard to follow. lots of digression.  - final is hard, midterm is substituted with several mini quizzes.   DO NOT TAKE THIS",0
"Students only like Garyen because he is funny and caring in lectures. In terms of actually learning something in his class, chances are you probably have to learn it yourself. He's forgetful and sometimes tests you on material that you haven't even learned in lecture and not even found in the textbook which is unfair. He's not as hype as you think.",0
"Monotonous. If you need to catch up on some sleep, just listen to his lectures.",0
He's great and fair to students.,1
"Isn't clear in directions and blames students when they don't know what to do. I passed this class but worked harder than ever, not because he was tough on me, because he doesn't know what he wants. In my opinion, you should only need to get help from TAs and GAs if you are struggling, it should not be an essential part of passing.",0
He really knows what he is talking about and goes in depth into all topics.,1
One of the most helpful professors out there; will make you work hard for your grade but will bend over backwards to help you achieve your goal. Amazing lectures and very knowledgeable. Take advantage of office hours. Definitely would take again!,1
I have Professor Carr atm and he is really resourceful and tells class long stories. Be sure not to miss too much and always raise your hand.,1
"I was so fortunate to get Baumgartner for Lec AND Lab. I recommend him to every single person that asks. Compared to what I know about Noe & Evans, Baumgartner will be your absolute best chance at walking out of this class with an A (whoever said it's near impossible to get a C is so wrong). He cares about his students and that helps tremendously.",1
"Everyone seems to have a problem with the amount of reading, but as history students, they should be used to it. Did about 2-3 hours of homework a week, and 3 papers for the semester and got an A. Not the easiest class ever, but you'll learn a lot. ",1
At least i got some much needed sleep during his lectures,0
Habash is THE MAN! Most caring and nicest prof I have ever had!,1
"Toughest professor I've ever had, and unforgiving. Miss more than seven days and you automatically get 20% taken off your grade, even if you're doing well in the class. Pointless stories that don't relate to class, and tests are impossible.",0
"Dr. Strange is a very knowledgeable and entertaining professor. Class is interesting and often hilarious. I didn't find his tests particularly hard, especially since he offers bookoos of extra credit for showing up to lecture. If you have even the slightest interest in the outdoors, then I highly recommend FWF 250.",1
"Professor Turcotte is a very tough grader, but also doesn't really give clear guidelines for what he expects out of the assignments. Not really easy to email with as he has resent the unclear instructions for assignments. The google earth assignments are very time consuming for only 20 points.. Not worth the frustration or taking the class.",0
thinks he knows more than he does...and goes really fast,0
He makes you work probably harder than any other WU prof but u will learn your stuff.,1
can seem ODD and senseless at times. very smart but ur interpretation of the reading must be consistent with his preconceived beliefs. 3 essays and light readings. does not give a coherent explanation as to why you received a particular grade on ur essays.,0
Very hard to understand. He takes pleasure in failing his students. Small man maybe compensating for something... Do not take his class. First day he stated that very few people will pass. He said this with a smile.,0
"Dr. Daly's class is the intellectual experience of a lifetime. He is a brilliant professor who's teaching enables you, not just to better confront and understand literature, but to make better sense of the world and learn to lead a better life. I highly recommend him to anybody. He is transformative.",1
Jim is an awesome professor. He goes over everything you NEED to know for Social Work. No busy work or beating around the bush!,1
"Professor Difonzo does not clearly communicate what he expects in his senior capstone class. He is extremely vague and wouldn't give specific feedback or ideas. It was hard to figure out what he wanted, and he didn't seem to like anything I wrote.",0
Zimmerman threw the syllabus out the door in the first couple of weeks of class. She would switch deadlines and move points around because she forgot to give us a midterm. This class was not made a priority. My advice: avoid her and this class at all costs during the rest of COVID. The only positive thing I can say is that she responds to emails.,0
"Professor Galen was a weird guy, but had a good sense of humor. This class could be hard to teach, but he made the material easy to understand, and made the room less uncomfortable. He only graded on pop quizzes, exams, and extra credit though, so make sure to study! My advice - do study groups, it helped me raise my grade hearing what others had.",1
"Professor Dillery highly values attendance and participation (i.e. skipping is a BAD idea in his class). However, for the effort I have put into his class, he has put in exponentially more to make the course material come to life. He is highly respected, immensely knowledgeable, and I am going into my third semester taking a class with him.",1
While he's a nice guy his class is way too much work for the lack of instruction and clear guidelines. He uses one google doc instead of blackboard which is annoying because you have to constantly check that doc. No grade book so you don't know what you get until the class is done. Expect tons of busy work and too many hours spent on assignments.,0
Sherry is just awesome!,1
"Dr. Green is a really great professor! Very clear in her lectures and expectations of in her class. There was only one test, one paper, a group project, and a final. She would even let students turn in papers early and give amazing feedback to help improve your final grade. Very accessible outside of class and supportive of students. Would take!",1
Participation was easy since the class is so entertaining that it makes you want to attend. The midterms were ok but the final was a lot tougher than expected. The TA mentioned there would be a lot of similar questions from the midterms and there was none at all. I was hoping this class would boost my GPA but it was overall harder than I thought.,1
"very fair marker and entertaining lecturer (although sometimes irrelevant material) Go to the super tutorial, you'll get a good mark.",1
"He uses a rather easy textbook (A probability path) and does not go into details much further than the textbook. So, if you want to get a good mark but not learn a lot, he's the man! About the exams: Usually all the questions of the midterms are from a rather short list of problems he has provided in the class. Final exam is a bit tougher.",1
"In my opinion, she took a ridiculous amounts of points for items graded and was clearly unfair in her grading.  Her grading comments were very unclear. An example, post 2 responses for discussion boards to meet the minimum requirements. The she takes a point because you only posted two.  How can you take points for meeting requirements?",0
he is ok professor! not really good ! he is confusing and his tests are hard and hard marking !!,0
Ms. Feagin knows a lot about American history but I feel that she tries to cram too many activities into one semester.,0
Ignorant; with a huge complex of inferiority; he compared the Trinity with the three stooges; envious about my excellence in writing and thinking;,0
"She is one of the most sincere teachers I've ever had. Not only does she have a genuine interest in the material, but also in her students' success. Her discussions were inspirational, relevant, and thought provoking. Not an easy A but would take again. ",1
"Dr. Kramer is an awesome professor. Being a CFP, he has lots of knowledge in the realm of financial planning. Don't skip class and make sure you buy the textbook. I made the mistake of not buying it for his class, and since the powerpoints were not posted, it made the class much harder.",1
save yourself and go to change or another prof,0
General Biology is all lecture and the their are 4 test based on the notes. The tests are really hard. He curves them to a low C. The test average is usually Ds and Fs. He gives out very seldom extra credit and attendance matters! He keeps you awake in lecture with a little bit of humor. Doesnt round up your grades!,1
Dude is a bro. Legitimately take him if you have an opportunity.,1
Vogel is an amazing professor! He does not take attendance but I recommend attending regularly.,1
Professor Hamilton is by far the easiest choice for COB 202. She loves teaching the course and her class is very engaging. Easy A that should boost your COB GPA.,1
"Pierce is a fine teacher as far as material is concerned, but where he lacks is in giving consistent feedback. He sometimes will knock a bunch of points off a test because he did not explain what to do for the entire section and marks it 'incomplete'. Theres also a bit of homework but not much, just a tough and odd grader.",0
"Not only is he the most boring man alive, he is also rude. If you don't give him the vague answer he has in his head he chastises you in front of the class. Don't speak up, Don't worry no one else knows what he's lecturing about either and Let's all pray he retires soon.",0
"She is the most amazing teacher, I wih she taught all the science classes. She does everything she can to prepeare us for tests. She;s also very organized and gives us everything ahead of time si if you are lost or not prepared its only your fault. I never liked science in my life but she makes it so enjoyable, I've learned so much!Great teacher!",1
"Stephaine Crockett is awesome! I would recommend her to anyone for the intro class. She is very specific on what she wants for each assignment and will help you with any questions you have (especially apa formatted papers) She is real and honest about the conseling world. Great class, good discussions, fun assignments and never a dull moment!",1
"I fell asleep every class because it was so boring, eventually I stopped going. Students only showed up for midterms. His midterms are all multiple choice, mostly memorization stuff. It wasn't an easy course but wasn't hard. Go to class and you will do fine. ",0
Thinks of himself as a little quaint Scottish man when underneath lurks the heart of a bitter Marxist. Condescending and painfully quite (read: boring). Read his work online (read: his blog?) before you write anything for him and mimick his writing style. Results guaranteed.,0
SHE IS BY FAR THE RUDEST PROFESSOR! like why be a professor if your going to have that rude look on your face when students seek for help. I highly don't recommend this professor,0
Tryed fighting my grade many times and he refused to change it. Worst class Ive ever taken because of the strict details needed.,0
"He is very kind and patient. His classes feel like forever though. Class can be very boring and slow but its an English class so I expected nothing less. He is very helpful and clear on what he wants on his assignments. I haven't gotten my grade for the class yet but im positive I got no lower than a B+ because I do the work. Overall, nice prof!",1
"This teacher is an extremely tough grader and has ridiculously high expectations. Her feedback is confusing, and she has little sympathy. My friends in other writing 150 courses say it is much easier. Her idea of a ""substantial revision"" is a paper that looks brand new every time. Which is unreasonable. I wouldn't recommend her as a writing teacher",0
"Great professor. Sometimes she made things a little too easy. She really dumbs things down for people who don't understand. Easy class without having to even go over the homework problems at all, which aren't even mandatory.",1
"Not very clear, not very helpful.",0
Extremely boring. You will hate your life for the hour during which he speaks,0
"If I had a dollar every time he was condescending, I'd probably be the next Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos. He's very knowledgeable but lacks wisdom.",0
Took SI101R (with another prof) and did well. And then decided to take 102R and he excepted us to be masters of the language even though we were still in a 100s course. Will not take another course with him AGAIN!!  ,0
"hes not very nice when u mess up, doesnt offer much help",0
"TERRIBLE PROF!!! Had him and Dr. Harley (had choice to attend 3 prof's lectures based on skill level) and it was brutal! Keep in mind I'm a Bio major so I had no prior knowledge of coding, but every prof built off knowledge you were already expected to know, so if you don't you're basically screwed! Midterms and exam were 7 multiple choice...",0
Dr. Liszka is really talented as a lecturer and I enjoyed all of her lectures. U need to take serious notes and she gives some serious exams but I found when I studied I did well and when I didn't study it hurt.,1
"I took this class over the summer for transfer credits, and it was my worst experience so far. I learned absolutely nothing. There are no video lectures, no powerpoints, no anything, just a syllabus that guides you with what chapters to read. Weekly 2-3 page writing assignments, 2 take home tests. didnt read textbook at all except for definitions.",0
"i took 3 courses with her, i got 2 ""A"" and ""B+"" i'm graduating this semester and planning to be a special student next year if she teaches night classes   tests are fair if you attend classes and go to her office hours and you will find her very helpful   i like her ",1
Great professor. Gives study guides. Test are based off lectures.,1
"Its like having that miserable Italian grandma next door as your professor. You have to love her because shes Italian, but man she has no buisness teaching in the year 2020",0
"Professor Thanajeyan's class is easier for those that have prior coding experience. For those without any coding experience, you will need to spend more time reading the book and paying attention during lectures. The labs are discussed in class and his final is based off of his lectures so it pays off to attend them. Also, do read the book.",1
"Dr. Shapiro is a very sweet lady! She goes fairy slowly, making it a bit hard to focus. Her exams are pretty much nothing like the study guide: you basically have to read the textbook thoroughly and pay attention in class. 87 is an A and she gives a lot of extra credits though! Her mini-quizzes can sometimes be a bit difficult as well",1
"I took the web course during Spring.  Tests are straight out of Powerpoints.  There will be group projects to do, which is odd, since it is a web course.  It is kind of a pre-accounting course.",1
"I really liked Ethan. A lot of people dont, he just takes some getting used to. pretty young & incredibly extra but its nice to have a professor like that. gave like 100 extra credit assignments, theres no reason anyone shouldnt have an A. Hes pretty new so still working on finding a teaching style that works for him. cares about his student A LOT",1
"Aleman was one of the worst professors I have ever had. Not only was he disrespectful and rude,  but is condescending to his students. During his lectures he talks in round about ways that make no sense at all about easy topics.  He calls out students and makes them look dumb if they do not agree with him. Avoid at all costs!",0
i wil not ever take a class with him again because i almost fell asleep during his class,0
"I didn't like her teaching styles at all. She is a very nice lady but she does biased grading. If you are not one of her favorites, expect to work extra hard to get a good grade. If you are one of her favorites, good for you. I worked hard in this class and she didn't seem to care about my opinion on any of the projects even though it was mandatory",0
"I couldn't stand this class. The lectures were coma-inducing and the assignments were convoluted and based on archaic programs virtually useless in the modern world. The prof is a Mac fanatic which is annoying as almost everything you'll learn is on a Mac. I found her fairly disorganized and not particularly helpful, though she had good intentions.",0
"Professor Ramamoorthy can be a bit tough to understand at times, due to his accent. However, if you make an effort to communicate and truly understand what he wants from an assignment, it can be much easier. He grades very leniently and is very nice, and understanding. The key is to make sure you communicate with him continuously.",1
"Professor McGivern's class is very test heavy!!! His lectures semi-correspond with the exams, but the textbook makes up a good portion of the exams. He is very understanding (at least for my semester), and was kind to our class. He is a smart man and definitely knows what he is teaching. This class was pretty difficult, but not impossible.",0
"Dr. Wolff is amazing. All of her quizzes are open book and online. She also does not require a book, she provides everything you will need online. She is AMAZING! Would definitely take her again.",1
"McGivern is one of my favorite professors Ive had at SDSU. Even though his lectures are long, he is very knowledgeable and intelligent on the topic. There is a quiz almost every class but if you keep up with his lectures AND DO THE STUDY GUIDES you should be good. He offered extra credit and I didnt do any of it and still got an A. Take him!",1
"This class requires a lot of self discipline and study. As long as you study everything she covers and keep up with the assignments, youll do fine...bio major or not. Debby was very helpful and even met with me a few times to go over some tough material. Shes willing to make time for her students and if you put forth the effort, youll get the grade",1
"He is very interactive and energetic.  He is very engaging, especially if you engage him first.  Be sure to go into the classes in a good mood so you can enjoy all of the antics and robot noises!!!",1
Utterly incoherent. His lectures are a colossal waste of time - just review the slides on your own.,0
"There is not much teaching in this course in fact he is quite inconsiderate,  won't provide preparation material and doesn't help you in anyway. Likes to be authoritative but ends up looking silly. I pay too much money to hqve my time and effort wasted by such.  Bye",0
"Very respectful and easy professor. His lectures are very long, but the way he went about them I for sure take a class of his again.",1
"Lectures were boring, as were the 3 books assigned to read. 300 pages about inventing the wheel were just too many, as were the other books page counts. Theres only 2 exams and a 10-page paper. Hard to tell whats important and whats not during his lectures, making studying difficult. The course is not worth the effort required to do well in it.",0
"One of the best profs, I've had a Calvin!  Exams are very comprehensive, but fair.",1
"Mrs. McMeans has been my favorite professor, so much so that I took her two semesters in a row. Her classes are interesting and mostly discussion based. She ties in current events and encourages the class to voice there opinions and share relevant experience. She rules. Take her class, you will not regret it.",1
I am not any good in Math but I learned so much in his class. He also offered extra credit and it bumped my grade from a B to an A. During COVID classes online Spring 2020 he did a great job in teaching through zoom. Easy to follow online! 100% Recommend and would take again!!,1
Knows what shes talking about. Always so prepared for class and explains things great. Makes a lot of handouts and is very on top of things,1
Gave assignments with no direction and everything was subjective grading. You will probably be fine if he likes you but his style is ridiculous and i would never take him again. Was not an understanding guy and it was always his way or the highway.,0
"I had Kim for lecture and lab. She's amazing in lab, but dismal in lecture. She would go off on tangents, then speed through the remaining slides expecting you to understand everything. Her final was filled with mechanisms she told us about last minute. If you try to get points back, don't expect her to be nice. Hard HW. Very unprepared for 3020:/",0
"Best teacher hands down! If you attend class, you will surely receive at least an A. Notes are given, all you have to do is fill in the blanks.",1
IF YOU LIKE YOUR LIFE AND VALUE YOUR TIME DO NOT EVEN LOOK AT THE NAME JOANNE HOUSTON.... THE SMALLEST MOST MICROSCOPIC THOUGHT OR CONSIDERATION OF TAKIN A CLASS WILL DESTROY THE LEFT SIDE OF YOUR BRAIN SHE FAILED 28 OUT OF 30 PPL IN MY CLASS...SHE IS ILLOGICAL AND CONFUSED WITH HER OWN LIFE MUCH LESS TO HAV TIME TO CATER TO YOURS..DON'T DO IT!!!!!,0
"Not by any means the easy class I expected going into an ""art appreciation"" class.  Teacher was very helpful on the 3+ page term paper you write.  Only way to not pass this class is to not try.  If you have an A when you finish off the regular class you don't take the final (which sounded downright terrifying if I had to take it)",1
"Like others have mentioned, the material itself is easy, but she made it really hard by giving a ridiculous amount of homework, with mandatory attendence of lectures, tutorials, and weekly quizzes. This is not high school, and learning should be independent at unviersity. Students should have right to decide which learning style best suits them",0
"Extremely knowledgeable of networking, and patient to all the various levels that come through his class. We did hands on while learning concepts, and then he built on, step by step, in a very organized way. His approach is much clearer than cisco material. Genuinely wants students to learn and do well in class, and later in job.",1
"Shes an amazing teacher, she knows how to answer any questions clearly for you to understand it. Shes great with explaining the concept if you get confused. She always lets you know if there is any difficulty in D2L. Please take her, if you want a GOOD grade, she is the one!!!",1
"amazing prof. SH has had a great impact on me personally. Interesting lectures and great reading materials. Yes, you actually have to do the work in this class, but you learn a LOT. almost all test Q's are discussed in class if you pay attention, so show up.",1
"She was kind of funny, but kind of offensive. Lectures are kind of long and then separate class with just your group is really easy if you have an easy GA. tests are incredibly difficult and even if you studied a lot, you still wouldn't necessarily well. Overall, not too bad. only 2 presentations throughout the semester, one individual, one group.",0
Devon is very passionate about poetry. Would not recommend if you are not as well. Very time consuming. The class atmosphere is very laid back.,1
"Do not take her if your lazy or a non-studyer because you will fail. If you study for the tests, do the online homework & quizzes, and do the 2 papers she assigns you then you're guaranteed to pass.",0
"Wonderful caring professor. It is art history, so prepare to study and memorize. Make your cards ASAP! I learned a lot and had fun doing it. You will get a lot out of this class if you are willing to put in the work. Don't just come to class unprepared and expect an easy A.",1
Dr. Nikkel is the best. No one ever has any problems with him in my class. He only asks that you get the basic understanding of the material and is understanding when you write your papers.,1
I took PSYC 321 (family development) with Dr. Mooney. She read straight off the slides and the class was boring. She was a tough grader when it came to the paper and exams. She nervously laughed after almost everything. Received a C and I worked my butt off in the class.,0
"Love his baritone voice, explains algorithms very well.",1
"Candida was a great teacher, she is very open and willing to work with her students. She assigned about 10 papers (1-2 pages each). There is a required 15 hour volunteer assignment, so make sure you make time. Class attendance is a good idea, this class wasn't one I wanted to miss. The content of the class was interesting and opened my mind.",1
"Dr. Malpass is almost impossible to work with. I was a junior taking a freshman level class, and I don't know how I passed. She does not give clear instructions or lectures. Her stories are probably the best part of the class.",0
"Nice guy. Shows he cares about the students. His slides however, are such a mess and he can't see to explain things well. He is clearly knowledgeable but can't convey anything. Homework and midterm/final preparation is easy, but the midterm and final themselves were way harder. Had to memorize how to solve q's rather than understanding the concepts",0
"Heavy reading and you have about 3 days to get it done  so DO NOT take any other classes with this one unless you dont have a job. We had to read  16-50 pages and watch an hours worth of videos then take a test on each, a quiz on the reading, and write 1000-1400 words total between 4 discussion responses. As a person with ADD this was impossible.",0
You can read about her under Last Name Yudes? But to describe her in one word ? HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!,0
She should be a kindergarden teacher...horrible at giving lectures.,0
"Extremely clear in the lect. You don't have to do any readings as long as you attend the lects. Funny and very Freudian (but I like Freud, so it's fine). On topic, on time, but leaves right when class ends. You can always ask questions in the middle of the lect if you don't get it. People who say he's difficult is because they don't bother to work.",1
"Professor Campbell seems like a nice person, but her grading is way too tough and rigid. She has one specific way of looking at things and grading, and she doesn't really appreciate or accept alternative ways of thinking. I've had her for a number of courses, and she assigns a lot of essays that are just regurgitation of lectures and the text.",0
absolutely amazing prof. best ive had in my 3 years so far. shes so passionate and knowledgeable about thermo that i wish i majored in cheme instead.,1
"I had Harry nearly 50 years ago when he was Bro Mushenheim. He was stoic and no-nonsense, hard nosed and dedicated. He expected students to think and hustle. I later taught at the university level and tailored my teaching to Mush's. I didn't care if 75% dropped out as long as the remaining students were better at math and logic at the end. THANKS",1
Sachdev rocks!!,1
"What a joke. it's like we are back in elementary school. She moves seats, makes you work with partners, and has every single person in the class repeat the same thing over and over again. Terrible teacher. Boring. She's so annoying. Tons of HW (Writing words 5x each) You never get out early even after taking a test. She's terrible. Worst teacher",0
"Lectures are really boring, but I would still recommend going. Weekly quizzes force you to stay up-to-date. The quizzes are straight from the HW. The concepts are difficult and I found my small section instructor (Ferrante) helping the most. You will need to study a lot for tests, they are not easy. A lot of partial credit is given on problems.",1
"You can pass the class however there is an excessive amount of reading and her quizzes are opinionated, unclear, and worth a lot of your grade. She is completely inflexible and has no consideration for her students. She teaches in a manner that outright contradicts what she is teaching.",0
Great professor but gives A LOT of work. You have reading assignments and informal writings due every class period. Participation is a good chunk of the grade and picks one or a few people always to call on. You learn a lot and gives you ample opportunities to extra credit. He is very knowledgeable about the subject he teaches.,1
He is a very tough grader and attendance is mandatory. Arriving a minute or two after class begins gives you an entire absence. His tests are easy if you study. If you are taking this class because you like Shakespeare be prepared to take in a lot of visual performances and analysis not only reading. You read about a play per 2 class periods.,0
"AMAZING PROFESSOR! By far the best Ive had, super patient and makes chem fun! Loved that class so much",1
if u mess up in the slightest bit she will not help u out. she is very rude and it seems like she wants you to fail. i took her class over the summer and had an A/B allll semester then because of a misunderstanding got a 0 on the final and she failed me. this woman had no sympathy and doesnt care about her students.,0
"If there was ever a person who was the definition of ""incomprehensible,"" it is this man.  Nothing makes sense.  Nothing.",0
Shes the most rude professor Ive ever had. She makes it hard to approach her outside of class because she will be unnecessarily rude to you and make you feel stupid. I simply asked to look at the grade sheet in an email which she rudely responded that she didnt understand why I didnt already see it. Her voice is monotone and uninteresting.,0
"Good course, good prof.  Nice guy, always has interesting anecdotes.  Assignments were fun (code breaking) and relatively easy once you got the idea.",1
"Balistreri is caring, and tries very hard to be a successful instructor, but unfortunately is not. Balistreri simply does not teach; she makes a powerpoint by copying and pasting from other sources, her powerpoints often contradict the textbooks, and reads us the powerpoints in a room for 3 hours. No interactivity. Lots of talk about nothing.",0
Took this class during the summer. He isn't so bad. He expects you to follow the rubric. Picking topics for the speeches was hard as he isn't really clear on what he wants. He gives good feedback and clarifies what you need to work on. There were 2 small assignments and 3 speeches. I did notice some awkward/inappropriate comments.,1
"Hard subject, but Dr. Polster is a great teacher.  Be prepared to do lots and lots printing, because there is no textbook.",1
"Professor Poole is absolutely amazing. Although she is a very difficult professor, she is always accessible to her students. If you are having trouble in class, go to office hours, as she is incredibly helpful and kind.",1
A very considerate teacher who cares about the expansion of national education. A wonderful teacher!,1
"the worst professor I have ever had after 4+ years studying philosophy. Totally unclear. Terrible slides, and unorganized lectures. He brought in SO MUCH useless jargon and useless diversions. It almost seemed like he was showing off how much he knew instead of teaching a course. His presentation of the categorical imperative was embarrassing!!!!!!",0
"Very confusing professor, he seems not able to teach this course. He is too careful. Does not inspire confidence, he makes serious mistakes. His tests are ridiculous. It is more of an undergraduate course,a total waste of time even if I did.",0
Oh boy. That Corson. I just want to eat him up with a spoon.,1
Ed has been one of the most difficult professors I have ever experienced. Throughout class I found myself extremely lost. Even after going to office hours I was still lost. The tests are unpredictable. Goes through topics quickly to end class early. Don't waste your time taking his course.,0
This is by far my favorite French class! Her classes are always entertaining and she has some REALLY funny stories! This class will also help you develop your French exponentially! We write stories -not papers- and there are weekly quizzes that are rather easy if you study for a few minutes. I would definitely recommend taking this class!,1
extremely arrogant and not helpful. has no shame in putting her students down.,0
Lectures & labs not  meaty  enough; intelligent and enthusiastic,1
I enjoyed the class and have learned a lot in reference to film and music.,1
"Dr. Pettice is a very smart professor and you are very lucky to have her as one. She always explains in depth and we experience ""real world journalism"" but her class is quite difficult.",1
"He knows his stuff, but is terrible at teaching it",0
"Quickly, I haven't much time. His first name is J-",1
I took Creative Writing in the 1980s with W - She was wonderfully inspirational with an incisive mind and a transparently compassionate heart.,1
"Great prof, very interesting lectures, the assignments are really annoying but doable (two 2-3 page essays about readings). Midterm is all by-heart but its really clear, final exam is open book but still complicated. Overall, really great and interesting! PS: only buy the course pack with the articles, the little novel is useless (never used it).",1
"Good professor, helpful, accessible and generally cares about you. Go to the office hours like the other student said. Tests and quizzes are straight off text / class - but you have to do the work - but you'll learn a lot. Prof is pretty cool actually.  Class is recommended and prof is good overall...",1
"Wey Leong is a nice human. However, his inability to empathize with students struggling to pass the course makes him a terrible professor. His midterms and tests are way too difficult and further worsened by his egregious marking. The project tho ughinteresting, was conducted on buggy software and also marked harshly.",0
"I had her for Crim Law and it was a great Class. Professor had an expansive knowledge of the material and made it a pleasure to come to class. Material prepares you well for her exam, if you study you will be fine. There are no surprises with her. ",1
Does not clarify the work that he puts out and always goes off topic. Talks down to his students like they're dumb and expects everybody to be on the same page without putting concrete guidelines on paper or online. Do not,0
"I took him over the summer for quant methods - a lot easier than the other prof's that teach this, extremely helpful - he wants his students to do well and makes them start to think about math for themselves and to use common sense when solving problems...Just put in a little effort and you'll def walk away with an A",1
"He's really boring. Very slow too, talks about like 3 pages per lecture. Then rushes at the end where the tested material is located. Not the greatest in organization ",0
"Seems like a bright and nice guy but not really much of a teacher, to be honest; focused on telling you what to think than teaching you how to think. Tends to favor a handful and is condescending to the rest (I was one of the handful, but it's embarrassing). Doesn't actually seem to like teaching or his students much, which might be why he's chair.",0
"Her lectures where basically just a brief summary of the textbook, and unless otherwise specified pretty much not worth studying. I focused on summarizing each textbook chapter that was assigned and reviewed the notes several times and I did well. Go to the supplemental instruction meetings!!! They help clarify and are good review! I liked her tho!",1
"Definitely knows her stuff, but you might not. She covers a lot of stuff that isn't documented in your book or online, so you'll have to pay attention and take notes (quickly... she can move fast). Beware javadocs, and expect to adhere to a specific style of programming (very tedious).",1
"I have always been a straight A student, and I wish I would've found the website before taking this class. Currently, I am in HIS1112 with Dr. Crews. He provides no help, ridiculous midterm and final, no study guides or preparation. This was my very first college class and thought it was going to be the death of me.",0
This class is extremely difficult so if you want to do well you have to put in the time and effort. I would highly recommend going to the tutors if you are struggling. And try not the leave the homework to the last minute because it can take awhile.,0
"I love her. If you show up to class and learn you will have a great time. She is super sweet and cares about her students. In Bi 121 Lab she does grade on spelling, but that is a good thing. It makes you better.",1
Honestly the best professor I have ever had. Even though I didn't get a great grade in the class (due to the labs) I loved his lecture he's an amazing person with an amazing story,1
Great professor. I learned a ton from him. He is very funny in lecture (not required but definitely need to go to pass) and he really cares about his students. His tests are very difficult-if you have previous tests they are very good to study from. Make friends to study with and you'll be fine. Would recommend Dr. Crawford any day. He's the best.,1
"If you are not a healthcare management and policy major and have the option of having this professor, DO NOT DO IT. She is the absolute WORST. She REFUSED to give out any ""S""'s for her hc finance class, even though most professors would grant the S option if requested. She is an entitled and does not truly care about her students.",0
"Compared to Easton- Tyler is awesome. Compared to Larson he isnt the best. Tyler's class is laid back,all you do is listen to him lecture about the slides. Assignments and homework are fairly easy. If you really want to learn things clearly & directly from lecture take Larson, for an easy class based on slides take Tyler - SUPER nice guy!",1
"Dr. Harvey was the *first* person that made stats click with me, and thats after STAT185 and RMI. His instruction leaves for zero grey area/confusion, as he if very thorough and makes sure 100% of his classroom is understanding everything. This means that if you have a question, don't be afraid to pipe up! He's wonderful professor, TAKE HIS CLASS!!",1
"Beery is well versed in journalism, for sure. However, his teaching style is a little past its prime. He tends to ramble and gets off topic. His grading is tough and he will often get assignments back to you after you've already turned in another paper just like it. Pretty rough class.",0
"I took this class to fulfill a requirement. Did not expect much. Not really interested in politics, but the class fit my schedule and I had heard good things. Glad I took the class. Gave me a whole new perspective on politics and really kept my interest. I really liked all the current articles he sent students to illustrate course material",1
i didnt feel like i got my moneys worth,0
I took this class online with a full schedule and it was very doable. Her lectures are super interesting and she makes it easy for non-majors to understand the material. There are 4 exams and one fairly easy assignment. She drops the lowest exam grade that isn't the final. I definitely recommend this class if you need to fulfill a GE requirement.,1
"I have always hated math and almost failed every math class I've ever taken. Angelica is the best professor I've had to date in my college career, between 2 different college's. She cares about her students deeply, and will always stay after to answer extra questions. She makes sure you fully understand the material before moving on. Take her class",1
"My favorite professor yet! She was super clear with every assignment, was always willing to help you if you ask for it, and made sure you understood the material. Definitely buy the textbook, you will need it for the exams. I would definitely take another class with her!",1
"I hate this class. Group work, forced class discussion, and a lot of homework.",0
"Honestly a really good guy. He seems like he wants you to do good, and even gave my class a 10 point curve on the 1st test as a lot of people didn't do so well. Personally, though, his lectures are lacking. You need to read the textbook thoroughly in order to do well at all. He gives 50 question multiple choice quizzes, and they aren't easy.",1
"Higley is funny and amusing, but she is also very insulting. In both of my papers she would write rude demeaning comments. I disagreed with her once in class and since that point she has consistently called my points ""wrong"" no matter what I argue. Her essay prompts are extremely vague. Get a different teacher.",0
"Excellent prof. Works at a slow,  thorough speed, but not annoyingly so. Assignments and final were fair, midterm was crazy easy. Lots of bonus questions for credit on assignments if that's your kind of thing. Only criticism is sometimes it felt like he prepped his lecture 20 minutes before starting and was figuring stuff out along with you.",1
"Accent did not bother me, I could figure out what he was saying. He is very nice and cares about students. However, I found his class to be VERY unorganized. Blackboard is all over the place, lectures didnt stay on topic and he would say he sent out emails that I have no record of receiving. Its doable but not enjoyable.",1
"Very funny teacher.  Makes work fun,  the way it should be.  Excellent lectures.  He is always willing to help you out.",1
Can not explain text in a why that is easily understood. Just repeats the text.,0
"I love Dr. Malpass, she is an amazing teacher and really knows what she's talking about! She is soft spoken so make sure you sit up front. My only complaint is that she is a VERY tough grader.",1
"I would not advise beginners or students without prior experience, not CIS6 class assignments, to programming take his class. Lectures and lab assignments were ok, however h.w. and exam were very tough. Grading is 90% from exam while 10% h.w. Not a great teacher for beginners! Disappointed and sad for taking his class!",0
"Dr Day is a great lecturer, even though he says ""in terms of"" at the end of his sentences. Some of the quiz/exam questions are ambiguous, try not to read too much into them. He gives lots of opportunities to make up marks by dropping lowest exam and quiz scores and giving bonus questions. Entertaining lectures.",1
"Professor Neff is a great man. I could tell that he really wanted to connect with his students through lectures and office hours. He was so helpful to me when it came to writing a paper. Lecture drags a bit and I can't say I learned a ton, but that's how most IH classes are here.",1
"I constantly didn't know what was happening in Hawker's class. Essentially you go to class because he loves to hear his own voice. His slides are useless and he shows a lot of YouTube & movie clips, so make sure you bring your caffeine. The tests are never over what he talks about in class, only over the case examples in the textbook.",0
"Dudrick is easily my favorite professor so far. He's so chill and funny, and extremely smart but not intimidating. The material can be confusing but he does a great job of helping students understand. His tests are pretty straightforward as long as you do the reading, attend class and take notes. I REALLY recommend him for any philosophy course. ",1
"Great professor, funny, interesting, great readings and lectures",1
"Rude. Interrupts students while they are presenting & tells them they are wrong (how embarrassing for them). Never clear with what she wants, will mark you down for things she claims she said was required but never did. Call her out on something, she will become a total B. Such a BORING lecture, tells lame stories, explains pointless things. SUCKS.",0
One of the best professors Ive taken at Penn State. Dont miss class and do your assignments and youll pass. Also he lets you bring a sheet off paper of handwritten notes for the exam.,1
"Assignments were easy overall. However, at the end of the semester, he changed his grade breakdown from what the syllabus originally said. His grading was really inconsistent and many students received grades lower than they actually earned. I would avoid this professor for this class.",0
"Incredible professor. Without question, deserves national attention for quality of teaching.",1
Extremely tough grader. Takes off 10% on each paper you make more than three different grammar mistakes. Searches to find issues with your grammar. Nice lady but too focused on grammar.,0
I would take a chance on another teacher. She doesnt respond to emails in a timely manner and rarely gives any positive feedback. She does not give clear explanations and sometimes rude to students on the discussion boards. She offered no insights or tips during her weekly videos and read word for word the assignments for the upcoming week.,0
worst teacher at the university.  you can be a GREAT student in EVERY class but he will change things.  he does not care about his students...he had a 4.0 in college and thinks that he is better then everyone.  is NOT usefull during class or office hours.  the book is helpful but forget it when it comes to exams...good luck,0
"DO NOT TAKE HER!  She plays clear favorites in class and good luck if you want to get an A.  Even when you do everything she says it takes to get an A on a paper, its still impossible to get one!  Some people dont even get a grade, they get a ""see me."" If you want an A, take someone else!!!",0
"Paszek is genuinely a good professor if you love lectures. Make sure you take extremely good notes and READ THE TEXTBOOK. You need to know terms and put those terms into context for tests. There is one big paper at the end of the term and an EC with it so do both, start early. Use Vital Source for the textbook to save $ and is helpful for the paper",1
"Class was two days a week for an hour and fifteen and he assigns readings for every class period with a clicker question for the reading. I never read because it was too much and just guessed/looked up the clicker question. Never listened to lecture eithe PRO: There is no tests, only one term paper at the end! and a couple homework/outside videos.",0
Barry is a good guy-tries to be too inspirational. Do HW and do it well b/c counts a ton of your grade. Each exam is like 9% so not much of  your grade. He gives a ton of extra credit! HW once a week. Do well on your labs. 3 exams and one final (was optional my year). Lectures are boring but its physics. He gives a practice exam before each exam!,1
"Wonderful, engaging and very encouraging.",1
He was down to earth,1
"He is a good band director, but keep in mind I am not a music major. For someone just taking the class for fun, he's great - gives a lot of anecdotes and examples relating to kissing, not sure if that's a flavor of the year thing or not. He talks to the music ed majors a lot, telling them things that will be helpful to them. Fun class.",1
awesome person. really tries to explain and you can tell she has a passion for what she is teaching. i really really love her class. TAKE HER,1
if you are looking to take this class in the spring or any time in your life please dont. heres why This professor at first might appear nice and warm and funny but she is far from it. the aleks program she uses has no mercy when it comes to grading. take another professor. i spent 24+ hours on one hw which is far too much when u have others,0
"I think if I took the classroom version of this course it would have been more engaging.  There was constant trouble with the online set-up, but Grillo was fair in his grading and lenient with dates; however, I think he would be much more engaging in a classroom setting.",1
Worst professor ever. Not funny. Full of himself. Too much material for a 100 level class.,0
"The class isn't that bad but it'll put you to sleep. She speaks very slowly about very boring things. There are a ton of quizzes over really boring readings but she's a nice professor, if a bit long winded. ",1
"Would not recommend this class to any upperclassman just fulfilling their grad requirements. Method of grading is completely subjective w/ no rubric attached to any assignments. Feedback is vague and not helpful. Spent 5 hours on one assignment and got 70% and 30 minutes on another and got 100%, inconsistency in grading speaks for itself.",0
amazing prof -- puns leave you rolling on the ground laughing and almost peeing your pants,1
"Truly amazing! Crypto is a really hard course but his explanation made everything clear. Slides were really concise yet informative. Exams were fair, only the core concepts were tested. Talks a bit too fast. Writings on the board were neat and clear. Assignments were very useful. Replies very diligently on Piazza. Need to post blackboard notes tho.",1
Very knowledable professor and has a great sense of humour. However he is very picky about marking and if you dont give your 100% then you have a high chance of getting a really low mark or even failing. The group project is really comprehensive and will suck up most of your time. Exam and midterm are really difficult and heavy on keywords.,1
You don't need the book. Just google the graphs and save your money. Don't rely on him answering your emails. He grades hard at the beginning of the semester than it gets easier as the semester goes on.,0
"English major here, Stanbury was my sophomore year crawpoetry prof. she is very liberal, which was nice as basically any idea, (ANY) idea you threw out there about poem analysis was usually creditable in some way during in-class discussion.  She is a very difficult grader which is in stark contrast to her liberal views, good luck to the gents ;  )",0
"Funny prof that tries to have a demonstration every class which kept the class interesting. However, his board notes are disorganized so you have to make sure to take notes on your own. His examples are a bit too easy and don't help much on assignments. Other than that, his explanations and lectures are pretty clear. Overall, good prof.",1
"Prof. Thompson is super kind, caring and approachable. So glad I took his class. He's accessible during office hours and helps you figure out how to get the grade you want based on your scores. Lectures are worth your time and exams are fair. Also, do the extra credit opportunity! If you put in the time, you will do well.",1
"I made an A in this class simply because the exams were departmental, and they were much easier than the work we did in class. He is a really nice guy who is willing to help, but he is just not a good teacher. He made things so much harder than they had to be in class, and he confused me more than he helped.",0
"I truly enjoyed this course and having Mrs. McGlynn as my professor.  She cares about what she does and is happy to help.  She infuses meaning into what she teaches and has inspired me as a future educator.  If you have the opportunity to take a class with her, please do.  She is a gem!",1
"This class is an easy A as long as you keep up with the readings and complete the assignments. She isn't a tough grader. The subject matter is interesting and relevant to the border region, but the class materials are extremely dated. The professor speaks during the entire class and students aren't given the opportunity to engage with the material.",1
"This class was extremely boring. Took it for an easy elective, and got a good grade but worked hard for it. A lot of assignments and a lot of busy, unnecessary work that isnt hard but takes a long time. Test are easy and the project is too. No final. Her voice is so monotone, I fell asleep in almost every class. Takes attendance. ",0
Professor Teng was not a good professor for fundamentals of programming. You are better off using stack overflow and watching youtube videos than going to class. He uses poor examples that are very complex when introducing new topics. You'll have no idea what to study for when it comes to tests and he never would go over homework. Good,0
"Dr. Lunsford is definitely one of the best professors at UNC Charlotte. True, his assignments are difficult and he grades harshly, but if you show that you care and meet with him to ask questions, then you will get the most out of the class. He is wonderful and gracious and I would love to take another class with him.",1
Nash is a great professor! She really enjoys teaching and encourages people to participate even though most of the class just sat there and stared into oblivion. Just do the study guides and you'll do fine on the tests. research paper was graded easily.,1
"Doesnt teach much. Assigns ridiculous amounts of reading and then spends the whole class talking about them. extremely tough grader and although she tries to be fair on her tests, they are still very challenging.  She is very nice, though, and always enthusiastic. however, i would never take this class again and this class made me rethink my major.",0
"She is nice but doesn't seem very helpful. In my opinion, she doesn't explain things very clearly. There were many times in class where she would call on students for answers, they didn't know the answer, and then kind of acted like we were stupid for not knowing even though it was her instructions that weren't clear/didn't make sense.",0
"Unrealistic expectations for intermediate German. Does not teach, just assigns an obscene amount of weekly homework that does not help on tests (or learning for that matter). Class focuses on diagramming sentences instead of learning to speak and read German. She is out to get everyone. Hated it. Withdrew. Choose a different language.",0
"He is one of the most boring people i have ever met. He does not teach, but rereads material that was meant for the previous nights homework. Although we learn nothing somehow the class always end up going over the time limit. He also has a semi mullet which can be both a plus and a negative. It gives you something to look as whenfeeling suicidal",0
"Professor Shearer is really nice, although he has a sarcastic sense of humor. You can tell he is really passionate about history since he has traveled a lot around Europe. He gets really into the subject though, so you are better off typing your notes although writing them is still possible. Overall, great class and I would take him again.",1
He sucks.The class is terribly hard.,0
"In his class you will read chapter books about the environment. You will have chapters assigned for each class). There are quizzes each class about those chapters. Not that difficult, based on main points of the chapter. You have to write summaries on the chapters. Class was interesting and I enjoyed it. Did not have to take notes.",1
The best teacher at Grossmont. We are ending the semester having learned something about everyone in the class. He wants nothing more than to see you succeed. Not textbook either. Show up and be polite. That is it.,1
Amazing!!! My absolute favorite professor EVER. I wish he could teach me all my courses! He is entertaining and teaches you tons of material without you even realizing it. His office hours were very helpful as well. 12/10 would recommend,1
Best professor at Bowdoin.,1
Nice guy but horrible class. His grading system is ridiculous! Lectures are a bore. Would not recommend..,0
I really Loved Dr. Narby. He was the best teacher I have ever had. He is really helpful. But his test are hard! Read the text book! If psychology is your major he truly helps you to realize if you belong in that field!,1
"Hudson's quizzes & exams were basically all multiple choice. He rambles a lot! I struggled to stay focused. His videos can be interesting, & he does make some good jokes on occasion. This is a very easy class if you can teach yourself from the readings, yet he is fairly knowledgeable with certain areas of anthropology.",0
Professor Lorentz is the best! He will proofread essays before due dates and will specify exactly what needs to be changed for an A and he is very understanding. He really cares and is very clear and timely on his grading. He lectures a lot but often takes time for more fun assignments. Professor Lorentz is an amazing professor.,1
"Biggest joke at McMaster. The man does not even know how to make a website, yet grades students on their skills. I consistently wonder where he found his degrees",0
"Communicates horribly!! Terrible explaining stuff, and requires a lot of work. Not understanding. I did not enjoy her class at all.",0
"Guido is a legend, this is what a professor should be! Extremely organized, clear grading structure, hands-on lectures. Even when classes got moved online, he adjusted without missing a beat. The last group quiz got turned into an assignment after we told him we were having trouble. He's even great to talk to outside of class too!",1
"I hate this course to be honest. The final project is hard and completely clueless. he never taught simulations or writing essays in class and he expects us to come up with our own paper on topics that is related to the materials but not taught by him. Also for the midterm, a lot of the solutions can not be found in his notes.",0
"Gotta love her shoes at least, I think she is okay-however I can see how  sometimes people might think she has favorites, because well, she does.  But as long as you make an effort to go and talk to her she is a very understanding and well educated woman who loves Auburn, hey she's one of the only ones in the dept. who actually went there.",1
"Your entire grade is based on midterm and final tests (aside from research credit), and tests are almost all based on textbook readings. You can get by in the course by never going to class and reading the textbook. When I did go to class, he was very knowledgable and well-versed on the content. Lectures did not help me do better on midterms.",1
Great teacher!!! You can def get an A! Be sure to go to every lab!!!,1
Bunch of busy work so much effort required for basic grades. Way too cheerful. Definitely has favorites.,0
"had her 3 times would take again, ended the sem. with over 20 extra pionts to my final grade meaning that i could have failed the final and the midterm and still pulled an a. I spent all of 3 hours outside the class each sem. Got all A, and learned a lot of relevent info. She also knows a lot, so if you have any leagel questions shes got answers.",1
He was very hard. Only take him if you are prepared to do the work!,0
classes worth getting up to go to,1
Elle fait des PowerPoint trÃ¨s clairs et explique bien la matiÃ¨re. Je n'ai pas du tout lu le livre de la session parce que ses ppt sont trÃ¨s complets. C'est mieux d'Ãªtre prÃ©sent en classe pour comprendre. MatiÃ¨re semble compliquÃ©e Ã  priori mais c'est en fait trÃ¨s simple si on suit bien en classe. Pas trÃ¨s dynamique ni captivante mais explique bien.,1
"Loved Professor Khoury. He was great all around. Wanted the best for his students and did everything he could to help them. Even though the class was asynchronous, he would frequently schedule zoom meetings to answer questions and go over the essentials. Tests are really easy compared to hw which is pretty tough to ensure comprehension.",1
"Mr. Alexandrov constantly gives pointless lectures, doesn't know how to function a laptop constantly needs one of the students to help him, he's like my grandpa trying to use his flip phone.",0
"I am pursuing an engineering degree. Taking this course has made me rethink my career choice. This professor has been truly inspirational. Never in my life I imagined I would enjoy a law course, ever. Dr. Bowal is definitely not the kind of prof to give away grades to students (may be that is why he has some bad reviews). But he is fair to the core",1
"This was the most boring lecture and I eventually stopped attending. If you show up for the lab portion and do the online homework on your own, you should get an easy A. This was a very easy class but required a lot of time doing online work. I think Jerry was a very smart prof, but he had a hard time dumbing it down to our level. ",1
I really did not like this class. It fulfilled a breadth requirement but was worse than all my other classes.,0
"Despite the long 2 1/2 hour long lecture period, I found myself attentively paying attention and that was simply due to how well Narayan is able to teach. Homework isn't a problem if you attend class and take notes and tests aren't a problem if you do the homework. Overall, a very good learning experience. ",1
"Huey is a great professor that understands how challenging being a student can be and doesn't make his class any harder than it needs to be. His lectures are interesting and he is entertaining. His exams are open note and open book, so if you go to class and take good notes the exams are not hard.",1
"Very condescending. He would talk down and be rude if you didn't understand the question. I never had this problem, but I witnessed it very often with other students in my class.",0
Very sarcastic and rude,0
"Dr. Roberto's class was very informative. I always entered his class ready to learn because his discussions were so interesting.  Although you're grade is only based on 4 tests and a final, the tests were not too difficult since they were done online and were open-notes.  Overall, great class.",1
Possibly the worst class.  She has the most strict attendance policy so that you can sit in class and have her read you the book.  I have other ways of WASTING an hour and 15 min.  I highly recommend looking elsewhere for a mktg prof.  Take Turner instead,0
"Worst teacher I have ever had.  She has no grip on reality but teaches one of the few classes in law school that supposedly teaches real world lawyering.    Do yourself a favor and take fundamental lawyering with another professor.  If you get stuck with this one, do not buy the book it is a complete waste of money.",0
"Wonderful professor. Extremely helpful and clear when talking. He makes a lot of great jokes, which makes class fun. Would take another course taught by him in a second.",1
I havnt even finished the semester and I cannot stand this class.  He is the worst professor I have ever seen.  The class is pretty much him reading off of the powepoints and pointless tests that test for nothing that we have learned...NEVER TAKE THIS CLASS FROM THIS PROFESSOR HE IS HORRIBLE!,0
"Not a good prof.  Software abstraction is easy to understand yet he made it sound really hard and confusing.  He confused me and even himself, but lucky that this is an easy course so you don't need him to pass!",0
"If you have the choice, donot take Athanas. She is absolutely atrocious. She doesn't give a damn about her students. Every other lecture is just her yelling at her students telling them how bad they are and how if you don't do things her way she will take off points. Overall, if you have any self respect, don't take her!!!",0
Great easy class but must be disciplined,1
"Truly among the worst that Grand Valley has to offer. Do NOT take him for any classes, but certainly not a foundational course like 162. If you get stuck with him, be ready to rely on the textbook and external resources because he rambles, gets confused, and legitimately does not understand how to use a computer. Awful, awful professor.",0
Her hybrid lectures were not different than what was posted online. Frustrating because she would just show the same videos and a very surface/basic outline of the chapter in actual class time that was already online. Also the essay citations must be within 5 years and that was not clearly communicated. Which left an excessive point reduction.,0
"Did not like him as a professor. Took ECMB11 course with him, and he decided to use a past FINAL exam for our second mid-term. I felt that doing this was un-fair. His notes are messy, hard to understand and using the textbook is absolutely useless.",0
"First day of class then dropped out. Discussion heavy, heavy reading, expect to write  3-4 pages of reflection papers. BEWARE",0
"is this the right professor that everyone is giving good reviews about??? She is horrible. her tests are hard, she grades hard, she is not willing to help when needed, she barely knows what she is teaching. I tried in her class, still did bad. She's rude and very unproffessional. my advice, take the class with someone else.",0
very strong accent. very hard to understand.  I didn't learn anything in this class.  He teaches stuff that should be common sense to most people.  If you know  how to use a computer this class should be easy for you.  He gives out multiple choice tests which arent too bad.  pretty boring lectures.   Veryyy easy to pass class just do all the work!,0
Dana is a great ASL teacher. Many students are hesitant when they find out they will have a deaf instructor but she is very patient and easy to understand. As long as you do all of your workbook assignments (which take 20 mins typically) you will do very well in the class. Love it!,1
"Not a very good teacher. Gives long lectures that have almost no correlation to the tests. He will spend the whole lecture teaching about one simple detail instead of covering the whole chapter. The only way to get a good grade in this class is to read and teach yourself. Oh, and the final test, its a trap; he purposely made the test super hard.",0
Extensive knowledge of American history and the voice of a radio host leave Russ' lecturing ability unparalleled. He clearly cares about both the subject he teaches and the success of his students. He is also very friendly so feel free to ask for help.,1
"Professor Bellantoni makes all of lectures extremely interesting. The two midterms are very easy, and the paper you have to write is not too bad.",1
THIS WAS THE MOST BORING CLASS EVER!! NEVER TAKE IT UNLESS YOU WANT TO FALL ASLEEP!!,0
"Confusing! It seems like she is making things up on the fly. Grading is all over the place, no consistency.  I'm sure she is nice, but I would try to take the course from someone else.",0
"Bonnie is great. Her journalism class is intense and a lot of work. She really is a great woman and LOVES her job. If you have a serious interest in journalism, or want to learn to become a better writer, TAKE HER. This is not an easy A. She said she rarely gives A's. I got a B. I absolutely loved her.",1
"Excellent class.  Shartin is on top of his game, and if you allow yourself to get into the subject matter, you'll find your methods of thought changing.  Philosophy is difficult for some, but the professors at WSC make it much easier.  Shartin is no exception.  Take his classes.",1
"This professor is not suited to teach. He rambles on and on during class and hardly touches the VERY SPECIFIC information needed for the test. His tests consist of 10 essay questions, that are asked in the most obsure and misleading language. You will not get a good score unless you rely on only the textbook to teach you everything for this course.",0
"Dr Banerjee excels in the area of research and authoring books However students must take into consideration the fact that this course may be the hardest course they take in the sense the notes are vague and largely copy-paste of the book to be accurate As a polite comment, Dr Banerjee should spend more time on voice over pp and write clearer notes",0
"I do not recommend taking a class with Dr. Sun. More than half of my class withdrew because it was so difficult. I had taken a calculus class before this one and that's the only reason I got a good grade. My test grades plummeted as soon as we got into material I hadn't done before. He's very confusing, even to someone who knew the material before.",0
"Eves is a good professor. Class is pretty easy as well. As long as you take notes on the power points, you should be fine. He's nice, and he knows what he teaches. If you miss class though, you miss a lot of information, so it's best to go.",1
Don't miss your chance to have one of IU's best professors. You will laugh and learn. Review study guides and you'll be fine.,1
Great Professor. Just pay attention to the interesting lectures and read the book to get an A. Objective grading (just get a total score of 400 with all tests and homework for the A). Funny and fair with lots of extra credit. Would take again.,1
She needs to be given a raise,1
"If I could take Killian again I ABSOLUTELY would. He really cares about his students and whether or not they are learning. His lectures are fun and easy to understand, just make sure you take good notes! If you have any questions his is available and loves to help!",1
"Gabbin is NOT that bad. He is extremely entertaining, & he cares about his students. His class is not that hard. It's intermediate 2, you have to read the textbook. Read the chapters and just study the problems he does in class. Do the CPA chapter problems bc they are the basis of his MC on exams. Class is very entertaining. Don't be scared.",1
"I have no talent going into this class and so I expected to learn HOW to do things, as it turns out I just paid hundreds of dollars to PRACTICE drawing in class. I understand that practice is important but I could just as easily practice drawing at home and save money.  He was less than clear most of the time and I hardly learned to draw better.",0
It is usually difficult for her to articulate exactly what she wants you to work on. She is caring and personable.,1
good ,1
"Bozorgi may be the easiest professor Ive had at OU. I took him for architecture for non-majors to knock out an upper division elective. Attendance is a large percentage of your grade, and weekly papers are casually graded by his TAs. Pretty much if you show up and do your weekly paper youll get an A. No tests at all, final is 7 page paper.",0
Great and funny prof. Interesting with a good sense of humor. Though really hard!,1
"rude, careless, unhelpful, seems lost. I mean, he is the only prof for CORP FINANCE and there is a huge waiting list for the online version of this class which explains a lot.",0
Worst teacher at Alma I have had. Boring! How did he get a doctorate in anything unless it was a subject for the stupidest people in college? Tests and quizzes are either too easy or too hard. He is here for the money not for students.,0
"tells lots of great stories, would recommend going to class",1
"Bob is one of the best professors I have had so far. Not only does he do his best to help students, he does his best to focus on craft elements instead of personal taste when grading. His workshops are not based upon perfection, but rather attempting to master craft and the creation of story. He always tried to make the class more informative.",1
"Textbook was mad expensive, homework assignments were a time suck but not difficult in the least. The amount of studying for the exam does not correlate at all with your grade. Final exam is killer, which requires way too much memorization. This class is no longer an Easy A, do not take it if you have heard that it was.",0
"good prof, he is not easy but very understanding and helpful. good looking",1
"I've taken two METEO classes at PSU. The other with a different prof I got an A in, and with this one I got a C. Prof Babb is as unhelpful as the convoluted material he presents, all of which does very little to prepare you for the assignments. If you need help, he just vaguely refers you back to the material. Not just difficult, but unfair.",0
"Funny, understanding and a very motivating instructor. I  am taking a second class with him this Semester!",1
"Katrina never answers emails back until a day or two later, and when she does it is a one-word email. I asked her what to do to receive a good grade and she told me that I was doing fine even though I was not. Do not take her PSY 250 class online it is terrible!",0
"Although you learn some cool technology uses, the environment in the classroom was awful. He'll constantly go off topic on things unrelated to class making the class feel longer than it already is. He constantly yells, get frustrated and impatient to any student wanting to ask questions or clarification and overall an unpleasant person. STAY AWAY!",0
Good individual and prof given a really sucky class to teach. The class covers an intro to SAP and consists of all dreadfully boring powerpoints. The content level is comparable to an online class for 7th graders. Do not buy the book. You will never have to study for exams. Just show up and do the hw- easy A if you can make it to class. ,1
"I am not going to lie this class it tough if you are looking for an easy A. However, effort and work does pay out in the end. She is a tough grader on the grammar portion of the class but it very understanding with the oral parts.  Overall was a fun relaxed, and laid back class.",1
"DJB is the best! If you have to take ACC 311, TAKE HER! She's hands down my favorite professor at UT, would take her again if I could. The material is challenging but she truly cares about her students so if you're struggling go to office hours. She's super sweet and approachable.",1
"Takes attendance every class and writes very quickly on the black board so be prepared to have multiple pages of notes every lecture. He is very soft spoken and monotonic, review the hw and in class examples to pass.",0
Professor Bambach is the hardest professor I have had (I'm a senior) for a course that should not be. The material seems practical and interesting but his exams are completely conceptual. You memorized all of your notes? It won't help you. I have never rated a prof but I thought this was necessary. Do NOT take him for 471. Extremely disappointed.,0
"He's a good guy, but not my favorite professor. He makes attendance worth a test grade (plus some extra) which is nice if you go to every class, but his lectures aren't very helpful. I and most of the people I know in this class only learned from the book. So definitely buy the book.",0
His class is passable but you have to actually try. HIs lectures are brief and you barely take away anything. The bulk of the learning is form the in class assignments which help alot in understating the ppt lectures. Online Hw can be time consuming at times. Test are challenging but does allow a cheat sheet.,1
"I took CJSA 2323, Book is MANDATORY about 60$ from campus library. If you don;t get the book you will NOT pass, all assignment questions come straight from book. Easiest A ever. All exams and quizzes are open on the first day of class and You have until the last day of class to finish all material.",1
"Not a very helpful professor. She may be funny sometimes and enthusiastic about her topics, but when it comes to student's opinions, she is not very open. Assignments were not clear and feedback was not helpful at all. ",0
Great teacher when he shows up to class prepared. Love his class but feel like sometimes we don't really talk about anything. Not very clear with his expectations but sure knows his stuff.,1
"VERY DIFFICULT! This class is solely based off test, no other assignments to help your grade. You take 7 test and your final course grade is based off of 5/7. If you do bad on the test (you probably will) you may take the final and try to improve you score (which wont even help) READ YOUR BOOK because you basically teach yourself. BAD PROFFESSOR!!!",0
Does not cover some course material in class or in his notes. If you don't have the textbook you won't know about this material and it will likely come up in an assignment or exam as a surprise to you.,0
"Professor Rogoff is a very interesting professor in that she can be sweet, genuine, and good at teaching about the world of business, but the class itself can get easily boring and she does have a temper when it comes to cell phones. Do the work and show up to class and you'll do well. Hopefully.",1
"Please take with any other professor available for course. Personally spent anywhere between 15-30 a week outside of class time studying and it is not enough. Tests are extremely hard and ""tricky"". Also, class time was ineffective because he does not follow book. If he does, I could not make the connection.",0
"ECE 241 is a hard class for many, but Day does a great job of teaching it. He explains material very well in class and frequently gives examples of when the material we're learning about is used in the real world. He is very friendly, and always happy to help during his office hours. I wish he taught more classes!",1
"Summed up in one word... Boring... but I had to take it.  attendance is one of those things were it was mandatory because it was a night class, but we were always done at 7:30pm. Do the worksheets cuz thats your only hope for points. The class averages on the first two test for us were 62% and then 60%. Final yet to come... Ill get a ""B"" overall th",1
"Very intelligent prof! He is very helpful if you do not fully understand something (which happens often in Ethics) He is rather funny at times too! His tests are challenging but if you know the material well and can understand his advanced english in the questions you will do just fine! Lastly, Google him and the Wall Street Journal :)",1
Online class.  Must stay on top of work.,1
"Self-taught class! He does provide good review sessions for the exams prior so take good notes those periods. 2 quizzes, 3 exams, and a project. Tends to give out high marks for the projects and lenient/sensitive to students' issues such as emergencies! More than willing to accommodate. Class some days can drag on. Attendance not a really factor,",1
Awesome prof. Awesome class. Dedicated prof who goes out of her way to help.,1
Recommend,1
Just read off the PowerPoint doesnt make his own PowerPoint uses the book so get ready to not need over half of it but he wont make his own so you really have no idea what youre studying at home. Just lectures youre not interacting with a 3 1/2 hours at all. For someone who has a learning disability get ready to be very challenged. NSCC,0
Its true he often goes off topic but he is still very intresting no matter what he is talking about. However i still learned alot about the subject. he was very reasonable and an easy grader except when it came to papers. i hope you are better at gramar than i was.,1
"Ron seems like a genuinely kind man. He sends positive canvas announcements out telling students to enjoy their weekends. He has some funny stories, but on the whole I just don't feel that he's a skilled instructor. His class feels dry and insubstantial. I am obsessed with criminology and the criminal justice system, but he lost me. Sorry, Ron.",0
"Meh. He seems bored and unengaged during most lectures. We are all tired of zoom, we all are in the same boat.... we also don't pay to listen to instructors complain about not being able to do research. Nice enough guy (mostly)!! VERY SMART!! Just seems like he can't really be ""bothered"" with first/second-year courses. Does seem willing to help!",1
"She deducts points fast!  I wish she inspired me and all the other students in class.  Even though I passed with an A, I would recommend any other student to take another instructor.",0
"The man is all over the place!  I've had instructors before that you can tell they feel it's beneath them to be forced to teach at a community college level.  I get that vibe from him.  Condescending.  His quizzes are easy if you listen to 10% of what he says.  The rest of it is just talking to hear himself talk, I think.",0
Just ok.....,0
"does not give any extra credit, many failed her class, does not grade homework!! Gives two take home quizzes.",0
"She was always very vague about what she wanted. She expected you to use canvas a lot and from what I could remember would never give you a heads up with something was coming up, I understand that it's our responsibility, but Eng101 is one of the 1st classes you take in college and I didn't know how to use it right away. A heads up would've been n",0
"As obviously smart as David is, he is a terrible prof. His lectures are all over the place and completely disorganized. His voice is monotonous and he mumbles to himself a lot - it's incredibly difficult to pay attention to.",0
"I enjoyed the lectures and the prof's sense of humor.  Sometimes I thought lectures were a bit too easy for an advanced course, but overall the pace of the course was good.  I would have liked more homework so I could have more feedback on my understanding of the material.  The professor also thinks EVERY topic in the course is easy.",1
I took theater for my fine arts elective. We read 3 plays from the books and had lots of online quizzes over the material in the online modules. They are easy as long as you read. There is one group project but there are many days given to you to work on it with your group during class time. He's not the most entertaining person but it is an easyA,1
"Her powerpoints confused me a lot. She's not the type of teacher that gets straight to the point, she wants you to know EVERY SINGLE detail. She often rants abt irrelavent topics too.. No study guides either which made it difficult to know what was on her exams. I regret taking her!!!!!",0
"Abysmal pedagogy, prioritizes insinuations against students' intelligence over rectifying academic misunderstandings. No room for difference in academic opinion. Completely inaccessible outside of class. Has his grad students do all his work for him. Extraordinarily self oriented, considers his own research methods to be the only right way.",0
"Donner is so great! He's a really nice professor and really knows how to make the lecture interesting and lively, never had a dull moment in class. I recommend taking his classes! You won't regret it, tests aren't terribly difficult and there's barely any homework minus some readings, but they don't really matter often anyways  ",1
"The worse class I have taken in a while. 100% group work online, seriously? Have to depend on entire class for quiz grades. You never see what you got wrong on quizzes.  She is short in her responses. Waste of time!",0
Not clear when explaining. Assigns redundant code modifications (that are nearly impossible to read) for nearly all the assignments. Grades more ruthlessly after drop date. Extremely picky when checking homework; don't expect much partial credit.,0
"No, just don't. If you have a choice, which you likely don't, don't take a class with him. If you don't have a choice I would even suggest pushing this class to another semester so it's not with him. If you must take this class with him, read ENTIRE chapter before class discussion. He doesn't teach, he preaches. Group study, and learn on your own.",0
"His lectures are pretty interesting and its important to listen closely. Pretty heavy in reading, but there are only 3 exams and 2 essays over the semester. As long as you read the majority of the material, attended class, and youre able to form an option about the material youll be fine.",1
RUSNAK IS AWESOME.  Three easy short book reviews and one 6-8 page research paper.  Somewhat time consuming but if you are literate you'll easily get an A on everything.,1
"Great Instructor! Awesome feedback. Not too much homework or quizzes. If you have questions, he is there for you. Prompt in answering emails. ",1
Writes in-depth comments on written work.,1
Her lectures are very interesting but not really that helpful for exam preparation. She basically expects you to learn everything by yourself so she's able to talk about the extra things that ultimately are unimportant. She never explains how to do questions but only goes through the answers because she expected you to learn it yourself.,1
"Dr. Blacker is a nice guy, but he loves to ramble on and on. It's hard to follow the lectures as he mumbles and speaks pretty fast. There's no PowerPoints to go off of either. There's 3 exams and 1 presentation and those are your only grades. I only took this class to fulfill a breadth requirement.",0
"Professor Fan is generally fantastic, she has genuine interest and experience  in the field of environmental economics and it shows in her lectures. She's friendly and easy to engage with in and out of class. She has a bit of an accent but it's more endearing than it is problematic. Listen to her lectures closely and you shouldn't need the book.",1
"Stephanie is passionate, but not a good professor. She is all over the place, constantly forgetting things, she doesnt really give homework and when she does its insanely out of our skill level. She also only gives a few quizzes and 2 exams- not scan tron. Also dont hold your breath for your grade. She has taken over 2 months to grade our midterms.",0
I'm glad to have had Dr. Hoffman as a teacher.  He is an example of what a professor with competence and real world knowledge can be.,1
"Easy class, but it's annoying at  times. He gets a little carried away with his charting and sorting. I learned a lot in this class. He has a coursepack and it's very helpful. Teaching at the elementary school is a lot of fun.",1
"gave only 5 assignments that were pretty easy. He was an easy marker as well. No lectures, you just read the textbook and do the practice quizzes. midterms and final exam were really easy as well.",1
Mr. Foster is an excellent teacher! He is very thorough in his lectures and is willing to help. He grades homework quickly and is really organized. Make sure to watch all the lectures and do all the homework. They will help for the midterm and final. I definitely would recommend him!,1
"It is clear that Dr. White knows his stuff.  He's a to-the-point, no-nonsense kind of guy.  He appreciates participation, and is pretty funny at times.  Attendance isn't mandatory, but if you skip class you're done for.  I appreciate Prof. White because he makes his students work to earn the grade.",1
"this is a boring class and he has a really annoying voice that makes the lectures unbearable. he gives weekly papers and there are only 2 essay tests per semester. he talks about nothing for 50 minutes. class is completely unnecessary but discussion is. overall, i would not recommend taking this class. boring and kinda hard.",0
"Aschenbrener was a really good teacher!  I did not always keep up with the assignments.  But I did learn A LOT in her class.  She made it fun and interesting, she really relates herself to the students.  No need to buy a text book which is a bonus!  Only thing I did not like, she picks names out of a cup on popsicle sticks to answer questions.",1
great teacher..you must work hard but you can get an a,1
"Lectures are good, although a bit hard to follow at times. He is however very happy to answer any questions, and explains things well.",1
"Very hard grader!! I was lucky to even get a B in his class. You get 4 essays to complete throughout the semester. He allows you to bring a rough draft and edit with your peers,which helped. Make sure you do homework and participate in class discussions. Try to go to his office hours prior to handing your essays it will help avoid falling a essay.",0
"Great teacher, kept the lectures interesting and had a clear passion for the subject. Only annoying thing is he had us buy a textbook that doesn't have a binding, meant to be put into a binder. Literally never used it, everything was on Mastering Geology (online). Can't be sold back.",1
"I wouldn't say the class is hard but it is demanding. As long as you are good at taking notes and preparing for tests, you should at least get a B. He is a very fair grader, and after the first test the following get easier. The lectures are funny and interesting too, if you pay attention you'll be able to connect and understand concepts easily-ish",1
"Prof. Mirbod is AWESOME! Great lecture and very caring and knowledgeable. Her study guide is very helpful, but you need to read and do the HW to get an A. Accounting is not easy but she wants to make sure you understand. She puts a lot of practice questions online and goes over the problems in class. Best professor.",1
"Hw is myPhysicsLab, each time u get a Q wrong, it decreases your %. He will drop for attendance. Class time consists of 90% group work, before it was 100% lecture. Also, you need to read the chapter and take a reading quiz before each class on canvas imo they're hard. I wish he would go over worksheets in class more. You can use equations on test!",0
"Grade based solely on exams, and exams are very difficult. Even showing up to class every week you can still fail, because questions will not even relate to book or lecture.",0
"the worst posc prof as far as keeping his opinions to himself and mixing his opinions into his supposedly ""objective"" scholarly lectures, he does not show both sides of all issues as profs are supposed to do, teaches his 1 sided views as fact",0
"Very nice, father figure professor. Get's very excited for class/ anything about technology. How class works: Read online text book, 15 Cornell notes on book due for class, group quiz in class, online quiz, Microsoft video project first week, 4 projects the next week, Capstone (final for unit) last week, repeats for all units. All due Friday @ 5pm.",1
"Rodney Pearson is a very intellectual type. I took his class in Visual Basic programming and had little interest in it beyond being a prerequisite for my degree. I had difficulty at first but eventually applied myself, this class 'instantiated' my love for computer programming and I owe this man a lot. Thanks, and keep kicking ass!",1
I would recommended that everyone take at least one class with Lockyer. She is a tough grader but my writing improved greatly with her class because she doesn't just hand out grades. I really had to think about what and how I was writing.,1
"He knows what he is talking about but he has absolutely no clue how to teach it. There were multiple instances when students asked questions and his response was ""because"" that's literally it, no further explanation. Hes nice but he doesn't know how to teach, bottom line.",0
"Advanced Public Speaking - exactly that. Reeves makes a positive and encouraging atmosphere. Sometimes, it seemed like she had class favorites. It is easy to identify the students who naturally are good a public speaking; however, she grows students who do not have as much natural talent.",1
"DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR WITH ANY CLASS!!!!! He is literally the worse professor at Missouri State. He goes way too fast with lectures, makes no sense when teaching, sucks at helping students with questions, doesn't respond helpful in emails, and overall just is awful. His exams are hard to study for and HE IS SO AWFUL!!!!",0
"This was Global Conservation,  You just write essays, 5, 7, 12 page essays. Helps to be in class, i dont think he reads the papers, just checks if you wrote the required amount. Guy tries to fool you, wants you to dis-like him. Smart guy just not as smart as me. I'd take him again. Good professor. Bad Teacher...Think about that.",0
"Prof. Poindexter is very nice and understanding. There is very little assigned homework (online Heinle). As long as you study the vocab on your own, you can get a good grade. Often she will have graded classwork (10pts), especially when attendance is low, so come to class. The exams aren't bad, and the oral exam was easy. Take this class!",1
"She's nice, helpful, and not too hard. Her lectures can get a little boring but nothing terrible. You will have to read a lot.  If you put in effort, you should get an A. She is a nice grader. There is only one test, the final. The final seemed quite overwhelming, but if you study hard, you will be fine. She's really nice, I'd take her again.",1
"The lectures were very interesting and I did not mind attending class. However, he expects perfection in order to get a grade above a C. I have a 3.5 GPA and did not get a single grade higher than a D in his class. He grades papers awfully. He follows no rubric and gives a random grade. He makes grammar corrections that make no sense. Overall bad.",0
Assigned few projects and decided on the spot what they would be. Attempted to teach about Art History without any understanding of it or qualifications to do so. Students were responsible for grading each others presentations. He was removed from the course part way through the semester.,0
"CONS: Took a slow pace, thus consequently less time for more challenging concepts at the end. Lectures were nothing to write home about (unless in frustration). Grades updated only after midterm and final. PROS: Slow pace could be good for some. Good guy, funny, cares about his students and clear knows the subject. OVERALL: Easier than expected",1
"An intelligent lady, absolutely no idea how to teach the material. Whatever you do, do not take her.",0
Houck is an amazing professor. Definitely have to work for your grade but you can learn a lot from him. He is very interactive during lectures and cares about his students. If you do the work and follow his instructions youll do great. Definitely would take a course from him if you can.,1
"She is a great person, don't get me wrong, but she is way too harsh. She is accessible outside of class and is very personal with her students. She grades you on things you don't think you're being graded for. For example, a group evaluation. She will doc points off for grammar when you don't think she is. Just always be cautious of everything.",0
look here look here look here look here look here is all the dude says in his lectures. you will not understand him. I promise that. Take this class with someone else or at a different college.,0
"Professor Leung is a wonderful teacher! He worked very hard to present the material in a clear and understandable way.  He responded to all questions quickly, even over the weekend.  I recommend this class to everyone!",1
"I got an A in this course, but I don't feel like I learned anything.  The professor seemed nice on the surface.  However, he was a huge scatterbrain and his lectures often went on long rants about minor details.  Take this class if you have to, otherwise please don't.  Most of my classmates did awful in this course, he has a specific grading style.",0
"Dr Van Ornum is great guy and he has a tremendous amount of experience in the field. He's goofy, funny and definitely gives you many opportunities to pull up your grade. The tests are easy consisting of mc and 3 short answers .He expects you to participate a a lot so be ready. Only thing is he can be a bit disorganized at times. Easy A if you try.",1
"This professor may have good intentions, but is not on the ball at all when it comes to being prepared and knowing what's going on in class.  Class was ITV so she taught on tv from a different campus...NOT RECOMMENDED. Nice woman but shouldn't be teaching.",0
Great professor!  A different sense of humor but hands down my most interesting class of the semester.  He is a nice guy and easy to talk to.  Tests are identification and essay.,1
"Horrible at communicating, made doing assignments difficult. Wouldn't respond to e-mails, hardly ever available to meet with. One bad grade brought me from an A-/B+ to a C. Don't take.",0
Professor Paul Kirz gives it how it is. Awesome class and his work is the best work ever. Gives some homework and will take you far in the music industry. In his class you will learn not the material but also how the industry works and will give you gigs as well!!! make sure to bring him food too! when you do he will give you your fist pro-gig!,1
No word can describe his class. You have to understand mumble and polish accent to know what hes talking about. I dont think he even knows what he's talking about. He speaks the same language as DESIIGNER except monotone and every now and than a moan.,0
"One of the most pointless classes I've ever taken.  Unhelpful, and you have no idea what grade you get until it shows up on your transcript.  Take this course with another professor.",0
"When I met with an academic advisor, he told me this professor usually taught graduate courses. I felt that was a big influence in how much time and commitment he wanted for THL201, which was too much for a core credit.",0
"Teacher is not helpful at all. I'm sure he knows what he is talking about, but he cannot teach others. Some people shouldn't teach and that would be Chuck Bunn. I recommend you take a different instructor for accounting. Too much hw tests are unclear; what he tries to focus on in class is completely different than what is on the test;very confusing",0
"This professor was not great. She does not give good feedback, and when she does give feedback, it is vague (""Maybe you should work on this some more."") Also, she wastes a lot of class time. It takes her about 30 minutes just to get through the announcements, which should take about 5. Her lectures are redundant, but the information is useless.",0
"Shapiro knows what she is doing, and goes so fast that it is easy to get lost. If you have a solid background in linguistics, psychology, and statistics you can get an A (with a lot of effort), but there are people in class who have only taken the minimum prereqs and are completely lost. Very rigorous and intimidating. Work hard and you will learn.",1
Halsell is really sweet! But she really needs to do better with exams because every exam taken the average was always no higher than a 70 which says a lot about how she teaches. Even tho I did bad on all exams I still passed because she assigns things to balance out your grade for the most part but if you want an A? Well good luck.,1
"Ragan is not considerate at all, does not help when you have questions. Tests are way different than  homework and quizzes.",0
Very hard to understand when you have never taken a French class. Talks only in French when you have never heard it in your life before. Each homework takes about 3 hours and is very tedious.,0
"Great teacher. He's very enthusiastic. Can be a bit disorganized at times but will go out of his way to make sure things are fine if there's a problem. Though, I can't say I liked the idea of having a poetry exam that was as critically graded as it was...",1
"Miss one class? Hell assign a paper up to 10 pg long. Lectures are erratic, jumbled and heavily based on opinion as opposed to fact. Most classes dominated by student presentations, which he interrupts to state his opinions. Wasnt given a single grade all of first semester. To him, if you professionally disagree, youre rude and arguing",0
"Schore is by far the best professor I've ever had. His exams are fair. He wrote the book and has been teaching for a long time- so he knows what he's doing. Definitely go over your notes and mechanisms before tests. Although it was a long lecture and early in the morning, his enthusiasm keeps you up.",1
b-o-r-i-n-g. but easy.,0
I had this prof for A&P and she is so great!  She will do whatever she can to go the extra mile to help you.  She really knows the material and lectures very clearly.  She is tough but is a wonderful professor!,1
"Professor Adolino asks a lot from her students while being very unwilling to accommodate herself. Her quizzes and tests are impossible to study for because of the way she writes her questions (in a subjective tone, including grammatical errors). She grades participation on how much time you have spent on her canvas page. Two thumbs down.",0
"May be a former department chair and may have experience, but he was not a helpful professor. First day of class, he did not mention computers as his interests, and his lectures were really vague. His slides were not specific, did not have any real terms or code, and he had analogies and examples that made the concepts harder to understand.",0
"Prof Humphrey is an excellent instructor! He is such an easy going person. His lectures can be long, but always interesting. I would def recommend.",1
Her past as a living history museum historian comes out in her classes which makes them interesting. Attend her classes as she brings in material culture items that will appear on tests and if you do not attend you may miss particular questions.  She is very fair and helpful if you are willing to work to expectations.,1
Expect quizes everyday. BOO,0
"You'll never have a professor as laid back & understanding as Mr. Brown. Very little outside work. Most of the time you'll wonder how any of it is even relevant. It all makes sense in the end, though, if you actually do it. Gets side tracked talking about the weather & other things often, but you learn to appreciate it. Count on a ""hypothetical A.""",1
His wording style in his tests and homework is horrible. You will get confused at some point. His lecture notes aren't really that great either.,0
"This class was pretty easy and it's only half a semester so it was convenient too. He gives three quizzes and a final, has review sheets for all of them. The paper is towards the end before the final and he grades very leniently on this. His lectures aren't that interesting to me, but TAKE notes in this class! Helps on the review sheet.",1
"He was very unhelpful and doesn't tell you what he expects of the essays. On the first one, I got an A and the second one I got a C. When you ask him for help he disappears. Apparently, medievalists are very busy living in their parent's basements doing jack****.",0
"Super cool professor, and he really knows what he is talking about. He was very engaging and made lectures super interesting and understandable.",1
"This is probably one of the most boring classes I have ever taken in college. She is really nice and tries to make the material interesting, but it just doesn't work. There are identifications and essays for the midterm and final but she does give the questions for the essays out in advance.",0
"Raquel is nice, but she makes this class way harder than it has to be. I don't hate going to class, or dislike her, but she really makes our quizzes/exams MUCH harder than they have to be, I understand she wants us to know the material but she makes it too hard. She is nice, but if you have better options take them over Raquel. Speeches aren't bad.",1
"Avoid at all cost,  one of the smarter professors but likes to talk down to people and treat like they don't know anything.  Most students are there to learn.  Tough tests, tons of homework and takes forever to get graded homework back.",1
Worst Professor.,0
"He seems like a nice guy; however, his teaching method and his lecturing leads it to be a difficult class. Tutoring also did not help with this class.",0
"Wow, where do i begin. horrible lectures and does not help at all in labs. Instead yells at you. Ryerson need to hire better profs. Got a B+ on midterm and ended up with F. I wanted to check my final exam but he wouldn't be in his office. AVOID AT ANY COST!!!",0
He's fantastic! he is ready to help you get the job you want and prepare you for the real world! He is all about helping you in the class too. He'll try to scare you into dropping by sending you emails over the summer and being hard on you until add drop is over then he'll lighten up. Totally worth it! He's great!,1
Worst lecturer ever!,0
"Dr. Sheridan is awesome! I'm not even a history major, but showed up to every class because I liked it that much. He's super knowledgeable. If you are a history major, I'd definitely recommend. If you're just looking for a easy class - Sheridan will definitely make you work, but it's doable. Just show up and do what he asks.",1
"Tom my man! I loved this class thanks to him. He was so helpful outside of class, gave extra credit for making study groups outside of class, and told the best stories. I cried from laughing in his class so many times, and the stories were all relevant and helped me understand and remember the material.",1
"Prof Clark is a sweetheart, he cares a lot about American Literature and knows even more which makes his lectures diverse and pretty interesting. He is old school is isn't great with technology (so no e-campus) doesn't like the microphone (so sit close) and is best in face to face meetings. You have to read--but take Clark!",1
The professor is very clear on what she expects. If you just follow her directions you will do fine. You have to complete weekly assignments and if you keep up with that you will be good.,1
I had been a student of Marys over 15 years ago and have continued to find myself analyzing issues that may not have been possible without our critical thinking discussions and research. Its important to know the span of a semester does not contain what you can learn/apply; the class plants the seed. A prof I would be delighted to see again.,1
Course notes aweful - changed notation 3 times! Final unfair.,0
"A waste of my time. So many assignments that feel as though they belong in a 3rd grade class. Attendance is worth a huge portion of the grade and its almost impossible to sit though one of her lectures. She will spend whole class periods talking about organization and time management, and stuff the majority of us already know. Not a college class!!",0
"she requires many books that you have to order online because some are not available in book stores. Although i highly recommend to not buy all books she does not even use them, also her syllabus was not clear on her grading, i got a 74 and she gave me a D which dropped my GPA by a lot unfortunately. I thought as all professors a D was 69 or 70",0
okay...,0
"Mr. Smith is a genuinely nice man and a great professor. Just go to class and do the assignments and there's no reason you can't walk out with at least a B. He grades tough, but if you are serious about being a journalist, a professor like can only help you.",1
never taking this guy again. He's a joke. University is keeping him to collect dollars. Sad. His classes consist of powerpoint(s). The exam(s) questions are randomly selected from the book. 30 minutes of the class time is irrelevant discussion about old information from the past. I don't appreciate his approach. So much for education.,0
"Avoid at all costs. You are graded on 3 parts to a midterm, a paper and a final. Her lectures are all over the place. She does give out review sheets but she will not have talked about any of the terms in class. She assumes you know a lot of info coming into an intro class. Have to study A LOT for exams. Very unclear about requirements. Do not take",0
"Everyone has their niche. Teaching & explaining is not Rogers niche. One of, maybe the worst professor I have ever had!  Take someone else.",0
"Professor Burow-Flak is one of the sweetest ladies you'll ever meet. She is very helpful and kind, and is highly devoted to helping the students understand the material. I would take her for one of her other English classes.",1
"I learned so much in her class, she will help you out as much as you want- you just have to ask her.  She is an awesome teacher and really nice person, her expectations are high, but not unreasonably.",1
"Dr. Doom is an absolutely amazing professor; one of the best there is.  He breaks down the concepts very clearly and his lectures are lighthearted and hilarious.  He actively involves students whenever he can.  The grading can be tough on tests, but if you know the material, you're set.  And it's hard not to learn from him if you attend.",1
"Very nice guy. He means well, but not a good teacher. He goes through the same material over and over. His class is an easy A, even if you didn't learn anything. Thankfully, I went into his class knowing a lot of coding because if I didn't, I would not have learned anything.",0
"Great guy. Answers all questions respectfully (he seems to really believe that there are no stupid questions), is supportive, and knows and loves what he's talking about. He really hates people chatting when he's teaching, though, and he will go up to you and ask you to stop. If you show up and do your work, you will get an A.",1
"He never gave direct answers. Lecture was very boring and useless. Questions on tests were harshly graded and covered material not discussed in lecture or of great importance. He rarely gave bonus opportunities. The labs conducted didn't line up with the chapter discussed. Luckly, easy points was from online assignments.",0
"Some professors make you wonder why youre going into teaching...weiner is one of them. who calls their students liars? people who have no place in the classroom, thats who.",0
"HE is hot. You will love him, he makes everything interesting. Just go to class and listen and take goo notes.",1
Dr. Tindell is the sweetest and nicest professor I have had so far. She really cares about her students and wants them to do the best they possibly can. Tests are very straightforward right from lecture and study guides she provides for each exam. Although about 5 questions come from independent reading and she gives 2 question pop quizzes often.,1
you need to meet him to know what i am talking about.,1
The last comment is totally not true and the most foolish thing I've ever heard.  Kristy invests herself in her subject matter and her students.  She is smart and creative and fun.,1
"Dr. Hall is a nice prof. Tests are difficult, but they're scaled up. We have to take stats, so take it with Hall.",1
"Thought having an online class the professor wouldn't matter b/c you teach yourself, but I have never had a more unclear, rude, demeaning professor in my life. Unclear grading along with the worst feedback and no room to do better unless you harass her with emails asking what you did wrong and how to improve and she replies so nasty 5 days later.",0
"4 short message drafts 1 research paper 1,500 -2000words group project revising a brochure 2 in class presentation one with group and one with the research report on a Fortune 500 company",1
"I would NOT recommend taking 122A with her. She's super confusing, unclear at times, and most of the time messes up the problem she's doing on the board. She's inconsistent w/ her grading, you could get the same answer on your paper as someone else and she'll mark you down for stupid reasons. She also gets off topic, and makes class hard to follow.",0
"Patrick really knows his stuff, is passionate and informed about the subject.  His lectures can sometimes get bogged down by class discussion but he is a very kind dude and very helpful after/outside of class!",1
If you need structure do not take this class. Professors organizational skills are subpar. The due dates are frequently chnged. Lectures fast paced and content heavy. Quizzes test you on the small details instead of general concepts- I feel like Im looking for a needle in a haystack. Unhelpful at simplifying concepts when asking for clarification,0
"I'm not fond of the guy but the reviews here are unfair. There are 7 essays, two get dropped, and he offered 10 different extra credit assignments this semester. I don't like his style of teaching (lecture is him reading a lot) but he is very knowledgeable and I do feel I've improved my writing because of the essays. He likes people who participate",1
"Professor Stewart was wonderful in ENGL 2230 African American Literature. The subjects covered are interesting. She usually lectures for about 20 mins then the class splits into groups. There were 5 quizzes (lowest score dropped), one paper, and a final exam. If you show up to class, participate, and study for the quizzes the class is not difficult!",1
"Casper is an incredible lecturer. He's intense, passionate, and a joy to listen to--the only teacher who can lecture for 2 hours and hold attention. However, this class is NOT easy. Even for a film major like me, it was still challenging. If you have a good TA, just put in the work and it's not impossible to get an A. RIP Casper youll be missed.",1
"Dr. Jacobson is easily one of the best professors at the college. The workload is light. Her lectures are engaging, lively, and fun. At the end of the semester, you'll walk away from the class intellectually stimulated with a wealth of knowledge that's been distilled from her ability as an instructor, rather than from mountains of arduous homework.",1
"not tough but not always clear.  admittedly uses bad examples.  she has good intentions and if you work hard, you will succeed.",1
"This instructor is very frustrating! She will hand you worksheets, and say ""okay figure out how to do it"", and she expects you to use trial, and error which is a horrible method for learning math. She also will show you the WRONG way to do thing, and not tell you that until after the fact. If you take her get used to teaching yourself the material.",0
cool teacher very interesting class and i enjoyed it very much,1
The best voice professor ever. She transformed my voice. Shes old school and you cant be one of those sensitive types that gets offended over any kind of critique. Pay attention to her critique because she is going to make you a better singer. I absolutely love her! I went from a not so great singer to a powerhouse.,1
"Prof. Boettke is absolutely brilliant and has a true passion for economics. His lectures are fun, entertaining, and crystal clear. He seems to go off topic often, but he is great at relating other topics to economics. I never thought I would have fun discussing monetary policy or business cycle theory, but Prof. Boettke is just that good. Awesome.",1
"Professor Boyles is very kind and can be easily contacted. It's a relatively easy A. No busy work, the assignments have a purpose, and there aren't many of them. Everyday in- class discussions that aren't graded, only to use to your benefit for when you write your papers. It was a fun class to have and not stress about, just do your work.",1
"She is terrible. She grades way to hard, her homework assignments are difficult. Tests are impossible. She tries to be nice, but really she is a fake. Worst prof in the Business school here at MU. For fall break she assigned homework. she assignes way too much for a class that could be easy. Don't take her at all.",0
"Professor Gilbert gave many, many assignments and did not start grading them until over half way through the semester. Numerous students stopped doing the homework since they were not being graded. Her directions or announcements were always vague and not clear enough to do the work efficiently. She did not respond in a timely manner or at all.",0
"He is not knowledgeable about the subjects (World civ prior to 1500), he admitted to not knowing the subject and could not answer some students questions.   You must attend his boring classes, he will hold it against you.  Imagine a boring High School teacher but in college.  memorize what he says and you're fine, think inside the box.",0
Amazing lecturer and is passionate and knowledgeable about the subject - especially Cyber law and international law - Legend,1
"Really great professor! The class is really easy and there is NO TEXTBOOK!!! Really take this class, it is awesome and really fun.",1
Guzman for President.,1
"I enjoyed this class! I have a lot of interest in environmental conservation, so maybe I am biased. This class was online. Her lectures were through VoiceThread. Very long and somewhat boring. She made the lectures the length the class was supposed to be (1hr 15min). And the lectures were necessary to watch. So they were dragged out, but doable.",1
This class should be a 200 level or below class just based on the curriculum and how every assignment in this class is a step by step walk through. It was very apparent that he had no real world experience on this topic and there were quite a few things taught that were false. An example: apparently a web application firewall can stop 0-day attacks,0
"I would not take Professor Aguilar again only because her lectures are not really lectures she speaks about the reading but she tends to go off topic a lot. If youre not much for writing papers do not take her, she only has about 4 assignments and theyre all heavy graded and really long and does not take late work. A lot of research is involved",0
he uses cheap books which is awesome.,1
"Salgado is a nice person, however she gets too caught up in details that are irrelevant. She puts too much emphasis on memorizing Buddhist terms instead of actually learning the religion. She will also send out three emails on Saturday nights about class discussion topics which are unnecessarily long. I would avoid taking her class at all costs.",0
Dr. Lysonski as an amazing Human being! In addition to being a great teacher you can really tell he cares about his students. By far my favorite class I have taken at Marquette. I was a transfer student last fall and it is because of teachers like him that I know I made the right choice.  Great example of what a college professor should look like.,1
"Extremely inconsistent teacher with his lectures vs. the textbook and real time. Exams are easy but confusing at the same time, as there are often no clear and concise answers. Easy class, but not easy to receive an A in.",0
"Good speaker, but can often go too fast, especially if you're only ""mostly competent"" in analog like I am.  Just take your time when you study.  He provides very good help in the lab and outside class.  But... without a doubt the 4505 exam was the single most difficult exam I have EVER taken.",1
"Prof. Olzman is an amazing professor. She is passionate about teaching and it shows. Also, go see her during office hours. She appreciates out -of-class participation. She's great one-on-one too. I got so much help on my speeches and helped with my grade.",1
"She was my advisor - very helpful and nice.  She was always open-minded about ideas expressed in class and never picked on students.  She's a little flighty, very happy - moves her head frequently - picture her as a small bird :)  Very good English prof!",1
"She lets it be known from the beginning that it's a TOUGH course! There's too much material to be covered in 10 weeks. She has extensive knowledge and compassion about this subject. Her lectures were very clear. However, due to the amount of material the tests were somewhat difficult. I struggled on short answers while others struggled on M.C",1
This profesor helped me a lot. She was nice and creative!!,1
Horrible teacher. Never admits shes wrong. All she talks about is the steelers. She needs to talk about going to the gym because shes super husky. Overall weak teacher that gives women a bad name,0
"Extremely disorganized, insecure, and overly-demanding. She never makes her expectations clear. Capable of being cruel and caustic. Beware.",0
"She was an amazing teacher. She was very helpful with anything that you needed, in lab she was very hands on and demonstrated anything that you needed. She would spend the first 15-20 minutes of class to go over any questions that you have about the lesson before.",1
"I took stat in High School, knew this class was said to be hard, simply do not take, take it at your local community college. GPA dropper, Im not going to bash the guy, but just do not take him.",0
one word...DROP.,0
"Terrible professor. There are blatant discrepancies between explicit policies on the syllabus and feedback on written assignments. Quizzes are based on minute details hidden in dense, utterly boring readings. Do NOT take this class hoping for an interesting perspective on Islam--his teaching will make you never want to touch the subject again.",0
"He definitely makes you work for the grade you get, you do all of the homework on another learning platform, I really liked it. His tests are definitely hard... he doesn't tell you what to study you just have to read everything and hope for the best. Fun lectures and no mandatory attendance.",1
if have a chance to chose a any other teacher chose them. Especially if you are learning code for the first time.,0
Professor Corker is smart but she really doesnt seem care about her students. I dont recommend taking her class.,0
Anyone who can ruin Shakespeare for me must be TRYING to be a terrible prof.,0
"Was really hard in the beginning, and slowly start to not care? He let the students teach each other which isnt exactly helpful to every? but not really lecture like. The class seemed like a high school class...",0
Prof. Anzelc is funny and communicative. This class is an easy A. It's split into 2 groups you'll choose which one you want. It'll either be a lot of writing or a lot of building little crafts like a bird house. It's pretty fun if you're creative.,1
"Dry as a class comes. teaches soooo slow, its stupid. It was actually frustrating at times. Do Webassign as you go! He makes a big deal out of needing the book, however you don't need it at all. He's rude when asking questions and will make you feel dumb. His test are hard and no study guide. My first C in a math class.",0
"Josh is a great teacher. Yes you have to show up to classes, but he makes class enjoyable by using humor in every lecture. He is very clear and upfront about all assignments and tests, so do what he asks and you will have an A. There are no curveballs and he offers extra credit as well.",1
"Well overall he is an average professor; not outstanding but not horrible either. His tests are not too hard, and he seems to be very knowlegable. Keep ip with the material and you'll be alright. And I think he has a good personality.",1
"Will is very passionate about math. He puts a lot of effort into his lectures, but he whisks through them. He's a very tough grader, and if you miss even one class, you will be significantly behind, so don't miss classes. Seeing him during office hours was beneficial because he genuinely cares about his students and wants you to pass. But he's hard",1
love her classes!,1
"It takes a certain personality to be in Prof G's class. He lectures quickly and it is difficult to tell what to write down. This class is extremely hard if you don't ""think like a philosopher."" He allows students to resubmit homework assignment to maximize grades, which I why I was able to do moderately well. He is helpful at office hours though.",1
"Amazing lectures. Makes history very interesting. Take notes, study, and get an A. Tests are pretty easy - 3, non-cumulative multiple choice.  $10 textbook is great.  Gives about 10 mini quizzes at the start of class to check if you did the reading. They are usually easy, and only your best 8 count. I would highly recommend this professor!",1
"This guy is my favorite accounting teacher by FAR. He is pretty clear as to what he expects, so as long as you work hard, this class won't be as difficult as everyone makes it out to be. You can tell he really loves to teach, and he makes accounting fun and enjoyable.",1
His class is very difficult and was very frustrating. He assigns no homework or review. The only graded assignments are 4 essays and the final. You almost never receive feedback on assignments so it is impossible to know what you did wrong and how to improve at writing. Class started with 32 students. By finals only 7 showed up.,0
"Did by far the worst job adjusting to online classes of all my professors. Tested us in prelims on things we never learned. Extremely rude, he is well know for singling people out for minor errors. Avoid his class if it is not required.",0
Took her during the summer session! She gives a lot of extra credit so it makes it possible for you to pass. She does go off topic a bit during lecture but she teaches well.,1
"Professor Stahl was hilarious. She would throw in humor during her lecture considering the class was almost 3 hours, but sometimes she would let us out early because she didnt even want to be there sometimes which was great. Speeches are easy, grading is clear, would take again.",1
"She has odd rules, like you can't ask questions after class about the lecture, instead come in for office hours. Her voice always sounded condescending to me, like she was teaching elementary school instead of college. At the same time, her explanations are partially mumbled and said as if she assumes we already learned the material. Would avoid.",0
"Dr. Leonard might be a nice person maybe outside of school, but I feel that he does not actually teach the course material. Every class he talked about random subjects, and honestly i wasted my time attending. I showed up to class for the participation grade and it was still average. Im sorry but i would not advise you to take his class",0
"Only 2 exams which are pretty hard given the material... He rambles in class and there are several required readings... Hard to tell what is pertinent and what isn't. Seems like a nice guy, but pass on this class unless you really need it.",0
"AWESOME, PROFESSOR! His tests are easy if you attend class and know what's going on. It involves a little bit of math work and if you miss those classes you are lost. Very engaged in the class and funny and makes learning about the economy crystal clear.",1
"He is an easy grader, but pushes his views down your throat and if you do not agree or stand up to him in class and challenge him, your grade reflects that.  Class is easy, but repetative.",0
"As long as you like programming, you'll love this class.  He knows what he's doing, but prepare to spend a lot of time outside of class if you want an A.  If you don't want to make effort outside of class, major in something other than Computer Science.  Great teacher.",1
"Nice man, pretty conservative and not afraid to let you know just how conservative he is.. I hope he considers posting more articles for BOTH sides of the argument rather than just articles supporting his beliefs. lots of work so make sure to keep up",0
"Best professor ever! Maybe he has changed recently. I don't know about the review of him in the past, but now his attitude for work is very nice! His teaching is very logical and clear, with smile on his face! The exam is totally ok if you follow the notes and practice question.",1
DONT take any class with him! period. i had to take take this course otherwise i would have dropped it. EXTREMELY boring lectures and he basically tries to teach only with his mouth. he barely shows example. AVOID this PROFF at any COST.,0
Not a very nice person and very opinionated. He is supposed to be a deacon but he seems pretty politically weird to me. Take any other religion teacher instead.,0
"SIGN UP FOR LEE DEANDA'S CLAS CLASS. As long as you do the bare minimum of getting homeworks done and learning the word problems mechanically, you can easily pass this class. But don't fall behind, because this course is made one of the hardest at SB simply because Akemann's the professor. You got this.",0
He doesn't really explain well in class lectures. His examples were straight from the book without actual imput from him. He plays irrelavent math games in class on purpose to get the students interested. He relies on the students to catch his mistakes but if a student is learning material how would we know the mistakes.,0
Extremely tough course and the instructions are not all that clear,0
"Ortiz is great in class, but he is also a great advisor. If you need advice for choosing classes, he points you in the right direction depending on your interests. He is in charge of ""administrative studeis"" and his students get great advisement. He even helps over the phone.",1
"His focus is on critical thinking more than writing. But that's what made it fun! Lectures can get boring but its ok for the most part. All you have to do is write 4 short essays, that you can write in a couple hours. Defintly recommend his class!",1
"very unfair grader, does not care about her students at all, dont take her class",0
"I tried giving Professor Saudino a chance throughout the semester even after many people were telling me how awful she was. Believe me, Developmental Psychology is an amazing class with so many interesting concepts, but Professor Saudino is rude to her students, makes the class difficult for no reason, and has ridiculous policies.",0
"Amazing prof. Funny, calm and very intelligent. Highly recommend!",1
"If youre debating on taking stat with seraphin, I recommend against it. Its doable, but your grade will suffer. For word probs on the exams, you must right EXACTLY what he wants or you get points off. The material itself is quite easy if you pay attention, but hes very picky and if you go to office hours, prepare for him to make u feel dumb!",0
"She finds a problem with everything you try to do, and then contradicts herself a lot.",0
Horrible class. Professor did not give any objective information whatsoever. We learned his own viewpoint on events and nothing else. He even renamed a war due to the fact that he felt the war was inappropriately named. Depends entirely on books and his TAs to do the grunt work. Worst class/professor I've ever seen. Avoid at all costs.,0
"Do not take this class. I am in her HIS 154 class right now and the workload is over the top. The HW readings are lengthy and do not correlate with the lectures whatsoever. I spend over half of my HW time on the analyses and get a 60. My GPA is 3.9. Ironically, she won't accept HW with more than 3 mistakes but she makes more grading them. AVOID",0
"Rather an unfair grader. Quizzes are unreasonably difficult, with uniform 10 minutes and does not allow for DSP extensions. Gave a window to contest Final exam grades then proceeded to allow the final grades to be posted too late to contest. The least empathetic professor I've met in my academic career, and I took her class during the pandemic.",0
"Professor Shira was a fantastic professor and I would most definitely recommend enrolling in any class he teaches. Shira is very caring about his students and wants each and every student to succeed. For example, at the end of the semester he told me he believed in me and was excited to see how my life turns out. 10/10 would recommend for a friend",1
Professor Roman is super nice and always cracks jokes in his lectures. BDM is a challenging course and you have to work at it if you want to do well. Roman's assessments were (for the most part) fair and he gave lots of tips/hints for exams and assignments. People are blaming the course being difficult on him and simply wanted an easy A.,1
His lecture was boring. All the contents and examples are directly come from book. Strong accent. Quiz and mid term were directly come from homework. Final was also close to homework question. Easy to get A. Overall good. I do recommend him.,1
"His tests are extremely challenging. He teaches you so much more information than needed for a general chemistry class, including Chemistry 2 and Organic Chemistry material, and puts the hardest trick problems on tests. You need to be very smart and work very hard to do well, which is possible. After getting an A, though, I am happy I had Wingrave.",1
"He is one of the worst professors the university of waterloo has to offer. Very disorganized, lectures are essentially useless as you learn nothing from attending. Accent very thick. Midterm and final were brutal. Assignments do not reflect lectures whatsoever. Horrible teacher, but a pretty nice guy",0
DROP THIS CLASS. I've had some bad teachers before but this one was just too much. His instructions are unclear and unorganized( i.e changing solving methods half way through). I didnt think it was possible but he made math more confusing. Teachers were suppose to make it easier not harder.,0
"Greg is Love, Greg is life, Grag is an absolute legend. Even if youre trash at math (like me) he is available to help. If he notices you struggling in class he will help you. His class is hard but not unreasonable. His notes arent gibberish and he really cares about his students. Actually the best prof Ive ever had. Take his class!",1
"An easy online elective course to take. Do the online weekly work, you get an easy A. The exam is easy enough (so much that it's basic common sense, especially the long answer). I'd recommend taking her as a prof.",1
Seriously DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS CONSIDER THIS A WARNING! IT'S NOT WORTH IT. Professor Butts is a nice lady but she makes history seem like the devil.  I use to love history before I took her class. THINK TWICE BEFORE SUGNING UP FIR THIS CLASS BEFORE ITS TOO LATE!,0
Doc is my fav SOWK prof at MU.  His lectures are so helpful and his stories are great to listen to.  If Doc would teach every class I'd take him again and again.  I enjoyed going to class and never wanted to miss it.  ,1
"I took FCS 324 as a FAST COURSE online class being a FULL-TIME student & a mom of 2 toddlers. With that being said if I could do it you guys can too. I don't know why she has a low rating when her class is EASY, but you do have to invest time in her class due to the assignments and DBs. I would highly recommend her class! U do have to buy $90 code",1
"A 3 and half hour class of talking and watching videos. If you are into Art and it's history then you might enjoy it but if you are not then do not take this class. Attendance was mandatory, and there is a lot of studying you need to do unless you have good memorization.",0
"Professor Frost was interesting and funny, but his grading was tricky. You better read for the exams. ",0
"Don't take this prof!  Very unclear, unorganized, and not Professional!  Trust me on this you will thank me.",0
THE MOST BORING CLASS I'VE EVER TAKE LE COURS LE PLUS ENNUYANT QUE J'AI JAMAIS EU,0
Please do not judge Duggan so harshly due to the first two papers of this section. Honestly this class was one of the hardest I've ever taken but he truly does care about you as students. The one thing he and the history department do not like are those who don't try to improve or give up. Give it your all and GO TO OFFICE HOURS WITH ANY QUESTIONS!,1
This class was less CS and more business oriented. It's all research and preparing presentations. I did not like the lack of clear direction and moving goal posts. She's exceptionally caring and takes lots of time tending to each group. The time commitment was extreme for just 3 credits. Thankfully she doesn't grade too hard.,1
"Her style of ""teaching"" is having her students read a ton of articles and summarize it in her specific way, and learn from that. Then you have to teach exactly how she wants you to teach, or she will tell you you did it wrong but not how to get better; very frustrating, would recommend taking prof Gerson or anyone else for this course",0
Seems out of touch with reality - John Walker would understand!,0
"rude, would not reply back to your emails, not approachable, and makes everything harder for no reason. avoid at all costs",0
"Worst teacher I've ever had at any level in my whole life, and I did grad school.  Vindictive, nasty, petty and ineffective.",0
I had a hard time with this professor. She made things more complicated! I would like it if she could make her work more easier on the students. She has this expectation of you to understand her complicated steps which most of us don't get. Her last name  definitely describes her. She goes way too fast on her lectures. Be prepared if you take her.,0
Dr. Neupane really wants you to understand the material. Was available and willing to help before and after class. He does have an accent but is easy to understand. Hopefully I can take him for physics II!,1
The course is pretty hard.  and the tests were pretty tough. quaicoe is alright.  i found him a little confusing though,1
Her classes are so difficult!! Always tons of reading to do & her tests are nothing like the material learned. Find a different professor!,0
Horrible professor! Do not take her at any cost. She does not help when you have questions so you get a horrible grade. She does not explain what she expect from her project only tells you to refer to the syllabus! She is not willing to help in any way and attitude if you ask her for guidance. Avoid her if you want to make a decent grade! ,0
"Keeps class entertaining, very approachable. Not too clear on how he grades or what things are worth. Takes attendance for every class, but never mention if it would be part of the final grade. Uses webcourse for most of the assignments, no textbook use. Got B+ because I forgot about a few online assignments, overall not bad.",1
"She's a nice lady and is overall very intelligent when it comes to the language. However she gives you so much work, she must think it's the only class that matters. Don't be late or miss class or you'll fail. Four in class presentations and one is done with group. Oral presentations as well each week. She's nice but she'll kill your GPA.",0
"Leona's class is extremely interesting, but is equally as challenging. It is a little bit disappointing, as you often feel like you have learned from her feedback, but you never seem to get it just right.",0
"I dreaded going to this class every Tuesday! I was there from 7-9:30 at night and it was torture! He is very monotone, has an accent and his handwriting is awful! All he does is draw charts all over the board and read from the PowerPoint. Im sure he knows what he's talking about but I would find another teacher if interested in taking this class",0
biggest waste of money in the universe to even be in this class. watch the MIT lectures on opencourseware and those will get you through (hopefully). i hate this guy with a passion. i hope he retires before he can ruin more lives,0
"Very inconsistent, he LACKS a lot of communication with his students, does not respond neither emails or calls. He will not mark you in you are even ten minutes late. Heavy accent, if your a good listener you will do fine he literally reads off the power point, and often rushes through everything. He's very knows his stuff but lack teaching skills",0
"I love Gino, there is no more to say. His classes are just a lot of fun, he has an amazing ammount of charisma.",1
"Russell certainly cares about her students, but doesn't know much and lets her political bias seep into her classes. She called all Republicans ""Confederates,"" for instance, and when asked question about Shinzo Abe admitted she had never heard of him. She often got distracted in lectures, showing more Game of Thrones videos than actual material.",0
"Back again after finishing the class to its entirety to say.. that was a waste of my time and money. Professor Martin said she would make a ""special exception"" for those who turned an essay on time to grade said essay by the day of the final. Come to find out, she has not even started. This essay was important as it was needed for the reflection",0
"Unless you are familiar with complicated high level mathematics, do not take financial economics. Math skills aquired solely from economics courses will not be helpful at all in this course.",0
Very nice teacher and likes to add humor to his lectures. Lectures mainly consist of his personal stories and how they relate to sociology. He does not discuss everything in the textbook so it is important to read through it.,1
"Colonel runs the class in military style. All assignments are done with your ""team"" which is assigned at the beginning and used the whole semester. Tons of field trips so bigger time commitment than other classes. Lots of assigned reading but you can get away with not doing any of it. Strict with due datestimes so don't be late. Reasonable person.",0
Prof. Shine is a good professor. Hes very knowledgeable and understanding. His lectures are difficult because most of the time he will go off topic then switch back to the topic. Its nice to have the option to redo your midterm until youre happy but its tough when you dont know whats going on. Lost interest quick due to confusion.,0
Worst teacher ever. I do not recommend.,0
THIS GUY IS SO INTO HIMSELF...14 PG SYLLABUS....1 WHOLE PG ON HIMSELF WITH HIS PICTURE??  I HAD TO PRINT 50 PAGES OF LINE...THAT WAS YOUR TEXT BOOK.  VERY BY THE RULES TYPE OF GUY.  TELLS ALOT OF STORIES ABOUT HIMSELF....VERY BORING!,0
"Gordon's ideas are convoluted, and poorly explained. The classwork is redundant, but at least you'll never have to worry about failing if you show up- the classwork is beyond simple, and the grading is so generous that you literally don't have to try. He's not at all a competent instructor. Unhelpful, stubborn, and rude.",0
"While I really like her as a person, I found this course confusing. Exams often did not refect our study guides and the course lacked cohesion.  But great person, really.",0
"I would strongly recommend not taking this class. Speaking to my experience with Barreto online, I can tell you two things: 1) He teaches nothing. It's all ""fill in the blank"" reading assignments (easy, but you don't learn anything) and 2) He will not Email you back, no matter how many times you email him. Incredibly unresponsive and unhelpful.",0
"Surprisingly not bad. I received perfect on the M/C section of midterm and 35/40 on coding. He basically gives out a free 8% for file upload and index page. The only thing that is hard is the final (worth 50%). NEED TO GO TO LECTURES, HE GIVES OUT A LOT OF HINTS!",1
You can't miss her class a lot because she stamps your homework and if you're not there you're only allowed to make one up through an additional extra credit. She makes it very unclear at the beginning of class how she wants her exams to be done. She's not a bad teacher but I wouldn't take her again.,1
"Dawn was a very hard teacher, she expects you to know all the material already. In class there is 5 mins of instruction and its basically her telling stories about her job that don't connect to what you are learning. Class time is 2 hours of study so be prepared for that. She doesn't teach the material, you will have to learn it on your own.",0
"He talks very loud and fast, and for me personally is hard to take lecture notes. If you don't take notes be prepared to read and do some research. ",0
"He makes a good laugh because you dont know what the heck he's talking about. But he does like you to draw like him, not in your own style, thats the downfall and he disappears A LOT...so if you ever need help dont get too excited if he comes your way he could change direction.",0
"Easiest class ever. A midterm, final, and like five papers of three pages or less. Tons of extra credit too. Plus, his entire midterm and most of his final can be found online on sites like quizlet and studyblue. I never did any of the assigned readings, and I barely missed a point all semester. Easy A. Great for boosting the GPA.",1
Very good teacher easy lectures and quizzes,1
"Dr. Malkawi is one of the best professors at NWMSU.  He has a passion for his job, and to see his students succeed. If you go to class, pay attention, and do the worksheets he hands out, you will do fine.  Organic Chem isn't the easiest subject to learn, but he makes the material understandable.  Great teacher",1
uhhhh....sucks. doesnt care at all about his students. Please just retire and do us all a favor,0
"The only prof who knew and cared who I was. Makes you want to do well! His material is 20x harder than Dr. Murrin's but he's a much more exciting prof. You need to go to his classes. He basically tells you half of the exam. Lab is hard though, just accept a bad mark lol.",1
"No group projects, no quizzes, a few discussion posts for extra credit (which thankfully bumped my grade to an A), exams are monitored and you'll need to read the book in order to pass the exams. Overall, on the easier side. Never had to interact with the professor except for a couple of messages in which he responded promptly.",0
"her class is mostly powerpoints, her class is easy if you take notes and read the assignments. you'll get a good grade once you read the assignments, show up to class and do the essays. she tells you what she wants in her essay paragraph by paragraph as well.",0
Out to prove that alternative lifestyles our cool at Christian Universities. Not a very scholarly prof.,0
"Easy class if you have chegg and/or a way of getting old assignments and tests, pretty hard if not. He assigns the same homework and uses the same exams every semester. As for teaching, he doesn't really. He writes answers to problems on the board without explaining how commands work. I taught myself. Lenient on late assignments and overall nice",0
Reviewed slides of stuff he did 25 years ago... yea. nuff said,0
"Well-structured syllabus, doesn't respond well when contacted, poor grader, gives generic or little to no feedback on papers even when asked, at least 3 quizzes a week, supplies all of the readings aside from 1 book and movies (around $60 if rented), no extra-credit, strict deadlines (no exceptions even for work or emergencies), harsh late penalty.",0
"Don't take him!!!!!!! Boring, sarcastic, and a very tough grader. Class is only based on essays no book work.",0
He was late to class often and did not apologize.,0
He's hilarious! He makes class super fun and he really knows what he's talking about. The information he has on this topic is never ending. He gets off on tangents a lot and can get a little boring but he always brings it back.  If you can't appreciate music in any way you'll hate this class and waste your time. If you can then you'll love it!,1
"His lectures are great! At the end of every class he had a demo to see the concepts we just learned in real life. The only problem is that his voice sometimes was pretty low. He prints all the lecture notes and small classwork activities and hands them out at the beginning of class so if you miss a class, makes sure you get them from him.",1
"LOVED this teacher. He is older so he has stories he likes to tell but he explains the math in such an easy way you don't struggle! NO book needed, it's online. Tests are open book/notes, quizzes can be worked in groups. Easy class but you also learn. I love math now because of this prof!",1
"Excellent prof, knows his stuff and is excited about sharing it. To top it off, he has a great sock wardrobe!",1
"Very specific requirements for short papers. Claims to give excellent resources but deducts points if you use the ""wrong"" resource given. Offers no guidance when you ask how you can meet her standards. The course content is easy however you will spend the semester trying to figure her ways of doing things out. She was relatively fair on discussion.",0
"Dr. Joe is one of the kindest Professors I have ever met, he truly cares about his students future. He is an all around mentor, not just a Prof. He truly strives to see his students succeed in their academic and personal lives. He makes the class enjoyable and will make you miss it when the semester is over. STUDY for his tests and go to SI!!!",1
"Easiest class I've ever taken in my life. Easier than just about any high school class you could imagine. No exams or final, 10 online quizzes ( answer was ""a"" to every single question) 5 in class quizzes only difficult if you don't show up & somewhat listen to what he says, and some clinical hours. Easy GPA booster if you need an elective.",1
"Terrible teacher. If you've taken 2470, you'll be fine. If not, you're screwed. Extremely disorganized and confusing. Many test questions consist of the most trivial, poorly-worded questions and answers possible, often not related to the course/lecture at all. Unfortunately, she's on tenure w/ Dal",0
"She is a great teacher! Fantastic woman, and pretty easy grader. She is very very down to Earth, and if you don't like what you got on your essay, she let's you re-write it and hand it in a again. If you go to her office hours, she will go through your essay with you and tell you exactly what you need to do to get a better great. TAKE HER!",1
Not clear on grading and basically impossible to get an A. You can follow feedback after feedback and never be given higher than a B unless she likes you. For our final project she didn't have any feedback and nobody got more than a low A no matter what. Seems impossible to please.,0
"He gives you study guides for the tests but there are many things that you're tested on that are not on the study guide. His class is so boring, lectures are long, and I never looked forward to going to class. Nice guy and teaches well but I didn't feel like I learned much.",0
"All we did was write 4 reflection papers. He is extremely unclear and unorganized. He didnt even upload the syllabus or readings until the 3rd week of the semester and the paper was due that next week. Honestly, an easy class as long as you just write the paper. You dont even need to do the readings as long as you can answer the prompt.",0
Tim Ball is a solid choice for SCOM 123. The class itself isn't hard as long as you do your work. His lectures are engaging and entertaining.,1
"His class was very enjoyable! His lectures were very helpful, as he provided many examples as well as providing graphs. He had no issue answering the same question multiple times in a row, changing it up to help the certain student understand the example. A very kind man, would 100% take a class with him again!",1
Don't take her trust me you will regret it,0
"Shes a great prof, very well organized class from beginning to end. Several papers 3-4 pages long, midterm, final and a presentation. take down all the info on the powerpoint slides and you'll ace the exams. Gives quizzes but usualy hints when they are and drops the lowest two or uses them as extra credit points towards your grade. take this class ",1
"One of the best professors I have ever had. She is extremely fun and keeps the class interesting, while sttill keeping the clss relevant and educational. If your goiing to sign up for Interpersonal communications TAKE HER",1
"Steve was possibly one of the most inspirational mentors I have ever experienced. He really opened my eyes to the importance of observation and natural history. Steve is an inspiration and a very genuine individual. If you care about the beautiful world around you he will know, don't be a plugged-in apathetic sleepy head.",1
So patient and understanding.,1
Unfair,0
his lectures are horribly boring and useless. he talks slow because he does not know how to explain himself.material was difficult so you dont really understand what you are reading in the text and he doesnt teach very well. usually when students use the textbook alot its because the professor does a horrible job of teaching the material.,0
This is the worst professor I've had at San Diego State University. His grading scale is the work of a complete lunatic. Perfect attendance copious notes the entire semester still did not give me a grasp of the subject. He lets you have all of the class materials at your disposal during tests an everyone still fails. Don't take this professor...,0
"I took Bull's class this semester, and I don't regret it. He's nice and cracks jokes during class, and showing up isn't really mandatory, making this class an easy A. If you're looking for a real biology class, this ain't it, bc I learned more about forensics than anything else. I ended up not having to take the last test because I already had an A",1
"This prof's curriculum, philosophy of fitness, and understanding of appropriate cultural norms are dated at best. From stretching out student's legs in class to a highly problematic powerpoint on people from different countries in the world ( which showed physical possessions around a family's house and listed Africa as a country), not great.",0
"I was really excited to take this class. Sadly, Dr. Craig's reliance on dull textbooks (a hundred pages of reading a week no less), ludicrous lectures and an unrealistic level of expectation on students ruined this class for me. This is one to avoid, it will not only bring down your GPA but give you a migraine in the process.",0
"He really cares about how you do in the class but does make you work for your grade. There are 2 projects, 3 exams, and 6 extra credit quizzes that are really helpful. He does curve the exams so if you pay attention and come to class, you should be able to get an A.",1
"Awesome guy, quite the character, clearly loves teaching and extremely passionate. If hes teaching you anything about anthropology your in for a treat.",1
She will be very harsh when talking about the other religions and belief systems. She is very negative about them and refuses to think about the religions from anything but a Christian point of view. Her tests are also very difficult and the material is not always discussed in class.,0
"You really need to show up and listen to her lecture to take good notes. She doesn't do PowerPoints and you have to invest a good amount of time studying to get pass the exams. I think I got an A- because she drops your lowest exam score and somehow I passed the final. Her ""group"" projects are graded really harshly and specifically.",0
"Professor Cramer only gives out about two museum paper assignments and 2-3 exams, which are non-cumulative. He has his own website that lists all the works and terms you need to study for, but you still need to take good notes to succeed on his exams. He rewards active participation and improvement too, and is an all-around excellent professor.",1
HE is awful. DO NOT TAKE. he blocks the board with his body so you can't see his examples. He stutters all the time. Very rude when asking for help. I got a B in the class only because I had taken precal my senior year.,0
Good prof,1
"She has made so may people i know cry and try to ruin their careers because she has a horrible habit of choosing who she likes and hates. She hates most girls. She has always been great to me, but when she treats my peers so poorly its hard to think she's genuine.",0
"Often does things without telling students including making midterm dates and putting notes on tophat. When the midterm was cancled he didn't email the class with the new date, instead making the next class the midterm. Basically all the work is homework, expect 5 hours of reading every couple days. Not a good class when you already have a workload",0
"Ms. Wayland does not respond to email or in course messages in a timely fashion.  She neglected to post the last discussion for the semester, and she did not respond to emails or messages. After the discussion was due, she posted that we would all get credit .  I expect greater professionalism in a graduate class.",0
"An interesting subject, but the online class was not the best teaching format. The professor did not put up a grading guideline initially for the first paper and ambiguity is not good with a class which also ask the student for a creative response. Not the best experience I have had with an instructor regarding communication. ",0
Won't regret it.,1
"A very unhelpful statistics professor. Spent no time elaborating on or explaining the material. Did a poor job of answering conceptual questions.  Contradicts herself and the textbook. Insists on the importance of programs like SPSS and Excel, but fails to teach you how to use them. There are much better professors here.",0
Best professor at GVSU.,1
Great teacher. All PowerPoint. Only Hw you'll get is one paper at the end and a midterm and final. Gives 2 weeks worth of skips. Watch a ton of movies,1
"Karen Slawter is a nice lady. However, she thinks that her classes are the most important class you'll ever have to take. She is an EXTREMELY difficult grader on your speeches, and gives tests over material you will not cover in class. No real study guide. The tests are worth 100 points, and so are the quizzes. Worst class I've taken at NKU. ",0
"This teacher is great at lecturing and a wonderful easy going teacher.  However there was never much clarity provided on expectations of writing essays on tests and grades were given very late so the chance of rebuttle was slim to none.  Also, there is too many chapters combined for one test (10) to be exact you are cramming the entire semester",0
Strict schedule for online class; uploads assignments weekly. Gives timed short answer quizzes based on the modules she gives you. It's not the most interesting of classes but you will learn a bit if you do the work. Multiple discussions and attendance of a live performance is required. No extra credit.,1
Matt is an amazing instructor and makes learning stats easier.,1
Not available outside class. Always tries to avoid students and their questions. Not organized at all.  Made simple things more complicated. Never gonna take his course again.,0
The best professor I have every had. Absolutely amazing.,1
Enthusiastic and very helpful... Shows a lot of concern for student progress. Extremely challenging but will be very rewarding. Probably my best prof in University.,1
"Overcomplicates simple material and says is available for office hours but isn't all the time. Exams aren't hard at all, but when you learn nothing all from the teacher it becomes much more difficult. prepare to teach yourself",0
"Not many grades in this course, 3 tests make up the entire class grade so its important to do good on these, Stoller is a interesting guy but gets very rambly and off topic constantly, most of what you learn in class and take notes on will just be random things possibly not on the test. Its hard to tell whats actually important in this class",0
"she is kind of a a wacked teacher. she has her favorites, girls. As for a 2 credit class the work load is way to much. She also likes to pick on students. i would not take a class taught by her again. save yourself...",0
Terrible Prof. Exams are Impossible..........always confuses himself........doesn't care about anyting but sailing..........and galapagos.......do not take him he sucks.........he does have a badass earring,0
"Very enthusiastic even when everyone is tired in the morning. Makes class fun! Teaches exactly what we need to know. She does spelling bees, games and videos to help us learn. Great instructor with a great personality!",1
Helmreich is so passionate about statistics and passes that passion onto his students! He made the class exciting and engaging. We had no exams. Our grade is solely based on problem sets. What he wanted though was not clearly stated in the problem sets; I suggest taking a lot of notes to mimic what he does in class on your problem sets!,1
She doesn't want to see her students fail so will curve a lot but chem for engineers is a hard class to begin with so be ready to struggle.,0
dr. west is great.  he is by far the best h2p4 lecturer and drill instructor.  very laid back and likes to actually make sense of the crazy range of ideas covered over the semester.  very fair grader!,1
Professor has a great sense of humor. Keeps the class very lively which was very helpful because of the late timing. His notes really helped me to navigate the course material and his test reviews were helpful and concise. I thoroughly enjoyed the class and would recommend his class to anyone who needs/wants to take BIO110,1
"He is by FAR the most unfair / unforgiving test grader Ive ever come across in all my years. He takes points off for whatever he feels like, and yes, as someone else mentioned, he is a true sophomaniac, and needs a new pair of readers to see that hes 300 miles from Harvard. STAY AWAY IF YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR GPA.",0
"Sabol is an amazing teacher and obviously knows what he is talking about, but expect quizzes after a reading assignment. He usually picks the most unusual and weird things to question you on, so if you actually read the content then you should be okay. He only has three major exams where you have to write a take home paper, a lot of work!!",1
"Getting a straight answer from the man is impossible. He talks in circles. Grades are erratic, bordering on random.",0
"Although he gives a lot of papers, theres barely any other homework. He never gives quizes or exams. He only used the textbook in the beginning of the semester. And its also to learn in his class because hes very passionate about what he teaches he also cares very much about his students.",1
"This class is a joke. I received a C in this class, which I will take the blame for, I didn't work as hard as I should've. That being said, I am a 3.87 cumulative student, and this was the hardest class I've ever taken. The review sessions do not adequately cover the material on the exam at all. This is supposed to be a Intro class, its not. MCAT.",0
I'm so grateful that Dr Kajiura provides study tips and practice problems for me to work on that help me to understand the concepts faster. Her suggestions gave me the confidence to succeed in the course. I know that those helped me a lot.,1
Love her! Great professor.,1
Mrs. Holmes is one of the best teachers I've ever had. She's very personable and definitely super caring. Her class is so fun! Lessons are very easy to follow step by step learning & she makes sure everyone understands the concept before moving on. She makes sure everyone participates. I would recommend her to anybody. Definitely choosing her again,1
"I never went to class and still got an A, she doesn't require lab attendance.",1
I was not in his section for lectures but I was in his section for tutorials. He's very clear and helpful. Better than my own professor. ,1
i think this teacher is ridiculous. He would rather drop students then help them. i know someone that supposedly failed a test and when they asked to see it he told them that he threw it away! he also  belittles students in the class room when they are trying to ask questions and get help,0
Pretty rude to students who have any questions,0
"Fred is very nice and smart, but the hardest grader Ive ever had. You must copy write ups word for word out of his textbook and if you forget a single word its 50pts off each time you dont write it. He is not flexible with grading and anything below a 75 youre failing. I am a A student across all my classes and he failed me.",0
"To be short and frank, she is not a good professor. Considering the circumstances (online due to Corona), I tried to cut her some slack, but she has not made learning macroeconomics any easier for her students. She cannot explain any of the material and lectures consist of her reading from the textbook and playing videos we already watched for HW.",0
I took his class my first semester I went t LCC and I loved every minute of it. Yes he talks about his personal life a lot but it's a Psych class and he gives good insight about things and is very interested in what people have to say.,1
Weber is a very Fun teacher! He was there any time I needed any questions asked. He is also very smart. He is not bad professor like people are complaining about. He has never lost any of my papers.,1
"If you can get past the surface, he's incredibly funny, though he is usually very dry.  Lectures can be tedious, but they're usually only once a week, so in the general scheme of things it's not that bad.",0
"This guy is probably so smart, its not his fault he can't communicate what hes trying to teach in a way that his students could possibly understand.",0
"Never have I ever had a 101 class that starts of with so much reading and a 100 pt exam ONE WEEK in. Also, most of the links for the readings have been broken and not repaired. Avoid taking this class at all costs.",0
Nothing she teaches during class is on the exam. Exam questions are so specific you practically have to be a geologist to know the answer. So frustrating,0
Great teacher!!,1
Jon Thom is one of the best professors. He cares deeply about what you write and always gives great feedback. He is so kind too. He offers so much extra credit. I wish he taught every class :),1
She is not helpful and a tough grader.,0
"She gives you the majority of the notes and you never use your book. However, she will keep you late every class cause she doesn't have a concept of time.",1
This class got me into computer science. Suzanne takes on the challenge of teaching people how to program for the first time head on. This course is so awesome for a beginning student. It is a lot of work though. I would recommend experienced programmers look at other options. ,1
"The class is not hard if you watch the lectures, do the study guides and attend the review sessions. Gives a reasonable amount of opportunities for extra credit. My only critique of the course is that there was not enough coverage of animal rights, which was disappointing for me personally. In any case, she's nice woman and a pretty good professor.",1
I thought this class was going to be easy.  It isn't.  I have gotten good grades my whole life and now I'm failing pretty much. He makes his own words up and uses ridiculus hand gestures which distracts learning.  He wants almost wants specific dates on when something was made and the most difficult tests ive ever taken... i dont understand him...,0
"Budd is FANTASTIC. If you want to seriously learn about literature, you need to take his class. He's wonderfully comedic and I wish he wasn't retiring so I can maintain a good friendship with him.",1
He assigns way too much reading and doesn't teach most of the material. His quizzes are difficult and he just doesn't know how to run a class in general. He does give pop quizzes sometimes.  Avoid his class if you can especially if you aren't taking the CPA. Take Audit and Financial Statement Analysis instead.,0
Sullivan does not show much concern at all for his students. He grades very harshly and has three question quizzes every day so be sure to prepare for that. He does not accept questions or opposition and is very unhelpful and often condescending. Will not take this class ever again.,0
"Dr. Henderleiter was helpful at times, but her grading criteria for lab reports was extremely fuzzy. It was the lowest grade I received this semester. Don't take it at 8am; it sucks.",0
I had Dr. Austin for biology lab and she knows her stuff inside and out. She was a huge help for lab and could answer any question my group had. Her on the board notes were organized perfect and she made the information easy to absorb. She always let us know what would be on the next quiz. Information was direct and clear.,1
"I was switched into her class last minute and didn't know much about her, but now after the semester, I would not recommend taking MATH 122B with her. She was not very easy to talk to and her tests are difficult if you don't pay attention in class. She was very harsh at grading homework also. Take this class with ANYONE else.",0
The easiest class you will ever have!!!!,1
"His accent is horrible. It's a VERY DEEP Russian accent. His test are graded by student graders and if you get the answer wrong, the whole answer is wrong. You have to go up to him to get partial credit. No homework and he writes on the chalkboard which you can barely read. Majority of the class only shows up for the review.",0
Class content is really hard to understand. He only writes on the board so attendance in mandatory. His tests are so hard and labs make no sense. There's a final research project that has a presentation component. The presentation is so scary. Max will ask so many questions and make you feel stupid. He will embarrass you until no tomorrow during it,0
Dr. B is the best English professor at EGC. Very passionate and cares for the student!,1
"I don't agree with most of what students below me have to say about this class. This class is an easy A, as long as you engage in discussion forums, read your textbook, study, and ask when you have questions. Grading criteriaclear; do the work and you'll pass. ""DO THE WORK"" does not mean ""do the bare minimum"" my experience with Dr. Orme was great.",1
An easy A.  He shows a lot of movies and shoots the breeze alot but no one really learns very much.,1
"Aced the class, but he's a terrible teacher. You don't learn anything. The class is basically one big tangent, and the grading is a bit random too. Got a perfect score on the final w/ spark notes.",0
"I'm writing this review as a senior and I can say that this course is easily in my top 3 favorite courses across engineering and management.   Don't skip class and be ready to improve.  If you just want an easy A, don't take this course. Mr. Wright will make you work for your grade and if you take the time to improve you will be rewarded.",1
A great capstone class with a good level of engagement by the Professor. Clear expectations. No textbook. Cases and readings assigned. Biweekly message board postings required. Write 2 short papers covering cases. Semester long Capsim simulation that you perform solo. CompXM sim (solo) at end of class. Quick grader and would take prof again.,1
"Pretty easy class, if taken online. Textbook is 100% mandatory as tests are done through there. There is no ""lecture"" that needs to be attended, aka a zoom meeting. Most of the class is just reading a chapter, doing discussion questions, then the quiz.",1
The worst grade I have received at college so far. Lectures are very boring. You have online homework every week through connect. Some homework problems. If you do the homework problems you get the points. Tests were difficult and long. Tests are worth more than homework. Quiz's are 10 questions but 20 points each. No extra credit. ,0
"Dr. Mark is excellent. I kept having technical issues and she allowed me to resubmit the assignments I lost, after the due dates! She gives short lecture videos, weekly quizzes, and group discussions, which can be difficult to organize. The exams are difficult because there is a time limit of 1 hour, with lots of questions, but they are open book.",1
"Taken for summer credit. He's not employed to hold your hand through college and give you a passing grade. He's upfront with how hard he's going to be, and he follows through with his word. Yet, he loves mathematics and will teach you all he can if you want to learn. I'm trying to shuffle my schedule now for Spring to take him for MAT 192.",1
"TAKE HIM!! If you struggle with Math just like I did, he will help you out. He may seem to speed through some of the math problems, but if you just ask, he will take time to explain it to you and re-do it if needed. He really wants you to succeed. If you don't pass his class, it's because you did not try. Get him during priority Registration!",1
Good online class.  Professor was willing to work with you when problems came up.,1
"She's really sweet, really knowledgeable. It's clear she's had a lot of global experience, but in the readings we were assigned (the papers she wrote on her research) make her seem quite arrogant and irritating. But it was an easy and painless 8 wks class :)",1
He gives great examples to help students understand broader concepts and his exams were better than i thought ! Just make sure to read the readings and listen in tutorial very well; I feel that the grades really depend upon the TA you get since they are the ones marking your exams and term paper. But i don't recommend this as gpa booster!!,1
worst professor ever,0
"David is great!! He makes the class very interesting by allowing you to write about what you are interested in. He uses a grading contract, so essentially if you turn in all assignments and put effort into them you will get an A. The class focuses on current issues and his perspective is more liberal, so decide whether that's for you.",1
"Riley is an animated lecturer, who's obviously very knowledgable. The problem is he has extremely high expectations for a level 100 gen ed. If you are not a psych major, don't torment yourself with this course.",1
"Very difficult. She grades according to how she views things and does not have any room for error. Grading is very harsh, somewhat unfair. I studied for a whole month ahead of the ECO 103 final and still got a C! If you are not ready to spend 2+ hours a night on Econ just to pass, I would not recommend taking her class.",0
"Dr. Larson is extremely knowledgeable, interesting, and down to earth. She really knows what she's talking about. She doesn't seem very approachable at first, but she cares a lot and is always there to help as long as you ask for it. I hope I can take other courses with her next year.",1
"Lectures are all online, which is nice, and I didn't have to go to class for the last month since I had an A by the 3rd test. He drops 1 test and a few quizzes, and it's easy to get an A. If you just do like 4 old practice tests to study before each exam, you'll be fine. Bull is a nice guy and class was interesting. Would recommend this class",1
Learned a ton from this guy. He's old school. No fluff and no sitting around shooting the breeze experiential-like.,1
Terrible. This course is so content heavy. All exams are cumulative. He is a tough marker. You need to say EXACTLY what he wants to get a good grade. He will say something is not on the exam but SURPRISE it is.,0
Dont take if you have a choice. Her goal is to trip you up and get you with your grade. First day she always states she has tenure so she doesnt care what the students think. By far the worse professor in the GV computer program. She changes her requirments from class to class,0
One of the best professors at CCNY. She is really caring and makes her lectures engaging. If you get a chance take her and you will never regret it. Make sure you do all your assignment because she gives really good feedbacks and is always available for office hours. SHE REALLY IS THE BEST,1
This class is so confusing had extremely hard!!! I'll probably have to retake it this course but not with her!!!!!!!!!,0
get the hell out! BORING  BORING. and i made an A. how can somebody be so boring?,0
"HE WAS AMAZING. I took him on campus for Econ 1010 and I took it as an elective and he made it so easy and interesting. Yeas you got to go to class as he does not upload notes online but his personality is so good, it's the first ever evening class I was regular with. Makes midterm and finals easy, gives types of questions in advance.",1
"Be prepared to not know when you are presenting, however it is not that bad of a class. He helps you get comfortable with the people in your class and has your best interest in mind.",1
"Scordillis is an awesome guy and wants everyone to succeed. Tests are really difficult, and the best way to get a good grade is to work a ton of past exams for practice. He moves quickly in class, so you need to stay engaged to get something out of it.  Attendance is mandatory for a reason-- this is NOT a class to slack off in.",1
Hes good people through and through.,1
best prof for encs 282,1
"The professor is very passionate and intense about the art of Tai Chi. She clearly demonstrates a life time of amazing skill. I struggled but I enjoyed the class. I hope to take it again. The professor is a proven qualified instructor, not all martial art studios have competent and safe teachers!",1
He is a nice guy but he is SO BORING! I feel like stabbing myself cause he's that boring! I was so excited to take Hinduism but all he talks about is Buddhism! He doesn't use the textbook at all. His test and quizzes are easy. Do NOT take him if you want to learn about Hinduism cause you won't! DO take him if you want a good grade for credit hours!,0
"He just reading out slides on the lecture, doesn't really teach useful notes of assignment. He doesn't post lecture notes.",0
"Cisco!! noooooooo! This guy knows it all. People find his class boring because of all the material he has to teach, but that's CISCO'S fault!....Cool teacher",1
Worst explainer and doesn't help you when you don't understand something. She expects you to know everything.,0
"This was a great course! There were two multiple choice exams and though challenging, you will do fine if you study the text. Dr. Hanson is a very engaging lecturer and uses a lot of case examples and video clips - you will enjoy attending her lectures.",1
"If this professor knew how to keep to the subject matter he would be great, unfortunately, he goes off on tangents (usually about Judaism) and will frequently insult students with inappropriate remarks.  He's very unprofessional and it shocks me that he's been there for so long.",0
"I had him for 752 and 701--pretty much the same.  Interesting readings, but he is not really ino teaching histrical skills.   Like the others wo have commented, I never got my paper back in either class so not sure why I got an A--but I did.  ",0
"Nice guy. However, if you take no other warning take this one. When he says that ""if you are able to do the homework, you will do fine on the test."" -- Just know that is a complete and utter lie. The tests are 50x harder than anything he gives for homework or does in class. If you have not had calc before I would recomend another prof.",0
Chemistry is my absolute worst subject but he's definitely one of my preferred professors that I've had in it. He's really helpful in office hours. Practice a lot. This class involves a lot of algebraic math and chemistry concepts so just work hard for this class. Knowing the nomenclature and remembering some things from Chem 110 is important.,1
"You have got to be kidding me! Ridiculously boring lectures, all class, every class (this is a liberal arts college!), difficult to understand, and a horrible grader. Expects very much from students taking a 100 level course.",0
"The professor was behind on lectures and instead of readjusting the syllabus, we were assigned nearly 300 pages of reading over Thanksgiving. I did not find the lectures engaging at all (no slides) and I found the TA I had to be much more helpful for my papers. As others have said, he is an acquired taste, not for my taste though.",0
Walling is THE absolute worst professor Ive ever had. She Has a bad attitude and is forever in a bad mood. She likes to make smart remarks if asked a question and she is constantly giving attitude or rolling her eyes if you say anything to her at all. BC should really get another professor to teach A&P because nobody should have to deal with her.,0
"Horrible professor. Moves too fast in lecture for notes. Very brief with information. Does not give clear expectations of what we should know for exams, just very general descriptions. Not a hard subject but made studying difficult and just an annoying professor",0
"Nelson is the most brilliant professor I've ever had the pleasure of being taught by.  You cannot coast through his classes---but if you come to class, participate, and do the readings, you really can't go wrong.  He is an amazing person and I will gladly take a third class from him next year.",1
"He's teaching a low-difficulty (for a math course), straightforward 2nd year course - but manages to make it complicated & confusing; he confuses HIMSELF. Every lecture I can't believe how unprepared he comes. Stumbles on what he says/proves, but concludes with ""this is really important, you guys should learn this"". Treats his lectures like a joke.",0
"Prof. Bucklin is loud, vulgar, can be offensive but also sometimes funny. The class is relatively easy if you show up but she has quizzes that are hard. She also gives assignments and then takes 3 months to give you one grade back. The class feels like a waste of time because I don't pay attention but I still have a decent grade",0
"The usual honestly. Not the best, not the worst. He definitely knows what he is talking about, and I enjoyed the one personal response we had (huge mark booster worth 10%), however, if you're someone who doesn't learn well from a textbook, or won't memorize things 100% as they're written, don't take his class.",1
Gives clear explanations and responds to questions well. Gives great study guides and cheat sheets for tests as well as an optional final. Very nice professor.,1
"His lack of organization and empathy toward students - who are trying to learn - that ask questions, off-put many. He makes sure you feel stupid throughout the year. Make sure that any alternate instruction he gives on assignments is in writing because he will forget and take points off. Overall, he has no ability to teach and/or help any student",0
dr. o'gorman is a great teacher that is more than willing to help you enough to make an A in his classes-,1
"His lectures are interesting and I never had trouble staying awake. BUT he's really arrogant, and doesn't discuss, you're just supposed to take what he says as gospel. Also all he gives you all four papers at the beginning of the semester and has no due dates. They're all due the last day of class. He didn't give us any kind of help for our final.",0
He is absolutely useless and he barely knows what he is talking about sometimes. Should probably retire by now,0
"I had him for Deviance.  His tests are multiple choice, and they are not easy (barely made an A).  He is a really good professor, though, that is, unless you do not like dry personalities.  Although, I would take him again.",1
"Self loathing man who probably believes he is God. Seriously spent the entire semester telling students that they should value and worship customers, then followed that with telling the class that the reason he lives in St. Joe is to avoid seeing students outside of NW. Also, complained that is was too much work to spend 7hrs a week in his office",0
"He is highly rude, will make you feel dumb. Will make rude comments if you don't show up in person. Don't ask questions because he will get annoyed. Very hard grader. He would rather move through the notes faster than care about if the students understand what's going on or not. Won't compromise for student athletes for review sessions.",0
"NEVER take online classes with this man. He is ridiculous. I asked for his help a WEEK before mid-term and he waited until a week after it was due to ask me if ""I looked at the examples"" SERIOUSLY?!",0
"Disorganized course, rude responses on CuLearn, and just overall a poor impression of first year programming course. Code that is given to us is laughable. It's so buggy! I don't think there's been a single piece of code that has worked flawlessly with no bugs. If I, a first year student, can find issues in any form (ex: PEP 8), yikes.",0
"Attend class. Purchasing the book isn't necessary, he puts everything on powerpoints on blackboard. Put in effort and you'll get a good grade. Pretty easy going guy and the topics are interesting. Keep an open mind.",1
"Mrs. Dalton is honestly the best teacher at MSU that I have encountered in my time here. She is truly amazing and caring, and really cares about your success not only in her class, but out of class as well. It is an english class, and there is a lot of work. However, she is happy to help, offers wonderful feedback, and is honestly such a gem.",1
Dr. Harper is a super nice guy and has a lot of experience that he likes to share with his students. Hes easy to like as long as you behave in class and show up.,1
"My 4th class with Mike and nothing has changed. Lacks details in lecture topics. Assignments are not as rigorous or technical as I expect. He should cut down on the total assignments and increase the difficulty and quality expected. Currently, the TAs have admitted they grade easy as Mike does not set high benchmarks from students. PS:Lab is a joke",0
"great teacher, definitely will have to put some effort into your grade. Had 6 quizes, he dropped 2, a mid term and a final which you get to use a piece of paper, and a paper which wasnt that bad. Overrall good class and cool teacher",1
"Professor Brubeck was the most amazing professor I have ever had. He made class fun and was always helping us individually if we needed any one on one help. His lectures are never boring. You go to class and actually enjoy it, which is something I have never been able to say before. I would definitely recommend taking him. You wont regret it!",1
"Great proffessor and extremely helpful.  Do not expect to leave class early, but it is worth it.",1
Mark is good as a lab instructor but I have been told by other students that have taken his classes to stay away from him when choosing lecture courses.,1
if you have the chance to take her do it she is by my opinion the best science teacher at the school,1
Dr. Jim was very outgoing and was able to answer any questions you have.,1
"Great lab instructor. Very approachable, easy to speak with, and helpful. You have to go outside no matter the weather, but if you dress properly you'll be fine. I had fun and learned a lot.",1
"As an engineering major, I was not thrilled about the prospect of taking a speaking course, but LisaMarie made it not only bearable but enjoyable. She genuinely cares about her students and her energy keeps lectures interesting. Grading can seem a bit tough at times but is fair at the end of the day. You will need to read the book for the exams.",1
She doesnt even teach at all. I paid 500 bucks for her to literally send out an article with a discussion and some puny quizzes. Then she gives you a bad grade because she doesnt agree on your opinion. Horrible professor and doesnt accept any late work even if you have a legit excuse. She sets her deadline at 10:00 at night. AVOID MARY LOUIS,0
"His tests are a cryptic mess. Over half of the questions are unclear and have little to no connection with what he covered in class. Same thing with his homework, all the questions are unrelated to his slides, which is what he reads for lectures, or the textbook. I feel like he taught what HE believes is good software engineering, which is garbage.",0
Nice professor. Not really interested in the course but he did a good job teaching it. Exams come more from movie sheets than lectures. if you memorize movie sheets and read powerpoints you should do fine.,1
"Nice professor but one of the hardest courses I've taken. 3 exams (30%,30%,40%). If you screw up one, you screwed up you're final grade.",0
"She was intimidating at first but I loved her by the end of the semester. She replaced her NCP assignment with 2 pop quizzes, which are straight forward IF YOU'RE PREPARED. Exams are straight from her notes. EBP paper is toughest part but follow the example she posts. Group presentation is easy. Class is not weighted and is based on points earned.",1
took the online class. Lectures were LONG. I studied lectures thoroughly at first but didnt find the first study guide which killed me on the first test. then i stopped watching his lectures and just studied the final study guide and aced the final. could have gotten a B but didnt know there were listening assignments. Dropped me down two grades.,0
the class is very helpful. if you actually pay attention you realize its good help and prepartion if you aren't sure what you want to do with your psych degree,1
"Very good teacher, but he's VERY tough as well.  He's a Middlebury legend and you will either love him or hate him.",1
awesome professor. take this man. made econometrics really understandable and i look forward to taking 423. gotta buy the text (try amazon) and do the homework. exams are long (6 pages) but he prepares you for them pretty well.,1
"She scares me. I did learn from the course, but just seeing her gives me the creeps. I did get an OK grade, but it was not a pleasant experience. ",0
"I am not good at English, and I got an A.  He is lenient with grading, no tests, just responses from stories in the textbook and essays.  The final is take-home.  Great class,  I'm a better writer because of this class.",1
"Prof. LaRoche is incredible. The course is engaging, and she is very enthusiatstic about her work. The work load is perfect and her assignments are thoughtful. I highly reccomend this course!",1
"DO NOT take Burg! He was by far the worst professor I have ever had at gvsu. His lectures are beyond boring, as he reads his slides word for word in a monotone voice. When it comes to the tests, he expects you to be a genius and the exams are very difficult. He is very rude to his students and he is not very helpful during his office hours.",0
If u are willing to waste an entire semester without learning a single thing about English u should go ahead and take it.. It seems more like history class rather than English his talks too too much about nonsense and leaves way to much papers and gives no help what so ever with the papers and grades really harsh! Be smart and do N0T take his class,0
"He clearly knows what he's talking about, but I wouldn't suggest ever taking his class. I've never had anyone rip apart my writing like this guy. Got mostly Cs on essays even with office hour help. Not to sound conceited, but every prof I've ever had has praised my writing and he hated everything I did. Unless you have no other choice, AVOID.",0
"Classes are mostly useless, talks over everyones head, that being said the material isn't that hard and there are some great online resources. Tests are easy (and very similar to tests used in previous years) and he's very willing to help if you talk to him in person.",1
His tests are very very hard. His lectures are extremely long and difficult to follow. He does not use powerpoint or anything for his lectures. It is also very difficult to keep a good grade in his class. Would not take him again.,0
Best thing to happen to Marymount. He's basically the perfect teacher.,1
I received B.  Hard to pin point what she want in the classes..  the gradings on the paper is totally subjective.  Took night short term night classes..  A lot of assignment and no extra credit chances.  beware..  may be it's diffrent in nomal sessions but  It was not easy for me.,0
I think his classes are useless. I don't understand his explanations. He cannot be a good teacher!a good researcher? Maybe!,0
"I had to withdraw this class cause of the load work hed expect from us, do not take this class if you dont like to read",0
Does a great job of teaching. Class requires consistent work but is a very fair workload for the required outcome.,1
DO NOT TAKE HIM!! He goes VERY fast and does not care if you understand it or not. He grades very hard and his test are very hard. You have a quiz every week and its not just a 5 question quiz its like 10-15 questions and they are all types. I went to his office servel times asking for help and he did nothing..,0
"I don't why there is no option for choosing 185A as his class. I took 185A this quarter, which is complex analysis. He was a funny guy that alway talked about off topic material. He wrote down ever follow his previous notes during the class meetings, which is very useless unless you really understand it. Two midterms and 1 final paper. Aviod him.",0
"Amazing teacher, wants us to be interactive and enjoy the material. Only have to do worksheets and discussion boards in this class. You won't regret taking her.",1
Too many of the concepts felt self-taught. The material feels rushed through in class and it not explained well. There is also multiple homework assignments due EVERY class period. She also said that we should plan on spending at least 6 hours per week on this class outside of class time.,0
She was a good professor. Definitely want to pay attention and take notes. Missed two classes and bombed one of my exams. Simple math with moderate concepts.,1
"i do not like him at all. he seems so full of himself. he is not understanding, yet everyone understands him and respects him. he has this attitude i dont like. it's a very hard class, confusing, impossible to catch up. i studied so much for so many hourse and guess what his test question was? Who is the author of the textbook?",0
"This class is somewhat confusing, you really have to pay attention.  The online quizzes and exams are kind of tough but if you study and feel like you know what you're doing for the most part, you should be fine.  He often curves exam grades or lets you make corrections for credit.",0
"Very opinionated professor, claims he is objective yet his comments are quite inappropriate. demands a lot without providing context. office hours are in the morning before classes (7 am)!!!",0
Exams are very difficult but balanced with other work.,0
She is super sweet and a great teacher. She is very helpful and makes you feel comfortable in her class. She has a sense of humor and is cute and short. She makes you work a little but is very fair and her class isn't too hard.  Good prof!,1
"Plan on several hours of homework, and tests that make no sense.  Working with the groups in her class is frustrating, and time consuming.  Good luck if you take a class from her.",0
"terrible time with this guy in LFS 250 and 350, 250 was the worst class I ever took, waste of time 4 hours gone a week just like that and the course was for a whole year, absolutely useless and nothing taught, very opinionated and we do stupid activities as if we are 5 years old, same in 350 if you value your time and brain cells don't do it",0
Dr. Farkas is a hot papa sita!!! This tall glass of water will leave you thirsty for more. Keep up on your stuff in this class or it will rock your socks off,1
"The topic is pretty hard to grasp during lectures, but he is very helpful during his office hours. He's very approachable and willing to stay longer after class to help you understand anything with which you are having difficulty.",1
"Enthusastic about his research, but what the **** does he talk about half the time?  The guy has no clue.",0
Really RUDE !! IF THIS IS YOUR'RE FIRST TIME IN ASL PLEASE DO NOT TAKE HER . SHE WILL GET MAD AT YOU IF YOU DONT SIGN RIGHT,0
"He is a complete jerk, rude and unhelpful in every sense.  Not a difficult grader though.",0
"Professor very passionate about subject, be prepared to take notes fast, tests are rather difficult-MUST STUDY, but he is always willing to help students",1
"I had looked forward to the uniqueness of Environmental Psych. But it quickly became frustrating with many different versions of requirements for an evaluation paper and presentation. He's very willing to help, but the clarity of requirements is too vague. I was left feeling badly about my initial decision and grade received for this course. ",1
By far the best teacher I've had. I wish I could take him for all my classes.,1
Mrs. Ashby is one of my favorite professors! Shes very down to earth and will help you in any way that she can. I've had other math teachers but she just makes math click for me. I love the steps she gives for all the lessons she teaches. She's very sweet!!,1
"One of the most terrible lecturers in MIS department. I was forced to take two of his classes, and none of them turn to be a good experience. Extremely unorganized lectures, a lot of workshops and homework. Silly attendance counting method. 100% unrecocommended",0
"Worst professor I have had so far at GVSU. This class was all online due to covid. She never answers emails, and when she does, she replies with really snappy responses such as one word answers. She did not answer my emails for a month and a half. Honestly avoid her.",0
Les cours Ã©taient trÃ¨es intÃ©ressants.,1
"Class is mandatory and if you don't go, you'll lose points of your final grade. You just have to be there; you can do other assignments. His lectures are boring, but he tells some jokes. The answers to the essay questions are in the book. His TA doesn't give feedback just the grade. I skipped a plethora of classes - don't be like me, go to class!",1
"Owen white is great, his class was very easy as long as you pay attention and was very understanding. He is super passionate about what he is teaching.",1
"Dr. Andersh is the best chem teacher at Bradley, and I like most of the chem dept. He made a class as bad as O chem doable. He literally wrote a text book for it and gave it to us for free. Even with the pandemic he has gone out of his way to make sure we succeed. Beyond that, he's super great at answering emails and he's just a fun teacher.",1
"It isn't necessarily the easiest American Lit class, and surely there are profs that will mark easier if you're just in it for the easy grades, but Rampton is brilliant. His lectures are enticing and he focuses on overarching themes and things of interest to show the value of studying American Lit on a greater level than just reading books. 1010",1
"She is a little crazy and tends to go on about her personal theories and views a lot,but these can be interesting.the exams are never on those things so don't bother trying to keep up and write them down.the exam questions are way too advanced for the level of the class.however,she gives huge curves!study book and her general notes and u'll b fine",1
"This was one of the most unorganized, unclear, and ill-constructed classes I've ever taken at PSU. I do not normally write bad reviews, but I feel obligated to tell everyone not to take this professor's class.",0
"he really is out there, i accidentally made a ""stat trek trekkie"" comment and hese disliked me ever since, i could never do better than a b- on a paper, hese very impersonal and doent take time to learn anybodys names...i didnt learn very much either",0
"Gina wants everybody to do well in her class and goes above and beyond to make that happen. There are no tests in this class which is awesome. She has a great relationship with all of her students. By far the best teacher I have had at Chico so far. Show up to class, try your best and you will get a good grade.",1
She is not willing to discuss any matter and doesn't go as in depth as she expects on her exams,0
"This prof writes fluff and gets paid for it. He badly wants people to like him, and relies on his looks and egomanical and megalomanical charm. Then, he switches, really fast, to being cuttingly mean with absurdly demeaning email responses at 3 am. If you have him, pretend to like him or else he will hate you.",0
"Jami is so amazing! She made me laugh every class period with her sarcasm and her witty sense of humor. She is a great teacher, grades fairly and cares about all her students. Definitely worth all the reading.",1
I wouldn't take this professor again if your looking for an easy A. Also the material is bizarre and can freak you out. Would not recommend.,0
"Didn't learn anything from him relevant to the class and that hurt me going on to the next level.  He deals too much with personal issues, and doesn't really teach.  He's an easy A!",0
"This class was unnecessarily hard. By the sound of it at the beginning of the semester it sounds like an easy A class, but your grade only consists of 4 things making you have no room to mess up. To make it worse she grades unnecessarily hard!!! Would not take her ever again.",0
He is the most responsible teacher Ive ever seen. His exams are not hard if you study well. For accounting major students That's a good thing to have such a great teacher like him. He is really helpful and you can learn a lot from him. I strongl recommend him.,1
"Too smart for his own good! Took both Organic Physio Chem and Intro to Biochem. Lectures are dry; very difficult to stay awake. Can make a simple topic seem ridiculously difficult. Nearly impossible to pass any of his tests in Biochem. Went to every class, did all HW, studied 20+ hours for each exam, still made low D's and low C's.",0
"Hilarious guy. I am going to miss having him as a professor. The class was pretty easy for the most part. He only grades by having 4 tests, but there pretty basic for the most part. Going to PASS is very helpful. Overall, nice and hilarious.",1
Dr.Nikkel was a fair teacher for the most part. He seems to really enjoy what he dose for a living. His class is mostly him running about the room and looking at these videos. I liked him cuz his work was stright to the point and he really wanted his studnets to learn. Also i got my best naps in his class.,1
"Speakers are great, don't miss them, but lectures can be boring at times. Essays are marked overly hard, but is balanced out with an easy exam. He's a super nice guy in person, go talk to him during office hours. He cares about students.",1
I took his class 171 for elementary teachers and im taking 172 next quarter. He is a nice guy and has a fun sense of humor. works at a quick pace but will answer questions and provide more examples. he collects homework but only grades 4 or 5 random problems out of it. short quiz on each chapter.,1
"The worst professor I've ever met.  A lot of work loads, which form a huge contrast with last year. He is harsh to us. I've never seen a professor who'd like to run away when student wants to ask him a question. He tries his best to make our study more difficult.  His course lacks transparency, not using learn, hide the grade until the very last.",0
He often discusses things that wont be on the test and will often stray from the syllabus and make changes to the course i.e. make a take home test an in class exam and change the date of the test without notice. Focus on reading the text book.,0
long and boring course,0
"Only downside to this class  is laptop use is not allowed.  Note taking is  MUST in this class as he covers a lot of material.  Being able to type up my notes in class would have been very useful. Alas, he is afraid that everyone will play games, so they are not allowed.  Hopefully you can write down names very fast and correctly. Good luck.",0
"2% chaque cours pour les travaux d'Ã©quipe en classe, mais on en a fait a peut prÃ¨s 5 max, donc 2% facile Ã  chaque cours (pour un total de 20%). Il n'est pas trÃ¨s pÃ©dagogue. Ce que j'ai le moins aimÃ© c'est qu'il va plus vite que ce que prÃ©vue au plan de cours et donc lorsque l'on prend un peu de retard dans les exercices c'est difficile Ã  suivre.",0
"Great professor, great class.",1
Bushway was my advisor this semester and i thought he was a wicked nice guy. He was really easy to talk to and answered any questions that i had!,1
Doesn't get students involved. The already super abstract material is made a lot harder to understand by her messy/unclear lectures.,0
"This courses material isn't hard for me, personally PS261 has harder concepts yet i'm doing worse in this course. At the start I went to most of the lectures but as the year went on I found it useless. She has 3 midterms plus a cumulative exam, and each one is impressively difficult even if you studied a lot for it. Good luck and read the textbook.",0
"As much as I love him as a person I don't find him to be the best professor ever. He was sweet and adorable the whole class, but when it came to actually obtaining information from the class I felt it was lacking. Overall though, I'd take a class with him again.",0
"YOU HAVE TO PARTICIPATE. Dr. Spaulding seems like a nice guy but he gets very upset if no one is participating. Requires textbook but rarely talks in detail about stories, just general concepts. Also impossible to reach outside of class and ignores the chat on Zoom. Assignments aren't too bad. Weekly reactions and discussion boards and 2 papers.",0
"Her personality likes to change on a dime, from pure positivity and joyfulness to yelling at someone if they come in a little late. Your grade counts mostly on the essays, and it isn't easy.",0
The other guy got it wrong. He changed the rules of the exam 5 hours before the exam. He was 30 minutes late the day of the midterm. Constantly makes fun of students who make mistakes. Terrible handwriting. No enthusiasm in teaching. Constantly goes over the class time on a 2 hour 45 min class that ends at 9:45 PM.,0
It's not hard I just found lecture's boring. Sparks is nice but easily gets lost in lectures telling stories. I showed up to lecture most days (bc he randomly took attendance) and just worked on other homework. He claims you have to have the textbook but it's really expensive so I wouldn't bother. You can find previous editions online that are free,1
"This woman hates herself, her life, and her job. And because of this, she will make you pay. Is it fair? No. But she will literally ruin your life anyway. So I recommend you don't take her even if she's the last professor available for the class, which is always the case with her, because no one wants to take her, don't let it be you for any reason",0
"Great prof, made the material easy to learn.  Posts notes on D2L before hand and they're awesome notes! Go to class and its an easy A.  Even though it was a night class he always made it fun and engaging.   ",1
He's a very caring professor. Being that the course I took is literature on death and dying it got quite personal and he's a very understanding person to talk to. He's very respectful and though it's a very discussion heavy class I enjoyed it thoughrouly despite the tough subject. Definitely take his course on the subject. It's worth it.,1
"Yells if you ask ?s get confused & ask a question. Wants references but tells you to make info up. Demands you to spend outside money on a suit and counts off even if you can't afford it. Waits until the end of semester to pile on so much work she can't keep up .Never gives feedback, even though that is supposed to help for the next speech/project",0
"I took developmental with Dr. Peg. She is amazing with this material. I was not interested in this class that much in the beginning, but since she loved the material and teaching it to us, she made me love it!",1
"Great teacher. Really entertaining stories. He knows his stuff. His tests are not so bad, just read the powerpoints. Don't need the book so save your money.",1
"there are only 4 tests thats it. long sections for reading. i think that he might be a good teacher for higher level philosophy class, but for a GEP class he is horrible",0
"DROP THE CLASS AND RUN. choose another professor if you must. even the highest achieving students will not pass, due to her strict grading on tests. DO YOUR HOMEWORK AND STUDY!!",0
"This guy is a joke of a teacher. He took us on a mandatory field trip that was suppose to end at 5pm, but due to his own inability to schedule properly, forced us to stay until 9pm. Other things are his over sensitivity to being challenged. He is not understanding at all either. He's gone downhill in the last couple of years.",0
This class is pretty dumb but she is a good instructor to have. Listen to her lectures and you will succeed on the exams.,1
"The professor used the class as an extension of his ego, funneling all talk through himself, using half of each class to pontificate, and belittling anyone who did not agree with him. He is easy, but nothing is worth spending time with such a character. Learned next to nothing. Very poor professor. Do not take him.",0
"worst professor I've had at UD. he does problems during class but doesn't explain basically anything he does and then just moves on. he explained things in such a confusing way and wouldn't even go over everything that was on the exam. didn't matter if u went to class or not, you'd do bad regardless unless you taught yourself literally everything",0
I love Doctor Mike! He is amazing! I am in his 1105 class and I am signed up to be in his 1106 class. I took AP Biology in high school and I did not do near as well as I am doing in bio right now. He is a great professor. 10/10 a total gem.,1
"EXCELLENT. I always sucked at math, he made sense. Explains wonderfully, good pace, always stops what he's doing to answer your question RIGHT AWAY. Do the homework, take notes in class, and look over every problem given on the Test review. Amazing teacher amazing amazing amazing. This guy is awesome. Nice and awesome.",1
Is the most caring prof that Ive had. He wants everyone to get a good mark. His lectures are very boring and he sometimes jumps around from topic to topic so he is hard to follow. Make sure you read the assigned readings because on the midterms he often asks questions about the small details. Overall.. not bad,1
"I only took one class with Naomi, but she became one of the best contacts to have in the English department. She is the best of the best- truly cares about student's success. It won't be easy to get through one of her classes without trying, and learning, but that's how it should be. :)",1
"I found Professor Abrams to be unorganized and confusing. Yes- he cares a lot about his students and the course, but that doesn't mean that he's smart or a good teacher. I regret that I did not learn very much from his class.",0
"I didn't really learn much of anything new. I learned about ""blue movies,"" trips to a mountain top in China, and to order caskets online for a discount. Analogies and stories can be a bit repetitive, but it gave me a good laugh. A lot of busy work, but not hard if you follow directions and do what he wants. Easy A.",1
"Organized lectures, but helpful if you read the book before class. The homework helps you to understand the material. All materials used in the class help with studying for the exam. All quizzes are open note/take home. Optional final and it replaces your lowest test score. If you study and do the homework and practice exams, guaranteed A.",1
"Very clear expectations and deadlines. Steve does not assign busy work or much homework at all. Exams were super easy. I honestly never watched a lecture, I just read the chapters. Definitely take this class if you need it or as an elective!",1
The most difficult math class I've ever taken. He teaches almost solely from examples. Test are impossible and because class averages are so low he had us retake each test multiple times. We ended up taking 6 midterms. He does offer a lot of outside help coming in on his own time but I still couldn't understand the material with his expectation,0
"This class is a joke. The lectures are 60 slides that you can get online after class. The teacher is really nice but will tear your tests apart. If you take her, plan to study really hard and still get an average grade.",0
"At first, I thought I liked Professor Nelson. Her lectures were good and easy to follow. But then when it came to the paper, an article review, she wouldn't listen to criticism about the rubric and didn't post a sample of what the paper should look like until the week before it was due.",0
"He is hard to understand and gives difficult multiple choice/open ended exams that most people get 50s on. He also fell behind on material. However, all the talk about his curve is true and will raise your grade by like 20%. Do better than the average and you will pass comfortably but it's still orgo, so it definitely isn't a cakewalk.",0
Took Professor Marlowe two semesters. She's a great professor! Lectures are clear and she gives a study guide for the exams. Very helpful! Definitely would take her class again,1
"Horrible! I was in Ms. Hegners class to begin and she was awesome, she got sick and asked Skelly to finish our semester for her. Half the class droped the first day he was there. Doesn't make any sence. I had an A and now I'm scared to take our final because he hasn't taught us anything. Completly political and makes rude jokes. Don't take him.",0
"DO NOT TAKE HIM. His mediocre powerpoints are useless and are not even related to his tests. You HAVE to read the textbook and practically memorize every word. Each exam consists of 5-6 chapters which is overwhelming. Tests are multiple choice, but each answer is so similar it is difficult to chose the right one. He's just looking to fail students",0
"Worst teacher Ive ever had. Absolute disgrace to IU. I had to teach the class to myself. When 2/3 of the class failed a test, she blames it on the class. She is NEVER wrong and is NEVER the problem in her mind.",0
"Cedric, sorry I mean ""Dr. Williams"" oftentimes gives ultimatums about how you will fail if ____. He also gives a 23 page instructional on a final research paper that feels doctoral level, bizarre for a 200-level class.",0
"Excellent professor! His examples in class are straight from the text book. He is very funny also, however a little antisocial. Sometimes for his exams will give you something crazy that you have not seen before.  Easy grader.  He is always 5 - 10 minutes late to class and tries to make up the lost time by forcing the class to stay 5 minutes longer",1
"Sheryl is VERY CARING! I left my sunglasses in her class room after hours and could not return that evening. She went back & got them for me! Sheryl gives her students chances to pass her class if she sees that they are trying. Be prepared to do RESEARCH papers, take quizzes each week, READ a lot. She helps students better understand the course!:)",1
"Vraimenr ennuyant comme cours. Le livre suffit pour la matiÃ¨re. Les examens ne traitent mÃªme pas de la matiÃ¨re vu en classe, c'est seulement de la logique. Ce n'est aucunement du par coeur, mais du bon sens. Elle est trÃ¨s gÃ©nÃ©reuse dans la correction des travaux et le cours est facile a passÃ©. Personne coule.",0
tough grader she expects why beyond a one-credit lab a nice person though,0
He is awful. He comes to class unprepared and shows us videos of other people teaching. He says he has office hours to help but he's just shames you for not knowing. He goes fast and writes SO sloppy. He gets flustered if you ask him to explain something again. He starts every class with a lecture about how we're all lazy and stupid and terrible.,0
"TAKE COLLEGE 100, NOT THIS BULL CLASS! I don't know how any of this will help with my nursing career. She doesn't give a rubric or anything and will knock you for the stupidest things. SAVE YOUR TIME AND DON'T TAKE HER COURSE!",0
I stopped going to class because it was boring. Still got an A and never did any of the readings or watched the recorded lectures. Most of the material is easy to just do a quick google search before writing the paper.,1
Lots of work that takes lots of time but its organized fairly well. Had some videos to help us but other than that we were on our own besides emailing her any questions which she responds to pretty fast. Make sure you look at everything she provides though as she will sneak helpful tips and extra credit.,1
Unfair.  Knows his biochem but is in denial to the fact that he is a horrible teacher.  If he's teaching it DONT take this class unless u want to fail.  Trust me its worth waiting another term for another instructor.,0
"Overall you could tell he cared about his students, but he was very strict about when we could ask questions, and got in 2 arguments with 2 different people in my class about that. To me kind of comes off as rude. Very tough grader, but there are a lot of opportunities for bonus points on the homework.",0
"Horrible professor. I wouldn't recommend her to anyone. She grades very hard on essay, and her intructions are confusing.This class was a waste of money.",0
"Thank you Professor Bartram , without your help I didn't think I was going to make it this far in college. It was a flashback, learning all those new teachings.",1
"He's the worst professor I've ever had. He is so outdated with journalism it's scary. He explains nothing - because he literally has no idea. He taught us an entire lesson on headline code wrong, then retracted his words via email telling us to look in the book. Wasted $1,600 on a class when I could've just bought a $100 book and learned more.",0
Hes good. Easy class but hes retireing soon take him when you can!,1
"I have had Dr. Maida multiple times throughout my college experience. In my opinion this is the one professor I have had that genuinely cares for her students. She has met with me late at night to make me feel better about situations. Her class is easy if you put in the work, but she is an extremely fair professor.",1
best professor I have had in college so far. he really cares about his students and will really help you understand the concepts.,1
"If you take any his courses, get ready for completely useless lectures where you will learn absolutely nothing. The most you will learn is through the prequizzes. Packback is a waste of time. He acts like a child in class. He tells us information and then tells us how he disagrees with it based on his own research. Tests needlessly hard.",0
"This is one of the hardest classes I have ever taken but I still found it sort of interesting. Dr. Hahn sounds like a used car salesman during his lectures and always wears over the top suits. He begins every class with ""I would like to begin straight away."" He writes his own book and its very expensive. You won't be able to find it on Amazon.",0
If you have her as your prof please drop that course. It's the best advice I can give you. The midterm avg for our whole class was below 50%,0
"I've had her in English and French. She's simply amazing. She's one of the sources of light in the hopeful ""lux esto"" motto.",1
"Awesome teacher, very entertaining. Lots of class time spent in space, but some teaching still done. No HW, only tests. DO PRACTICE PROBLESM! You won't get anything out of the class if you don't spend time working the book. Huray for physics!",1
"Do not recommend. Overall a very strict professor and demands a lot from the students. I was able to receive a relatively good grade in the class but only because I have to work extra hard. Lectures are dull and boring, and he sometimes mumbles and slurs his words which makes you hard to understand. Also no experience in online teaching, was a mess",0
"she is really good professor! she explains very easy, a lot of examples, fun class, mandatory attended. You have great time in class. ",1
"The reviews people are giving him on here is so inaccurate its sad. He is such a nice professor, yes he has an accent, but just sit in class & listen. Honestly, his lectures don't matter just bring your laptop and keep busy. His 3 exams are STRAIGHT from the textbook, just review the proper chapters and you will literally get an A. Its an easy A",1
"He is a great guy with lots of knowledge and experience behind his shoulders. however, the lectures are sooooo dull that i dont even know how to describe it. my tip to you guys is to focus more on practice test he gives you. problems of the same kind will be on a test",0
"Loved his class so much!  Tries really hard to make sure everyone understands.  5 papers all semester and 7 quizzes.  Makes sure everyone is involved in class.  Im taking him again with a class im not so interested, just because hes so great.  even plays basketball with the students.  Awesome teacher!!  TAKE CORRIGAN!!!!",1
"Talbert is a great lecturer. He takes a lot of Roman history and makes it very manageable for a semester. 6 short papers, 2 quizzes, 2 tests. Seems like a lot of work, but not if you keep up with names, map, progression of events as the class progresses. Grading is done mostly by TAs. Very detail -oriented tests and quizzes though. lecture heavy",1
Scott is definitely a funny man...a crazy professor type.  Better suited to university than college.  His teaching style just doesn't work with my learning style - not organized and sequential enough.,0
"He is one of the nicest guys I have ever met. I highly suggest taking his class. Yes, you will need to do work for homework and preparing for the tests, but he tells you what will be on there, easy A if you listen to him.",1
All I've learned about this class is that its not rocket science.,0
Wrote the textbook. Makes you buy the $99 software based on his own textbook to take assignments. The assignments are basically impossible to complete without quizlet since they take from specific numbers and species from the text.,0
"Shelvey is super passionate about the subject he teaches, although sometimes he emphasizes too many things making it hard to know what's vital. Take notes, read the text and TAKE THE STUDY QUIZZES ONLINE. It's sometimes hard to ""read his mind"" when it comes to assignments and it's not always clear what he wants in paragraph responses or essays.",0
Awesome teacher very laid back and was an easy class. I will admit I thought this class was not gonna be very fun but it was  and he made it very relaxed. Attendance is mandatory after so many absences it will start to affect your grade. Text book was used in class.  I highly recommend him.,1
"Garbage! Should be thrown out of teaching entirely. No piazza, no slides, nothing but his snide, long-winded lectures and demeaning jokes about any student that asks a question. I'm disgusted that I had to pay to take this guys class. He thinks he's god gift to man, constantly preening himself, but he never actually provides any value to my degree",0
"I am sure she is a nice lady, and a good prof to take on campus...however DO NOT take this class online.  There was no study guide for the terms, and we were told to basically just know everything.  I studied really hard, and I still hardly passes the course.  Was not very communicative online.  Felt I just taught myself.",0
"I had a pretty good experience with this prof. He doesn't have live lectures but ppts instead, which i like because you go at your own pace. His assignments are long but easy, the quizzes are worth 10% each but are very straightforward. I found his slides pretty decent, he also always answered my emails. 100% not the worst prof I've ever had.",1
I wouldn't wish this class upon my worst enemy!!! DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!! The grades are only from quizzes and exams. She has browser lockdowns for her exams and makes them impossible. No matter how much I studied I never received anything higher than a D. When I personally asked for help she literally did nothing.,0
"Her grading scale has a 94 and below as a B, yet she grades homeworks and projects as if a 90 is an A.",0
She's very enthusiastic about teaching. She encourages everyone. She's very respectful and she's a great teacher. She thinks outside the box. She was different from most professors and that's what I liked about her.,1

"I liked Nava Bobby as a prof for the first half of the course. However, what she expects is crazy. Weekly writings that in my opinion arent helpful, but instead very hard. If youre good at English, shes an excellent prof. However, if you struggle, I wouldnt recommend. But shes available to help a lot during office hours, which is helpful.",0
avoid at all cost.,0
I really enjoyed this class and the professor is awesome!  everything he require and expect can be found on the syllabus. You must read usually 3 chapters before each exam.  Exams are multiple choice.  He prefers not to use modern technology.  He uses the good old-fashioned blackboard. Lectures  I found very interesting.,1
"This class seemed too good to be true. The only grades in the class were three exams, in which half the points were earned by writing an essay.",0
"He was such a good prof i thoroughly enjoyed this class, he made me think about becoming a chem major. he is so good and so clear. And REALLY funny too.",1
Avoid him if you can. There's so much reading to do in this class. The class is cumulative. He uses the class time to discuss the class content and answer questions which is fine. His midterms are 50 questions and gives you 50 min to answer them. He gives out discussion assignments and they are time consuming and worth like 5% at most,0
"I failed this course once with other prof but when I take Fardad, no doubt for the choice. He makes thing easy for students to LEARN, lecture very clear, easy to reach for question on MS TEAM, debugging problem with students, flexible in submission, easy marker. ALL OF THAT saving your struggle time; that give u extra time to selfstudy - MAINPOINT",1
"Another great class where if you do your work, read, and write, you'll be rewarded with great grades.  Dr. Crews is a challenging teacher who expects a lot of his students.  Perhaps others haven't done so well, because they're not capable of focusing on college-level work.",1
"Professor Beeler is very passionate about what he teaches, but his tests are unreasonably difficult for an entry level gen ed class. He talks a mile a minute and goes off on several tangents so it is really hard to keep up with what he says and theres no other way to access the notes. I actually used to like history but this class ruined it for me",1
Her lectures are a huge help (incredibily boring though) but could probably still get by for missing a couple. The texbook is also somewhat mandatory.,0
"He's a great professor. He lectures in a very easy-to-understand way, and he's quite knowledgeable in his field. The lectures are enjoyable to go to, and the class is easy enough to do well in if you go to lecture. He assigns reading, but it's not crucial (although quite helpful).",1
"Professor Levenburg is the worst professor I have had at Grand Valley. I learned absolutely nothing from her class besides how to deal with a rude, negative professor that does not care for her students. Do yourself a favor and take a different professor.",0
A month away from final exams and NO grade update?? We have no idea where we stand in this class because he never grades/hands back the case studies we work on!  He is so disorganized and when he hands back exams he grades and adds them up at the last minute!  Always goes way over class time. Gives out study guides that are ZERO help on exams!,0
"It could be because of the online format, but I do not like the way Professor Rao organizes her class. Lectures are asynchronous and pre-recorded videos are to be watched instead. This makes it hard to stay engaged, and makes the class feel much more like busy work. There are a lot of small quizzes, seemingly due at different random days each week.",0
YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!!!!!!!!!!! STAY AWAY! this professor does not use canvas or know how to work technology. you have to buy 10 books and you have to read them all and write papers on them. and exams. she changes the syllabus every single class and passes out a new one. the inconsistency makes the class even more hard to follow. AVOID I promise,0
great prof but very hard exams specially this year winter 2005,1
Very helpful and provides very helpful and interesting information,1
"This is by far the worst professor I've ever had. She is clearly disorganized and doesn't know what she's doing. She constantly lost my classmates and my papers. She doesn't give you grades back until the end of the semester, so you have no idea how you're doing in the class. I even had to contact the head of the department to complain about her.",0
"yeah chets definitley an interesting guy, he babbles on quite a bit. His lectures dont really involve the class in the discussion though its just him talking the whole time",1
Angels was my favorite class. Miravalle is helpful and nice. He loves Mary so much and you can see that. He loves teaching and has a great sense of humor. This was an amazing class.,1
She's the nicest! She's very clear about everything! Would totally take again,1
He is very passionate about what he teaches and always excited about class. He wants everyone to do well and is available if you need help. I never thought I would like Economics until I took him. Stay ahead with the lectures; do the practice problems he gives for each day. He sometimes gives extra points on the test for attending class.,1
She assignments are quite hard but she lets you re-do them. If you email her your assignemnts ahead of time she'll give you amazing feedback. You can't fail her class unless you don't put any effort into it. Anyone in the Science program I recommend her course. She's extremely sweet and helpful!,1
Very helpful professor! He challenges your abilities in a constructive way.,1
She is a great professor. If you go to class and do the projects that are given over the semester you will be fine. She gives feedback on the Material that she thinks you should improve in the future. You will actually learn something from this class if you pay attention and do your work. She will also help you if you have problems with essay paper,1
a nutjob.  holy crap,0
Good Stuff,1
Thank you very much,1
"Tough grader, doesn't follow her own rubric. Disorganized use of Canvas. Assignment HEAVY, get ready to feel overwhelmed. Do not allow this class to discourage you from becoming an educator. Teaching is not like she presents it, she is not encouraging. Go into the class with the expectation that you will have to fight for your grade, power through!",0
Mary is an amazing instuctor. She is very helpful and has fun and unique learning games. I highly recommend Mary.,1
He is a very dry teacher and does not assist in the learning process. Most of the class will have to be self taught. You also have little warning of what to expect on tests.,0
"While overall easier than other abnormal options, you won't actually be taking abnormal psychology. Pointless outside papers that don't teach you anything. Her quizzes and tests are extremely specific, and she reads every word from her slides. She talks more about health psychology and gender than abnormal. The WORST professor I have ever had.",0
"I have Prof. J. at Ramapo College. He's one of the worst professors I've had. Easiest class i've ever had since he never shows...but you learn nothing. He's not very interested in teaching, you can tell by the way he presents himself. PP online, and always gives study guide before exams. I wish I took the class with a different professor.",0
"This is a computer class, but you have to write 10-20 page papers and use a pencil on paper tests. The homework is extremely tedious and long, and is not weighed fairly at all. For example: I spend about 10 hours on a lab (which consumed my whole day), and I only got 5 points for it. The class has 500 total points. Lectures are very boring too.",0
"This class reminds me of high school. It's so straight forward and required the minimum amount of work and effort. Professor Suggs is a cool guy and is really passionate about the topic, but I couldn't help but zone out anyway. 100% recommend taking for a gen-ed. Easy A.",1
"He is a really smart professor. His lectures tend to get boring, since they get really theoretical, but he solves difficult problems in class to make sure students are well prepared for the tests. It's quite difficult to understand him sometimes.",1
"She is so well known for her love of the LGBTQ+ community that even people in Africa have heard of: ""The Great STINNETTE"". Her ability to keep up with the times, and her academic professionalism (the way she teaches by using YouTube videos is inspiring) keeps me wondering how the world could deserve someone as dedicated as her. Chirp Chirp, Torian!",0
"Mr. Molnar is easily one of the most helpful professors I have ever had.  He was more than willing to meet with you to discuss your work.  I came into this class expecting to pull of an easy A after breezing through 161, but I was brought back to reality.  He expected nothing but your best and as a result forces you truly improve your writing.",1
He makes you write many different types of small papers on top of the essays due in class.  there is a lot of reading to do.  If you think you can handle an 8am and do the work then go for it.  but personally i did not enjoy being there.  plus he's a difficult grader!. don't recommend taking his class.,0
Goes off on tirades. The school knows about it. They allow it. Beware.,0
"If you're taking this course online, he gives you all the lecture slides + audio recordings at the beginning of the semester and you pretty much self study the course at your own pace. If you can comfortably solve the practice questions that he gives you then it should be pretty easy to score 85+ on all his exams.",1
"Great person, but not the best teacher. He puts lots of emphasis on critical topics for the exams which was helpful, but does not stay on topic during lectures all the time and relies too much on group projects for homework.",0
Dr. Moore was a great professor and very respected and loved by his students.,1
Marty is very fun. Lots of discussion in class and he's obviously very passionate about what he teaches. The class was super fun and I looked forward to going every day.,1
"DO NOT take this professor, you will regret it. I only have 350 characters to describe how bad he is and that is not enough at all. I can go on for hours, he's unfair, grades your work as if he gave you a detailed grading rubric (which he does not), if you ask him a question he can't even answer it completely and he is VERY rude. I learned nothing.",0
Very tough and strict prof. People are failing his class. He teaches different content for 2001 compared to the other profs content. His lectures are so confusing and the content he teaches is confusing so i only pickup about half of the stuff he teaches. Had a very bad and regretful experience with this prof.,0
"Took her in the summer and she was great! The enviorment and vibe is awesome in her class.  You do lots of class interaction and she makes it fun!  Do your work and ask quesitons, she's very smart and helpful.  She's also very understanding but at the end of the day you're in charge ofyourself. strongly reccomend! ",1
"I really enjoyed my ENGL 222 course and even joined his ENGL 221 class the following semester. There are usually one or two extra credit opportunities. He gives alternatives to taking the tests, although the tests are so easy no one ever uses them. He was my favorite professor, I actually wanted to do the work for his class.",1
"You have no idea what your grade is the entire semester. The class is pretty fast paced and gets a little bit difficult.    Dr. Matera is extremely nice, but make sure you attend class everyday! There are pop quizzes.",1
"She really was not a good professor. Half of the things we did in class had nothing to do with what we had to write. Not to mention we had to write a ton of articles without even learning how. On top of that, she was not helpful at all outside of class. 10/10 would NOT recommend.",0
One of the most enjoyable and memorable profs I have ever had.  I couldn't wait to get to class most days. Made me feel like I am receiving true VALUE  FOR  THE TUITION!,1
"Kidd was a great instructor.  She was funny, enthusiastic, and always clear in her examples and explanations.  Assigns a good amount of homework, but never checked it.  I probably only did 2 worksheets total the whole semester and got an A.  Just pay attention in class and take notes. The tutoring hours were def. a great experience! Take her!!",1
"This guy is THE BOMB!  You may often find yourself bored off your ass in his class, but when you tune into his slow, but intent manner of speaking, you realize he is giving you the best advice that you could use as an actor. Work your ass off outside of class, and you won't have a problem coasting by IN class",1
"She is moody and needs to work harder in making course content more clear.  Some days she will be nice, others she is mean-spirited and ornery.  She seems to not like her life, students or faculty very much.",0
Great class.,1
I had her for FYE so obviously it wasn't difficult. Really nice person but she does talk very low. Her FYE class seems to be easier than some other professors.,1
learned more from watching videos online. poor lectures. very disappointed that i had to pay for this class. I wouldn't recommend a fellow student take a class taught by this dude if my life depended on it. horrible experience.,0
"He's definitely very tough, but the class in general is brutal. I learned a lot and really liked his teaching style. Attendance isn't mandatory but I think it's necessary to do well in this class. His tests aren't the worst thing ever but the time limit makes them difficult. He also doesn't give partial credit for short answers, which is annoying.",1
"he is extremely helpful, always being so nice to student. knowledgeable with different financial history, stories during lecture. You can know more about how the content relate to the real world! One of the best prof in UW!",1
teaches how every teacher should teach,1
"This professor was one of the most condescending people I have ever met. After asking me what I wanted to do after graduation, I said, ""I would like to get my PhD, do research, then teach."" He responded by telling me that wasn't realistic because I'll probably want to get married and have children (I'm female). Funny, didn't seem to stop you.",0
"Excellent professor! He made everything very clear. He's clearly knowledgeable and is very helpful when you need him. He'll like you if you come to every class and participate. You can easily get an A if you do your readings and go to his office hours for help. He'll make you a better analyzer and please don't use the verb ""to be.""",1
"Dale seems very insecure.  He is not good at communication, and very afraid of honest criticism.  I don't think he really knows who he is, himself.  Time for counseling!",0
"Labs are so easy. He gives you a chance to get 135 marks out of the 100 you need. I had 97 after the first 100 and didn't need to do the last 3 labs. There are a million ways to calculate uncertainty and you don't always know which one to use. There is so many hand-ins the TAs dont read too closely, just check that you get the main points",0
A really great professor who has great stories and is able to make anything she speaks about interesting and easy to understand as she is passionate about what she speaks about. Just make sure you go to class and read the syllabus.,1
Honestly has zero consideration for her students and is cold hearted. She does not care about you and is unwilling to make any accommodations. I can see why most students do not respect her. She doesn't bother teaching you and gives you horrible grades for no reason. She is one of the longest lasting profs at UNBC and it is time for her to retire.,0
"Many people ended up dropping from this class for a number of reasons. Some of those reasons being very unclear grading criteria, as well as having an unreasonable way of grading many assignments, and just being very unpersonable and hard to approach.",0
"Just an awful class, if you want to see how to do a class wrong this is it. None of the work that he goes over in class has anything to do with the tests. Thompson is very lazy when it comes to being a professor he puts an absolutely the least amount of effort anybody could possibly put in. All of his tests that trick questions",0
Time for Retirement!! Class could be useful but NOT with Thistle as your teacher...... ,0
"explanations need more work, spilt personality, not approachable",0
When I took the Course a few years ago. We only got a text from Seyhan Ege. Needless to say that i tried scouring the internet looking for practice problems. This pales in comparison to what my friends who went to UBC got. I found the course to be deficient. I think that Doctor Mars is not the best person to teaching.,0
"She seemed very nice to begin with, but as the course went on she seemed to lack interest in us students. The tests were hard and often had an average of D. Students who took the course as a GPA booster were shocked at their low marks. She rarely had answers for the questions posed in class. I was highly disappointed.",0
"I would not recommend her. Tries to cram all lessons into a 50 minute class, and therefore couldnt answer any questions class had. She is horrible at getting back to you (e-mail), and it would be more helpful if she could load your grades online too keep you up to date with the class. She was not that bad, but could be a LOT more helpful.",1
Don't think that you can put in minimal effort when it comes to Mielke's class! He is a wonderful professor but expects a lot from his students. He is one of the only ENG profs at Truman that truly challenged me to become a better writer and critical thinker. Don't be afraid to argue with him and come prepared. He doesn't coddle students.,1
"Nope Just say no. Disorganized and he doesn't even teach, all the teaching is done by TAs. Maybe his other classes are good but not this.",0
"Dr. Meyer's lectures are heavily focused on his personal life, trauma that he has been through and his accomplishments. He has a confusing mix of talking about the terrible things that have happened in his life as well as the things he has accomplished and is proud of. Pretty annoying to listen to, though he is a nice guy.",0
The absolute Worst! Taking this for FA5? DON'T! RUN AWAY FROM HIM AND HIS TAs! He is awful to talk to and his lectures are extremely long mainly because he wants to make it difficult to understand the main points. Never worked with a professor like this and would go back in time just to drop this class.,0
"Mr. C is a great guy, but the worst prof. His grading criteria is unknowable, he gives no feedback, and is incapable of answering questions. He gives no extra credit and gives NO PARTIAL CREDIT. If the answer has anything wrong with it, no points. I made the mistake of not listening to people here. Don't make that mistake. You've been forewarned...",0
"One of my all time favorite teachers - she is very good at getting students to think, rather than just memorize, which is rare in science.",1
"ANTI MASKER, dropped class soon after first class started.",0
FOR ME THE BEST TEACHER IN SWC !!,1
"Sophomore Spring for mechanical engineers at UD is already full of the worst professors the department has to offer. However Roy still manages to stand out as the worst Professor of all time. He is extremely disrespectful to students, most of the class accepts the fact that they will not learn anything and someone get assigned a random grade.",0
"Adjusted class time to start 0.5 hr later, causing the class to run 30-60 min overtime often. Over the term, students contacted her with questions for assignments. Never received responses 95% of the time. 100% NO COMMUNICATION up to assignment deadline.s Promised samples/explanations never supplied. Heavily biased. Inability to be dispassionate.",0
For someone who always taught online you would think she would be good but this was ridiculous,0
"Loves what he does, he may even make you interested.  Very helpful and fair.  Not a slacker class, but it won't take too many years off your life either.",1
"Figen is amazing, and definitely my favorite teacher at Grand Valley. While the work load is very heavy, she is very understanding and is a fair grader. She gives out a ton of extra credit, which helps take some stress off the work load.",1
"First, I wish you could rate 0. I hope you have a good internet connection. You will be teaching yourself through YouTube videos. The lectures are all over the place. His writing is illedgeable. He often makes mistakes in the notes. My personal favorite he skips steps by taking shortcuts, but he doesnt tell you ï¿½ï¿½. His test reviews are misleading.",0
"This is a great prof, she gives you all that you need to know in lecture, if you take notes in class you should to really well in the class. she is funny and is interesting, i was told not to take this class by a ton of people but she really made it pretty interesting, if you are going to take phi 101 take vandenberg for sure!",1
Awesome teacher! Take his class,1
"Mary Ann Bush...this woman is awesome, great professor, knows the material inside-out, really interesting lecturer with great stories, fun and entertaining, pretty easy and interesting class.",1
"If you aren't an athlete or in his fraternity, he doesn't like you.  I switched to a different teacher and got an A.",0
"Abrams is by far the worst economics professor at UD. He does not care about his students and is very bad at explaining things. To be fair he does know a lot about the subject, but is terrible at explaining it. The material is hard so have fun teaching it to yourself. Has office hours but they are almost as useless as going to class. Terrible.",0
We had 3 papers 2 of which were about the 2 books we read and the third was a research essay. The midterm and final is just an essay and short answer. She had us do Canvas discussions so don't neglect those they really matter! She cares about you the student more than anything so if you have an issue getting an essay in or something just email her.,1
Awesome professor! Very sweet and understanding! Interesting lectures. Fun class. Highly recommend!,1
"His class was boring, the work was pointless, he didn't grade anything until the last week. He didn't assist when asked for help. Getting an A was easy but not rewarding. Would not recommend for anyone who wants to further their skills.",0
"I was SO excited for class this class and quickly had my heart broken by the first three assignments that I did not pass. I subsequently dropped the class to save my GPA. She expects me to have 9 hours a day to slave over a forum question(s), which are the actual worst. I have never seen a more unreasonable class at the U of R. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.",0
"Not good in teaching. Book won't help much, you will have study from the lecture. If you get average or above average in the exams you will be fine. This guy doesn't care about students. but he curves at the end.",0
He is the worst teacher I have ever had in my two years of college. His lectures were extremely dry. Noone could even function in his classes. He can't teach at all and he told his the class would be fun but NOT AT ALL. People just sleep and drool in this class. He was very unclear and unhelpful. I am never taking him again,0
"I can't believe this guy is still teaching. I had him in '88 and he was a grumpy, poor teacher then.  He delighted in tormenting students...",0
"Unfortunately did not adapt to the online education process as well as other professors - and it definitely shows little effort was shown to do so. His lectures are pre-recorded (with only additional audio in the slides) which made it difficult to engage with. Learning to adapt with this style was the most difficult part, in my opinion.",0
Give's great feedback to each paper. Customizes your homework based upon your individual learning needs.,1
"Engaging, knowledgeable, articulate, and funny professor. Frequently takes the class on hilarious tangents relating to peculiar medical phenomena that occur on such a mundane basis. 4 Midterms (one of which is dropped), 2 lab practicals (reasonable in difficulty), one research paper, and a final exam. That said, you will need to study well for this",1
Thinks she's funny,0
He's an incredible professor. He posts very detailed writing materials to help you tune your writing skills. The questions he posts for the readings helps you read texts critically. I'm very taken aback by my sheer luck of having such a great professor to take English with at MUN!,1
"he is really a terrible professor. His class is boring but not very difficult. However, he won't give your marks in the exam for some ridiculous reasons.",0
I was sick one semester. I had pneumonia and could not attend to class one time and this teacher at a final exam told me that if I would take a class again with him I would have to attend to all my classes even though I missed only one class and other students missed a lot more. This teacher is a disgrace and thinks highly of himself.,0
"Shes awesome, accessabile and understanding. Tests are to be expected based on the study guides she provides. The textbook was written by herself so its a great way to actually learn and comprehend the material",1
"Hanks is a wonderful teacher! He is interesting and he really tries to make sure everyone gets the material. If you are interested in Linguistic Anthropology, you HAVE to take him! PLEASE do yourself a favor and keep up on the reading! The readings are not that interesting but you NEED it to write the papers and you'll take FOREVER catching up.",1
Such a nice and caring professor. The material isn't easy but she prepares you well for exams and tries to make lab as enjoyable and stress-free as possible. Definitely take her!,1
She is not the most friendly of professors. She is helpful and wants you to learn the material. The only thing I did not appreciate was that she makes you do a verbal presentation that is 100% memorized. Then she berates each student on what they did wrong in front of the entire class which I found to be very inappropriate.,1
"took this course during spring 2016, for being a 3hr lecture twice a week it wasn't too bad. it was an 8am course, and she still made it enjoyable! lots of reading for the summer course, no exams only papers and an assignment due every class period",1
No communication & not a lot of feedback.,0
Simply the best nursing instructer I've ever had! Professor waller cares about her students and wants them to succeed. She's so good at explaining things that we thought the material was much easier than it really was! It was an absolute pleasure to be in her class. You'd be really lucky to have her. She made nursing school enjoyable!,1
shows interest in students who know how to draw already. Do not take with a full time schedule (i.e. 12 cr or more) She demands alot for an intro drawing would not recommend her to others (unless you love strict professors by all means.....),0
"Took Media Law online. Zero interaction with the professor all semester. Your entire grade consists of 4 tests. However, if you do the reading it's extremely easy. The only thing I studied was what each legal case was about and the lowest grade I received was a 94. Though there was no interaction, I really don't know how else to teach this class.",0
"Best professor I have ever had, although the tests are quite difficult.",1
You will not learn anything from this Prof. Some people have said he goes out of his way to help but that is only because he tells you shouldn't go to the help center. Sometimes he will repeat whole lectures multiple days in a row. His class is only possible if you know about JAVA before you take it. (textbook is helpful but prof never read it),0
"Although Professor Gill is very nice and approachable, I didn't really enjoy having her as a prof. She can be hard to understand at times and she puts paragraphs on her slides and reads directly off of them. She makes pretty easily.",0
"As long as you do the study guide he provides which requires you to read the book you will pass! Make sure you make notes on everything for the study guide vocab because quizes are timed! Overall, I would take Torres again. Not an easy A, but very passable!",1
Took about a week to receive an answer back from her through email. She doesn't upload grades consistently. Textbook problems: she would assign wrong page numbers and then not even bother to fix the problem. Essays aren't too bad because most are about a page.,0
his lectures are never boring and he explains perfectly!,1
She always took attendance. She has annoying dry humor. Make sure to answer every question in the essay questions. She grades hard.,0
"A worthless teacher for a worthless class. Out of 21 lectures so far, he's canceled 5 of them. I'm sure there will be more to come. The entire grade for the class is based on 3 exams - our first two exams have consisted of 2 10-point questions each. He is truly proof that having a PhD means absolutely NOTHING.",0
"He is a good prof and he is very passionate about the subject, the Baby Human series he showed in the class was hilarious. The assigned reading was too long and I think the TA was not fair in grading the papers, I almost spent 30 hours on the last paper and got a B-! I guess he is not going to teach any classes any more.",0
"Le cours est bien en gÃ©nÃ©ral, il aime beaucoup parlÃ© de son expÃ©rience, c'est sÃ»r que dÃ©fois c'est long, mais c'est quand mÃªme un cours de comptabilitÃ©...trÃ¨s satisfait en gÃ©nÃ©ral!",1
"Pretty bad, although not the worst Calc 050 prof. He can never stay on topic and has very weird sayings which can really get on your nerves.  We were once talking about Euler's number and he got off topic on how ""Euler is from Switzerland- just like Roger Federer, and he plays tennis.  Who watched tennis yesterday?"" Stuff like that.  Watch Out!!!",0
Needs to assign less and explain more,0
PRETTY GOOD,1
Professor Burman made this class easy. I had previously taken 102 with Brunemmer and failed but took this class again with Burman and got a 3.9 She offers a ton of extra credit so show up to class to know when she announces them. She is always available to help. Lectures aren't mandatory except for the 1st week of classes. I used the book maybe once.,1
"Doc Pok is a great guy. He's hilarious and genuinely a nice person. Unfortunately, he's a terrible professor. He doesn't do a great job explaining the material. I would not recommend his class to anyone.",0
Takes away participation points for texting your mom during class. Doesn't ever give reasons for why she gives you the score you get. Inconsistent grader. Please don't take this professor pls.,0
very interesting teacher.enjoyed his class,1
"I have been taking so many classes with professor Christine and she is one of the best instructor you could find in CWU. She is hilarious, caring and inspiring. A lot of reading is required, but she also gives out a lot of extra credit opportunities. She is always available even outside the classroom. I would recommend her courses to everyone.",1
"Ray is the easiest prof to take for 2200, easy A+, just show up. Memorize all of the answers to his practice quizzes to 100% all the tests he gives. Gives bonus marks for attendance and pop quizzes but they all start at the beginning of class so don't be late. All assignments are done in groups, but are super simple.",1
"This teacher physically couldn't be any more boring. She doesn't understand the basic concept of a gen-ed. The tests will feature random factoids, that don't show up in the textbook nor the lecture slides. You are punished for studying the review sheet that she issues. This is stealing.",0
"She was one of the most confusing teachers I have ever had.  None of her assignments made sense, and when she tried to clarify, she confused me even more. Her grading made no sense; it seemed like she pulled the grades out of a hat and assigned them.  She definitely played favorites and seemed to ignore some students. I do not recommend this class.",0
"She has a very thick accent, the things she teachers doesnt make sense, I would not recommend this class for anyone that has a hard time understanding math like me",0
I took this class this semester and it was very easy. I showed up only for test days. If you take the quizzes multiple times before a test then you'll do fine on tests. He also offers a lot of extra credit so its an easy A class.,1
"Heffernan is very knowledgable and insightful, not to mention constuctively critical. He goes off on tangents, which only serves to make the class more interesting. He realizes that life is only a series of tangents. Heffernan is not only a great poet, but also a man from which much could be learned",1
The epitome of a red chili pepper!,1
"Tolich is the best intro-stem professor I've had yet. I actually enjoyed being at his lectures and I felt like most of the material presented to us, was formatted on the test in a way that we all felt prepared for it. His practice midterms are really helpful and he even put a few on there. Study and show up !",1
"I would never in my life recommend this professor to anybody. Was supposed to be a conversation class, and instead it resembled a mix of a theatre and lit class as we had to read a poorly written coming of age book and a terrible mystery drama written by Szeps herself. We got lectured on theatre constantly. Total waste of a semester.",0
"You have to pay attention in class, you can get by without reading but you won't do great. He ALWAYS has office hours you can use and will make time if they don't fit your schedule. He teaches fast but will slow down and answer any questions if asked. Tests are hard but reasonable. I used to hate math but now I love it. Would definitely take again.",1
Dr Lopez teaches her class like youre one of her micro colleagues. She forgets that youre in the learning stages. Shes not approachable. She says that shes there to help but not really. Who says to their students right before an exam that I expect everyone to get below 60%. Not very encouraging. Pick another teacher. I dont recommend her,0
"She is very nice professor always listen to students problems. Exams will cover what she taught and are generally easy. Bonus points and open book tests so that students wont fail and learn as well. Overall  Easy course, Good Learning and Best professor.",1
"Do not take this class unless you already know the material beforehand, He does not teach, he sits at the front and types in a bunch of code and if you are not sitting in the front row you cannot hear him. Best advise is to take this course at another college.",0
"It's hard to imagine any improvements that could be made to Pacyga's class. For an intro class, he worked his way up to the complicated stuff slowly so that Philosophy can be understood by just about anyone. Gives easy 5-question quizzes. 3 exams (40 T/F w/one essay each). One caveat is that you must be a good note taker and study for the tests.",1
"Asking a lot from the students, maybe too much. It's true that he knows his stuff very well and he's a world-leading autority on many subjects, however he is a bit old-fashioned.",1
He is not very personable and makes organic even more painful to sit through. I also feel like he's not concerned with his students doing well. I'd recommend taking organic over the summer somewhere and avoiding him if possible.,0
"I really liked the content of the class. It was online but she was really nice to us because of coronavirus. I had to move and there was a lot of stress, plus I had other work and class demands that piled up. She cared about us and went out of her way to adjust the class to minimize stress on us. I appreciated it!",1
"Melissa was very helpful and very accessible outside of class. If you uploaded an assignment and it did not show up on Blackboard's end, she reached out to you to let you know so you could email it to her! Some teachers would penalize you.   Group project. Head's up.",1
This professor is so hard if you do not know spanish and to top it off he is a prefectionist. If you miss an accent or mispell somethings its wrong. He is boring and his class is to hard.,0
Nice guy. Fairly easy class. Put in decent effort and you're okay,1
"Professor Ramsey has no communication skills what-so-ever with her students. She has a poor attitude and I don't like being snarked at when I ask for help. Overall, the class is easy... But communicating with this professor is a chore.",0
Professor Susan is responsible and the best instructor ever. Her lectures are amazing. I learned a lot from her in every aspect. Take Care!,1
Worst Professor at the Citadel. Boring as watching  paint dry. Uses every second of class for terrible lectures. Makes everyone uncomfortable by asking gotcha questions. All academic background with no real world experience. Avoid him at all cost. Little man syndrome run wild.,0
Tuff prof but very helpful.  Explains things really clearly. I learned more in one semester with her then any other class.,1
Dr. Johnston is one of the lab TA's for this course and she is so lovely and caring for her students. She also teaches a forensic anthropology course at OSU. She'll respect you if you respect her.,1
"Great guy, tries everything to make students pass, teaches you everything for exams and gives extra credit. Go to class and you'll get an A",1
A prof that tried really hard to make stats interesting. Online midterms were pretty good just study for those. The exam was really easy if u studied.,0
"Not prepared for classes, seems to only read off a powerpoint. If asked a question which is not on the powerpoint, she is lost and continues class without answering the question. She expects you to know the material without ever being taught it, and she is by far the worst ""teacher"" I have ever encountered. It's a shame she is the only biochem prof",0
Ever have that teacher that thought that they were an english major even though they literally knew nothing? Ever have a teacher that tries to make a class that is completely useless seem important? Well this is exhibit A. ,0
"Professor Cramer is the kind of teacher I could only hope to be. He has a theme with every lecture and is incredibly articulate and thorough. I feel spoiled taking his class and I don't want to take Art History with any other professor. The tests are difficult if yo don't study, but he's fair and easily approachable.",1
disorganized,0
She is a breath of fresh air. She is the sweetest woman you will ever meet and her class is really fun and great if you're trying to get into photography. TAKE HER ASAPPPPP,1
Just try your best to don't choose this instructor. Loved design classes until i choose him. Class is easy he makes it terrible. He is a nice person and a good engineer but not a instructor. Marek if you ever see this just give up. You been teaching for 15 years and i am still saying this. I would give you a 0 but website won't allow me.,0
"This class is the most unproductive one I have ever taken.  I have learned nothing, but it's easy to pull a solid grade.",0
Just DO NOT DO IT!. spare yourself the time and money. I felt like I was getting ready for my board exams...,0
The class was full of long assignments and graded activities with unfair distribution of credits. You will have more than 10 assignments  activities together each takes more than 1 week to finish 1 quiz and 2 exams. He didn''t teach. He just made you work. Don''t know how something works Find out on your own. His feedback was ambiguous. ,0
"He manages to cram a lot of material into one lecture, but if you have interest in geology then you'll be ok. Physical Geology is the typical rocks and such, but the minerals used are interesting enough. Environmental Geology talks about individual events. He has several tests, but he has guided notes as well that match the tests.",1
"Funniest prof. on the campus, a lot of ppl don't like him b/c they think he expects too much, but if you just listen to him, he will tell you exactly what he wants you to write on the essay parts of the test almost word for word, again he's a hilarious guy!",1
This class is largely lecture based. Lots of writing involved. Instances where topics discussed in class had no relevance to actual course material.,0
Great introduction to grad school!,1
"Like Robin Williams in ""Dead Poets Society""",1
"This was a really helpful class, and one that I needed for my degree. I've taken Dr. Swint before and knew he was a really good teacher but I usually don't like online classes. It worked out pretty well though. Dr. Swint is now the head of the political science department but he still took the time to help out.",1
"I would not recommend the online version, as it was very much self-taught.  Expectations for assignments were not clearly communicated and it took several weeks for him to respond to my email questions.  Additionally, Dr. Quirk's comments on my papers seemed condescending and not constructive, and his rubrics were not his complete expectations.",0
"East to talk to, genuinely cares about your performance.",1
I had professor Mathis for poetry and I had a solid B the whole semester(because only grade were the daily worksheets ) until our first test 12 weeks into the semester she grades unrealistic on the paper I got an F because I didnt meet the page requirement. When I went back to redo it I was literally 2 sentences away getting an A in rare,0
"The WORST TEACHER EVER... Her PP are outdated. She does not like when you ask questions or to go back on the slides. She is so monotone, boring and rude. No manners at all. She gets a satisfaction when she fails students. She teaches irrelevant information. I do not understand why IVC has not solved this this problem.",0
"lol i cant believe people still take this guy, no wonder hes trying to improve his teaching, just to let you know - i have a 3.8gpa and finished mcc with highest honors. this is the one teacher i dropped and im so glad i did. this class was dreadful. what a shame. take wathen or nagarajan iyer",0
Really rude to students on piazza and in office hours,0
"Professor Cho talks very fast during her lectures, and if you miss one you will be lost. There are 3 exams and they're worth about 70% of your final grade. Her lectures are long and difficult to understand. I don't recommend this class to anyone.",0
"Not a terrible class, but way harder compared to all the other COMM profs. Her lectures were stupid considering the homework readings went way more in depth - but she checks attendance. You'll do a lot of reading, only to take weekly quizzes that are worth just 10% of your grade. 1 solo presentation and 2 in groups. Rubrics are sometimes unclear.",1
"You either hate her or love her. either way an entertaining class. You learn to laugh at yourself and at her quirks...she also has the most experience you will ever find in a prof in canada who is a playwrite. i loved it and am takin a second course, but mostly for the humor of it all.",1
Make sure you have a Japanese to Engrish tlansrator heading into this class. I seriously used to drink beer in her class.,0
"Don't take this class. Listen to me. I've taken upper-level CS and Engineering courses. I've been through hard classes. Do not take this class. First exam. 70% of the class got an F. Curve? Nope! This dude doest care. I promise if you take this class, your GPA won't make it. *-> Create your schedule around not taking this professor. <-*",0
this guy is a JOKE of a professor! don't ever take this guy!,0
"I was NOT a fan of Helms, although he was an easy A, he went about his lectures with questionable statements... somewhat questionable statements about women and race. I stopped going to his class after the first month. All of his tests are online aka google and group test sessions are your friend. I do not recommend taking from him.",0
Shes very reasonable! Do your reading though!! You can tell she really cares about her students and the subject. Made me enjoy history even though Im a science person,1
"Funny guy. Very knowledgeable. Great at explaining the concepts. He's taught this course many times, and he's good at it. I would highly recommend taking the course with Brecht if you can.",1
Very easy to work with. Understanding and clear,1
"Bonzo is fantastic. I got an A- in this class, but I worked hard for it. Difficult class, but Bonzo is challenging and thought-provoking. Make sure to stay caught up on the reading.",1
"Jenneke is less of a class and more of a commitment, but it's very rewarding. She's willing to work with you along the way as long as she can see you're actually trying to achieve your goal. One of the best instructors I've ever had.",1
"Rare combination: understands advanced math concepts AND can explain things to people who aren't great at math!  Amazingly helpful during office hours.  Patient,  respectful, and non-judgmental to questions, responds well to feedback.  Genuinely wants students to succeed. Study guides for tests.  Tests reflect HW and class content.",1
"The worst professor I have had at CMU! He doesnt do examples, give study guides, or answer questions. He refuses to learn how to use the SPSS software which we have assignments on. He says everything is in the book and that's the only way to learn. His lectures are completely pointless and he is rather rude to students in the class.",0
"This course is definitely useful for someone who knows how to code. If you are not good at programming or you just know how to print out ""Hello world"" you should skip taking this course. But if you are a good programmer or java developer, fasten your seatbelt, you gonna have so much fun in the first part. The second part is paper discussion.",1
His lectures are entertaining. Exams are strictly essay so you have to really know the material.,1
"Everyone says Lash is terrible, and it's for a reason. If you search for meaning in this class you can find it, and people are overly cruel. But that's because no one likes being talked down to while their time is being wasted. Lash is a bad teacher. The content is whatever, but he presents it horribly. Replace him.",0
horrible. horrible. HORRIBLE.I've lost all of my love for the italian language and a good amount of sleep- i have no time to be doing the amount of work assigned. SAVE YOURSELVES- please take spanish.,0
"To start the semester, we had 15 students, an average size for an upper level history course. In the end, 5 five were left. I stayed because of the challenge, and he does challenge you to become a better historian. He grades tough, takes off points for absences, but if you study hard you'll be fine. Not an easy class, but I'm glad I stayed.",1
"If you are smart, you are his best friend.  If you have trouble or need help, you are screwed with him.",0
"If you're in RTA you'll have plenty of time with this guy and you won't regret it. I know everyone has already said it, but I just had to as well, he's such an amazing professor and you're bound to do well. He's great.",1
Awesome online prof!! She is super organized and makes everything super easy to follow. One quiz a week and 5 exams with questions straight from the book. highly recommend this course,1
"Never take PSYCH101 online course! Tons of reading, assignment and projects. Prof Ennis was mostly not able throughout the course (answered 1 or 2 questions on LEARN). Contents were much harder than expected (as 101).",0
"Plain terrible. She's very knowledgeable about the topic but is next to terrible at explaining the material. She talks about her personal life way too much and goes on tangents about her life, rather than the topics we need to learn. Expects way too much out of a level 100 class.",0
"Well I did learn a lot and enjoyed most of the readings. We had three papers and an optional final. All of class is just one big lecture with a small group of students that always participate. One time he was heading towards a biological determinism argument (crazy I know), and I think that was the highlight of my experience as a sociology major ha",1
Donnelly is very smart and brings up very good topics during class but she is a horrible teacher. Nothing ever gets graded so its almost impossible to figure what grade your going to get. It seems like at the end of the semester she just throws a grade out based off of how much she liked or disliked you.,0
"Professor Stevens knows what he is talking about better than anybody, but he just expects you to be the same way. He solves questions without really explaining the work behind them. I am not alone in this as the class averages for the past two exams have been 59% and 61%. Meanwhile he boasts about his low averages and teaches us nothing.",0
Best Prof Ever!,1
"easy but his structure of the class is confusing and unorganized. you literally are completing online h/w course on your own, it grades you automatically. Due dates to assignments were all over the place and he made it difficult to find them and just wants to look at the syllabus. Theres more to teaching than stating to look at the syllabus.",0
Heard from a couple of classmates that she can be kinda rude. Tests are filled with trick questions but you often won't have enough time to catch them. It's only lectures and readings. Not the worst class but not engaging at all.,0
He is the funniest teacher I had  I wouldn't doubt taking his class again!!!! Best Teacher Ever!!!!!! ,1
"Overall Professor Perez is pretty cool. He made the class concise and clear, but I guess it helps that I had him for discussion. There is plenty of reading, so if you are one to skip the readings, don't take this class.",1
"can be moody and unpredictable, but, hey, she's a poet. and a darned good one at that. it can't help but rub off unless you are in a coma",1
"Professor Aoki needs to be more clear on what he wants on his assignments before handing them. Make sure you do the readings for his quizzes and go to his office hours when you fall behind, he is helpful when you go. I wish he had more prepped presentations. He normally writes on the board and sometimes it can be hard to read his writing.",1
She is very unclear with her assignments and expectations and not terribly helpful in clarifying these.,0
"At first I didn't think that this class would be hard, I was wrong. 81 percent failed his class. He has a quiz every Friday. All short answers, you must be specific or they get marked wrong and spelling HAS to be correct. The test are ALL short answers too. You if plan on taking him make sure you study, and know all the material weeks before.",0
"This course attempts to give humanities students technical programming skills, which is something generally unfamiliar to humanities students. Matt is a helpful and supportive instructor; even if you struggling with the technical assignments, he is always glad to help you. Attendance and participation s are a must, as this is a seminar course.",1
"The material is really interesting and it was pretty cool when we got to have a phone conversation with the author of a book. He's not too hard, just keep up with the reading.",1
Makes math extremely hard. If you want to know how to do the problems you need to rely on the book. He doesnt give extra credit or let you make anything up. He will also grade things very tough and doesnt care how you do on anything. He is also hard to contact at times and will not reply on occasion. Seems like a nice person but not a nice prof.,0
"Easy online course, answered all my emails, very glad I took this class online vs in the classroom.",1
Her lectures were scattered. Her notes were on a Microsoft word document with over 30 pages and only get through 15. Assignments were confusing and didn't give much information on what was expected (3-5 sentences of direction) and when asked for further clarification about the assignment she would just repeat exactly what the description said.,0
I think CSUB should be embarrassed to have her as the head of the department. She doesn't communicate for it being an online course. She will not respond to emails. She doesn't give feedback on assignments. She takes 3-4 weeks to grade anything. Takes a long time to turn in grades at the end. She leaves you hanging on if you will actually graduate.,0
A great Prof.,1
"Such an amazing professor, hands down! She covers a lot of material but all of it is interesting. There are two papers, midterm and final. Gives extra credit! Take her and you will not regret it. Easy A!",1
"I hate organic chemistry lab and this course was just about the worst. The TA's are so confused as to how to calculate theoretical yield. Then you are forced to go to lab during the pandemic. This course could've been online completely rather than hybrid. We still would've learned. Even if you have Covid you still have to go to lab, very unethical!",0
"Professor Schlick is great, but she can seem dry until you get to know her. Make the effort, talk in class, go speak to her in office hours, and you'll be golden! She really makes an effort to engage with students in class, but you have to initiate it if you want her to know who you are.",1
"Dr. Tatum was one of the best professors I have ever had. i grew up in a non-religious family, so i was nervous when it came to the Christian Scriptures class, but he made it very enjoyable and fun to learn about. You do have to do a lot of reading and notes, but I feel it prepared me for tests. I ended up taking him for heritage as well.",1
Professor Keaney is a nice teacher who helped me to appreciate Chaucer.,1
"This class was the hardest one I have taken, Never missed a class and still got a low grade. Her tests were hard to comprehend and as well as the lecture. She gave lots of examples on the test that were not explained in class. Also, the majority of the class were lost on the material. I will recommend you to get another professor for this class.",0
"Nice lady, not a great teacher. Very hard grading on the only two test essays. Homework load was never a problem, but class discussions were typically very dull and lacked inspiration.",0
"If you show that you care, show up to class, and do the work, Rachick will be an excellent teacher for you, no matter how bad at foreign languages you are.  As a Russian native, he speaks English very well and offers many insights into Russian culture and history throughout his classes.  I will be taking my third semester with him this coming fall.",1
"You will not learn anything from Mingyang's class. She is very confusing, and her exams are impossible. She will help you with the hw if you go to her office hours, only plus.",0
"Class is really not needed because she covers the material from 335 all over again. Then at the end of the semester she goes over some new stuff, which can be covered in a few days. She requires attendance, has two projects. The way she words things is very unclear, therefore ask questions in class, she will give answers in class.",0
"Prof. Tortolani is the best! She makes learning a language fun and interesting. There is a ton of work and assignments can be challenging, but by the end of the semester I felt like I learned a lot!",1
"I do not recommend this class at all!! No organization at all, two assistants and one professor that makes things even harder to understand. You will learn on your own, do lots of homework in Person, have long zoom meetings every week unless you do extra work on Pearson. DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR!!!! DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS ONLINE!!!",0
"Compeau likes to experiment with students and often loses his professionalism. He will tell students that they will not make it successfully, and others that they will, to see how it makes them react. He is not trustworthy at all. He worries more about himself and his career and salary than the students in his class.",0
Dr. Hall is the best Professor ever. Her lectures are never boring she makes them so clear. Her love towards CJ in general is very inspirational. I loved being in her class and will definitely take another one of classes down the road. In her class take notes and do the reading and you will get the A. I know I  did :),1
"Although Eric knows his information and loves Ecology, the lectures can draggggggg on. He was kind of sloppy during lectures, ie always forgetting stuff and would start late. Quizzes are pretty hard and there's been found to be some mistakes on them too. He's okay, but I'd take someone better imo.",0
"This guy is very boring and a little odd, but the class isn't hard.  Just do the work and come to class, and it's fine.",1
"Darwin is a great guy. Dry sense of humor, can be pretty dull in lectures, but he's a great guy who really cares about his students and loves the material. But for some reason, his exams are significantly harder than any of the practice problems or the text book problems. He curves which is nice, Definitely possible to get an A, but its not easy.",1
I learned a lot in his class. I learned much more than I did in Hoving's class in Math 110. Talk about a disappointment!,1
"Not only is Professor Dattolo an excellent professor,but if you need extra help he is always willing to meet you outside of class and spend the time to help you. He is a very special professor and I highly recommend him.",1
A really sweet and funny professor. Lectures are informative - can go on tangents- but I actually enjoyed listening to him. I learned a lot about biology and morality in the healthcare industry that I found fascinating. Midterm and Final are hard but its a biology class. What do you expect? Curves almost everything and is very lenient.,1
"Professor Makover is probably one of the worst professor I have ever come in contact with, barely explains stuff in class and runs over it very quickly with no examples. He refers to our knowledge and compares it to 4th and 5th graders, even though I have heard him say multiple times that ""Our knowledge is probably better than his.""",0
"I have her now and I want out. She's nasty with her students and gives a tremendous amount of ""busy work"".",0
"Extremely rude, especially when you ask for help. Doesnt explain anything well. Doesnt allow enough time to complete the 2 part exams. Class is easy though, all the assignments come straight from the book.",0
Stay far far away.,0
"Good teacher but gives a ridiculous amount of homework. Try 5-10 assignments a week; oh & there are 5 papers. Additionally, many of the assignments seem like busy work that she doesn't even grade based on effort/quality. If you do poorly on an essay or miss an assignment, it wont matter bc there are so many assignments to balance out low scores.",0
Worst prof I've had yet. hes not afraid to openly criticize the class. his reading quizes require you to be extremely specific. I read and take notes and I have yet to do well on one. I wish I hadnt taken this class. Prof is awful!,0
"Her tests and quizzes are extremely hard. Even if you improve and try hard at the end, if you don't reach certain points, you won't pass. She's not student friendly, imo. There's no extra credit. She write/drew notes on board until the class end. This class need 100% attention or gg. Won't take her class ever again. Not a fun class.",0
"This is a class that you have to set aside time to study, prepare for the next lesson, and review the previous one. Professor Musik is brilliant, she expects a lot from her students but if you just give it a try, you'll be good. The homework is mostly online, you don't need a physical copy of the textbook, and very straightforward and easy.",1
He is a terrible teacher do not take class,0
"Do not take this class if you are a history major. The man is bright, however he thinks like an engineer and not a historian.",0
"As an online class: His exams aren't that hard (using the textbook and notes). He's very engaged with his students and will answer any questions you have. My only complaint is sometimes his lectures are veryyyy slow and drawn out, and sometimes he gets confused and makes a lot of mistakes.",1
"Lot of material class moves quickly took it over summer session. The final is cumulative, which is 12 chapters. Literally 12 chapter in 1 week to prepare for. What kind of dipsh*t makes a cumulative exam for a 300 level course?",1
"Miller is hilarious and very clear. He is an incredibly knowleadgeable person, and so his lectures are pretty dense. His tests are very long, with 3 essay questions. Howver, he provides extra credit opportunities and makeup for test points. He is hilarious.",1
"Mrs. Ferguson is the best teacher for commendation and a ""can do attitude"". She makes everyone feel like public speaking is possible. I took the online hybrid class and I TOTALLY recommend it! She grades fairly on the final product, but she will give you feedback if you turn your assignment in early so you can perfect it before the final draft!",1
"Awful, kind of knows his stuff but cannot teach it and is all over the place, going to class was a waste of time.",0
"He calls out students but takes it too far (made fun of kid obviously on the autism spectrum); brought god into several lectures; screens white, predominately cishet male films w/ offensive stereotyped roles (Lottie in Mildred Pierce for ex) but never brings that up. Go to class, and you'll get an A (BME major so def not a lot of work/effort 4 me)",0
Gerd knows everything and then some. (Note to 1st years: do not try to debate theatre/drama with this man as he will defeat you easily.) You know exactly what to expect from Gerd and what he expects from you.,1
I feel So Smart after taking this class and I learned a lot! Mr. West is so sweet and caring. He may use strong word sometimes that shock you and gets your attention to teach you about the real world and make you more worldly/street smart. I felt like I was playing Puzzle games like thinking how to solve sudoku or writing computer program equations,1
"Boring, boring, boring!",0
He's amazing!,1
Trina is an excellent professor. She is extremely patient and she is good at explaining the topic. It is not necessary to attend class because she doesn't grade you on that but she is very good at explaining the notes when you're in class so reviewing the notes for the day by yourself might be a bit confusing. She is really sweet and understanding.,1
Very clear lecture+ useful slides+ office hour,1
Makes it tough for a 100 level class.,0
"James is a laid back teacher who randomly goes on tangents, repeats lectures, and forces his personal opinions on students.  I had a background in photography.  If you're a beginner he grades differently than if you've had experience.  I would not recommend his class.  His photography work is dull and does not look professional. Expected more.",0
The class doesn't allow much flexibility as the criteria consists of 3 modules where it covers 3 topics per week. . The class is practically on auto-pilot as the lectures aren't even taught by her mostly. Just having some insight from the professor herself post-lecture would be great. Read the syllabus as there is a warning for taking this class.,0
"She is a sweet, aged lady. She does have her moments where she'll raise her voice when there's too much noise for her to concentrate. She's willing to answer any questions you have inside and outside of class. A few random attendance checks with learning catalytics. Lots of practice problems and quizzes. If you know how to solve for x, you'll live.",1
"I didn't like her. The class itself was fine, and she teaches ok and makes students get involved in art, but she doesn't come off as being very nice or caring about students. Trying to get a recommendation fom her is a nightmare.",1
"Likes his religion, and his whale done video.",0
"My favorite professor at UP, he has a huge amount of knowledge that he loves to share and is passionate about it. You won't get to all of the material in class and you have to have questions but a great learning experience",1
"One of the worst and most unprofessional teachers out there.  Over-estimates her importance; no technical knowledge; complete waste of time; very biased towards helping females over males in a male dominated field.  Still, despite all of this, you cannot fail her course as she is more concerned with making students like her.",0
"Dr. Smith does assign a lot of homework, so if you dont want that in your life, pass. But, the homework was for the most part incredibly easy and took about 10 minutes every time. Her lectures are great and she likes to have the class talk in her lecture. She has exit slips every day, so be sure to show up!",1
Has been messing up lectures for so long that I have not learned a single thing. Better luck learning online if you can find anything on his topics...,0
"DO NOT take this class as an 8-week class. The class has way too many papers to be crammed in 8 weeks. Good class, and amazing professor, just not in 8-weeks.",1
"Well if you have to choose between Macintosh and Majumdar...haha enjoy your semester! lol This guy goes through the book. He gives notes, but if you pay attention you can just follow exactly what he is doing in the book. And his examples come from the book...doesn't add much. He is boring and sort of weird.",0
"AVOID Her notes are very confusing and when you ask a question she sends you a website to find the answer. She tries to trick you on tests instead of giving you obvious answers.  The project is a compleet waste of time and she could care less about the progress of students. On the bright side, there is always a cruve on the tests bc everyone fails",0
"I wish I was making this up; you essentially can't study for the course. There are no take-home-practice problems, you can't redo the questions from class because the data provided becomes inaccessible after the class, and the course notes -- while somewhat useful -- can't save you, because the course is largely problem solving based. Hard marker.",0
"The easiest class I have ever taken in my entire college career. 1 presentation that is extremely easy (and I am terrified of presenting) , 2: 3 1/2 page papers, and 3 tests or 4 tests. I highly recommend this class because you come out of it getting more knowledge from him, and the text book he uses costed me around $12. Also a WI course as well.",1
"The most boring and monotone professor ever. Super nice guy, but hard to stay awake in his class. Tests are crazy hard but he gives extra credit if you come to lecture. Also, his graduate student, Muhammed Ameen that teaches lab is the worst lab instructor ever. Speaks little english, doesn't make assignments clear or concise and very boring.",0
worst prof ever!!!!!,0
"Not clear with the syllabus. Does not hand back graded assignments. Skips through power points and says it will be posted on blackboard but never is. Is not willing to listen to students talk in class, kind of speaks over them.",0
"Great professor! It helps if you have taken a class (preferably Theo 1001) before with him, because a lot of information repeats itself- you have to learn the same lists and bible passages for the exams.",1
"Dr. Vohs gives great notes, like a high school teacher.  However, he is hard to reach and offers little help outside of class.",0
"Excellent Professor, fun in class, teaches from experience, very open for questions and down to earth. He has been one of the best professors I have ever had! I recommend this class to anyone who is interested in criminal justice and policing",1
"She is very nice and helpful, though, she gives hard tests on everything you do for the class. Go to all the labs because you get graded on assignments given. Cathy makes it hard on herself and the class with all the random assignments she gives. She keeps you the full 2 hours and enforces this by giving extra credit.",1
Professor Flynn is by far the worst professor and person at SCAD. She was extremely rude when responding to emails. She didnt teach the class what so ever. She is a tough grader even. I have only had experience in one drawing class so if you arent a strong drawer you will fail the class.,0
So many iClickers. They really pile on the hw and exam questions are nothing like the hw. Had to get 3 paid subscriptions for the class. Forced discussion posts through a paid service that could be done on canvas for free. Lectures are no good so just do the hw during class and learn from the internet.,0
She is the single WORST prof I have ever had! She is scatterbrained and contradicts herself. She is rude when asking questions are asked and literally just rants about plants and climate change. Grading criteria for midterms is nonexistent and she expects you to be an expert on the subject even though her lectures are utterly useless. Good luck,0
DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS WITH THIS PROFESSOR! This is the worse professor I have ever had. He sits behind the computer and writes in the same 2x2 section of the board. When he erases the equation he barley erases it and then writes write over it . Very unorganized. his office looks like a hurricane went through it.,0
"had him 20 years ago, still follow his career and see him when possible",1
"she's great! very clear on info, very interesting and she is soo nice you can tell she is interested in what she is teaching. quizzes are a bit difficult but as long a you read the book and go to class you'll be fine",1
"The hardest professor you could possibly have for any math course. Do not take this class unless you belong in courses taught at Carnegie Mellon or MIT. Incredibly difficult problems for homework and calls us ""greedy"" when we tell him we want to actually understand everything about the homework.",0
"Hardest class I have ever had. You need to understand the material, not just memorize it. He wants you to do well and his TA is available for questions. Records his lectures and has reviews for each exam. Can't slackoff in this class!",1
"She is one of the laziest teachers i have ever had at any university. Her ""lectures"" are just her reading random points from the book and telling us what the test questions will be. She puts absolutely no effort into class and then is confused as to why none of the students want to participate. I would avoid her at all costs if you want to learn",0
"Amazing and caring professor. She makes sure that every single student understands the lesson; she leaves no one behind. Explains the material in a way that's understandable, and even though math isn't my cup of tea, she made the lesson enjoyable. 5 stars",1
Not a good professor in my opinion. Classes are long and boring. Tough grader. Hard to talk to. Avoid if you can.,0
"Bill is a decent guy and does a good job of teaching the material. However, he thinks very highly of himself and is prone to going off on irrelevant tangents during lectures. Ultimately, you either love him or hate him. Overall, as long as one reads the book and shows some interest in the material, this class is a relatively easy A.",1
"If I was told I was allowed to slap one person without consequences, it would be this damn woman. Her class is boring, she doesn't teach, and she doesn't care about her students at all.",0
Fields is the man! Show up to class and take notes and you will do great on the tests! I bought the textbook and never opened it once because his tests come straight from lecture. Overall my favorite professor at JMU. I got a B doing very minimal work.,1
Amazing class and an amazing professor. Took this class online and Professor Wolfsen is on top of her game. Modules are well prepared and clearly laid out to make online study smooth. Insightful relationship information. The finale (last lecture) was inspiring and powerful. Live discussions and ability to interact with classmates is available.,1
"Three hour class that can be done in 15 mins. The professor skips over the slides, which I could be doing at home. Papers are simple but he is a tough grader for no reason. Does not provide constructive criticism for you to do better on the next paper. Asks questions about your opinion, however if it is against his opinion then you are wrong.",0
"Take his class!! He will turn around the usually dull topic of expository writing to be a very fun class, seeing that he is hilarious! Very down-to-earth and helpful when speaking to you about essays. Easy extra-credit quizzes.He's like your favorite college buddy, only more informative in essay writing. You will laugh + learn better writing skills",1
"He's obviously very smart, but he shouldn't be teaching intro chem classes! People told me to switch out and I should have listened. He covers things very quickly, especially considering most students in his gen chem classes haven't taken chemistry in a while. He makes you feel stupid if you don't get a concept, and is a tough grader.",0
She is an awesome teacher and very funny.  She kept class interesting and fun and it was enjoyable going to class.,1
"pretty good prof. friendly and engaging with the freshmen honors students, but expected a lot from us. he knew a lot of names by the end of the sequence and showed more concern for our individual success than any other prof i've had. the material (esp his tests) was VERY CHALLENGING. INTENSE.",1
"Dr. Scordilis is very knowledgeable on his subject matter. There aren't many tests and homework has a low percentage value on you final grade. About a third of the class drops within the first two months due to the normally low Test One scores, but, if you go to his office hours, he WILL help you get a better scores from that point on. ",1
dedicated guy,1
"Professor Keeling is very nice and pleasant. That being said, she's not a great teacher. She asks for something in a paper and will then take off for it. She also puts her views into what she teaches. And she holds class long virtually every class period. It's really annoying with a six o'clock class and I'm trying to get dinner.",0
"Boring, boring, boring, boring, can't stress that enough. She explains concepts clearly, however I was not able to keep my attention focused on what she was saying. Everything she says, including her ""jokes"", seem to be rehearsed. Her voice is so monotonous. Better take this class with Fugelsang, who has much better ratings.",1
"Brilliant professor, encouraging adviser.  Lectures are clear and insightful.  Be careful to keep up with the classwork though.  His papers and exams are tough.",1
"This class is very hard and it kinda seemed like he wanted us to fail. The unfair thing was that he taught us something 1 day before the final, which is wrong. I think he should have thoughts about the class and how would the students feel but he kind of tortured us all the way through.",0
"Go to class to figure out what the point of the section is and then just go to the tutors. Honestly, the tutors should be getting high wages as they are the ones who make understanding possible. Interesting and intelligent man, but terrible professor.",1
"He is unresponsive to questions on piazza, doesnt post solutions to practice questions for assessments, refuses to post past finals with solutions, rushes through the material every lecture or leaves questions blank without even caring we understand or not, never curves marks when they are low, doesnt post solutions to any practice problems",0
New to Audio but really enjoying it so far. Good online.,1
"Okay she is hard (like Exams, labs, her grading) For any small mistake she will take points off She curves and gives extra points for sec (little bit helpful) Make sure you pay attention to what she does in class and writes on the board similar prob on exams) oh she flys throughout slides yet u need to know everything for exam cracks same jk #x GL",0
"This is a professor I wish I would have avoided. I can't understand a word he mumbles or read a word of his scribbles. Even if you do get the conceptual stuff down, apparently you can't do well on the tests without a specific financial calculator. It looks like I'll be retaking this class next semester and I will definitely find someone else.",0
Hard to understand and extremely boring. Picture a slightly overweight Ben Stein but from India!!!!,0
"He is more interested in talking about his past work than about actually teaching the class.  Don't bother asking questions, you won't get a direct answer and the answer you do get will be riddled with condescending or rude remarks.",0
"Dr. Lectka's course was amazing. While there is no textbook, and the material is more difficult, it was highly rewarding. His lectures make the material graspable, and the concepts you learn will apply to all fields of chemistry, and even made adv. biochemistry courses much easier (my peers who did not take this course did not feel same way).",1
"Dr posas was a very hard professor. His class was mandatory & even if you were 5 minutes late he would shut the door on you & tell you ""sorry"". He would only help if you went to his office. For a 200 level class, you think it would be easier.. We had more work than my 4 other classes combined, too many assignments. Should be a writing intensive.",0
I'm taking his class as we speak he a great professor... he knows his stuff sometimes the lecture are boring his midterm are hard and so his is paper.. but he gives you all the material for the paper !! would i take him again maybe not !!,1
"Here's the thing about Pederson. He's extremely attractive and he is constantly trying to get students to discuss in class. But if you don't talk you lose participation points. And his tests are really in depth and difficult, so if you don't know everything you will fail. His class is really freaking difficult.",0
A knowledgable and thoughtful man.,1
He is the worst teacher i have ever had. He gives you way too much work and he preaches all the time. If you dont want someone telling you every MWF that your going to hell dont take his class. You learn nothing... his class is good for sleep.,0
"The course was relatively easy, but confusing at times. He does not post grades in a timely fashion. He changes the projects and due dates during the course. Some assignments do not cohesively link together compared to the goals listed in the syllabus. Be flexible.",1
"Bruce is the most incredible professor I have ever had the pleasure of working with.  He really knows his stuff and really cares about you knowing it too.  He is unbelievably understanding and helpful.  If you prove to be a good student, he will prove to be a great professor.  I 150% recommend this professor.  Make a point to take him!!",1
"If there is any way, you can avoid taking her class, do yourself a favor, and do so. She is a great person, but she needs to improve her teaching style because online teaching is not working at all. She is very unorganized, and you will be wondering when are the due dates for assignments and test all semester.",0
She is glamorous as ever but not as helpful. She will help if you go to office hours but she tends to talk in circles. I really wanted to like her but I don't feel like she explained what was necessary. I will say she attempted but it wasn't the best.,0
"He is a nice guy, he really cares about students and you can tell he has passion for what he is doing, but the grading system is just tough and your grade depends only on exams.",1
Great professor with a great personality. He really knows a lot about psychology and he is very passionate about it. Tests are hard if you do not study but if you do you will be fine.,1
"Dr. Anderson is by far my favorite professor at LSU. He's a friendly and hilarious guy, and he will go out of his way to help you. I'd take him again in a heartbeat.",1
I graduate from this program in 2014 and just had to come back to mention that 3 years later and I still resent this man and his attempt at teaching.,0
"She's lenient with grading the lab's but when it comes to quizzes they are just horrible! She would give you a random species that you have no information on a few days before the quiz and then expect you to become an expert on it in a few days! Her lectures are just horrid, she usually joins and talks about how hard her second job is mostly.",0
"Yatin is actually a really funny guy and extremely intelligent. However, he needs to realize he teaches at Grand Valley and not Harvard. This class is extremely difficult. Tests are made up of 8-10 questions and account for most of your grade. Heavily based on your ability to do algebra rather than financial equations. Great guy, terrible teacher.",1
Was very helpful and provided fantastic feedback to assignments. Class was great and she made it fun.,1
Unreasonable grading,0
"He is overall a nice man who really cares about his students, and he actually made the materials funny for us to understand. However, even if I put plentiful time into this course doing tens of readings and memorizing the stuff in his lectures, still got NP for this course. His sample questions literally mismatched the tricky exam questions.",0
"Meryl is not a good teacher. It is that simple. Ruined my interest in English which is sad considering my major is Journalism. Very judgmental, and very sarcastic.",0
"helpful, clear and concise.  material he teaches is difficult, but he prepares you well.",1
"Tough class, but interesting.  I liked the class - many did not, but many were not used to college and what it takes.   Flow could be improved.",1
"My whole life i thought i couldnt math. I took steinfort for 98+107 and absolutely loved it. I built history with him and look forward to his class. I sit front row and always ask question. With math, you have to put the time in to get good results. I see it inspires him when i understand new material. He wants his students to succeed. PRACTICE",1
"Exams, and homeworks are based on nonsense and insanely hard, and every day of class has nothing to do with any other day. Demos are fun/useful but aren't the 'meat' of the class. Project is easy as long as you start on time. He's a smart guy but an awful teacher- useless lectures and generally rude, esp. to girls. Worst ENG prof I've had at BU.",0
He is so boring and will talk for the whole class time. Everyone falls asleep in his class.,0
"Mme. Celli is the best! She's so sweet and laid back, she made French so interesting and enjoyable that I'm planning on pursuing it as a minor. Participation is important.",1
"Barb is the best professor Ive ever had. Yes, she definitely makes you work for it but outside of academics, she is the most caring instructor Ive ever had. If youre going through a rough time or anxious about something, she is there to assuage your fears and overall, she just brightens your day with her uplifting words. Im so glad I had her.",1
"Great teacher, very friendly, easy to talk to and interract with on a personal basis. he really lets his students explore art in their own styles rather than trying to teach a ""correct"" way to do everything.",1
"He isnt as bad as people make him out to be but at the same time his in class teaching isnt helpful. Your grades in 3 tests, a final, and homework. I passed by working in the homework until I got a 100 and I took time to learn the material outside of class. I was 1 of 2 people who passed my class",0
Dr. Crawley is a great guy and professor but at times goes off topic during lectures which makes them hard to follow. You are expected to read the assigned pages from the textbook prior to class and will have a quiz on the readings every class. This does help retain the material and assure that you are keeping up to pace. Don't miss class!,1
As a DSS student Dr. Mirbod was really patient with me! She is a great professor. I took her during the summer 2020 (COVID) and she works really will with remote teaching. If you do your homework on WileyPlus and participate in class or on zoom and you will do Great! Take her! But make sure you do your work and you will pass her class. Good luck!,1
"Joseph is outdated, 240 is unreasonably weighted solely on exams (cumulative final is 50% of your grade), assigns an insane amount of reading and problems, and emails you EVERY SINGLE DAY just babbling on because he has no life. I took his online FIL240, which is VERY dry material, & the pace and his expectations were not worth finishing my minor.",0
Strongly recommend his class,1
"I have taken 3 semesters of music history with Professor Sweeny. His course isn't hard if you put forth the effort, but I found the book and his lectures to be incredibly boring. You don't need the book to pass, I still received a B without it. Be involved in the lectures, it makes the class go by quicker and less painful. He is a really nice guy!",1
Quirky guy who wears cowboy boots and turquoise belt buckles. Definitely knows his stuff! Can't stress enough how important lecture notes are tho.. the entirety of the exams is from class. GO TO CLASS or else you'll miss so much. Probably could get by without books. He talks about them in class anyway.,1
I know that I could not have gained a better understanding and appreciation for organic chemistry if it was not for Dr. Malkawi. He always takes the time to answer questions thoroughly and fully explain organic chemistry concepts in a very effective way that is easy to understand. Dr. Malkawi is an outstanding professor!,1
"Do not take if you are not a geology major/have an interest in science. Lockwood is an amazing professor and a nice person, but her class is unrealistically hard. The tests are insanely difficult and they are based off of application of thousands of vocab words.",1
"She is such a great lecturer. She shows her personality & makes the content fun to learn. She doesn't take attendance but she teaches so much information in a day it'll be hard to catch up. There's three exams, a paper, and a final. She does drop the lowest test grade, which is helpful. She has helped me look forward to this class. I recommend her!",1
"He had no course website, no feedback, nothing. He was totally unorganized. This prof sucks. He might seem nice but cares not about his students. Horrible do not take classes with him! You will get &&**& up",0
"Reads way too fast, expects you to keep up and understand what she is doing.",0
"While he is passionate, Dr. Keele's lectures often run late. Participation points only count if you answer clicker questions correctly. Anxiety students BEWARE: Keel will stare you down during tests. The midterm/final are VERY stressful as they make up most of your grade. I received an ""A,"" but at the expense of my mental health.",0
"Lectures are fun to go to, however I don't recommend taking this class with him. Makes it harder then it needs to be. Assigned group projects that include two 25- 30 page papers. Thought I was going to get an A in the class. Ended up with a B- and have zero idea how that is possible.",0
Professor Martin is amazing! He is easy going and also easy to come to with issues. There is group work and he is always willing to help you ask answer questions. He is all about learning and growing in his class. Definitely buy and read the textbook,1
Wonderful teacher. This is a rough class but you actually learn a lot whereas some teachers just give you an easy A. Boys in the class were disrespectful to her and got called out for it like she's not going to tolerate that. Be respectful and she is a kind woman. Test MC are hard and random. Make sure you memorize her test outline!,1
Her class is extremely interesting.  I have learned so much from her.,1
"Professor Boone is one of the best teachers at SLU. She expects a lot out of her students, but at the end you will find that you learned a lot in her class. I highly recommend!",1
"Hes a nice guy but teaching is not his strong point.  He said he was ""trying something new"" and gave us 500+ questions to put into a notebook. Each question required multiple answers. Barely any review for exams and often gave us wrong chapters and pages to study.",0
"Dr. Parkerson is a true asset to the CSCE department.  He maintains healthy research activity without cost to ths students; i.e., he still teaches class well and responsibly with plenty of lecture notes.  He is always available during office hours and extremely helpful.  Good advisor.  Classes require the students to learn, but not burn out.",1
I really wanted to get something out of this summer course. The problem with him is that you cant understand what he is saying. Grades on blackBoard are in abbreviation and i really don't know what he is talking about during the class. The book is your only mean of help for this class. I honestly would say get another teacher.,0
"He lectures by writing on a chalk board and that's it. He cracks jokes but they are not funny. You cannot write on his test or he will take 5 points off, a couple test were 30mins for 50 questions. He was teaching the bones in the hand wrong. I dropped his class this semester, class averages on his test range from 47% to 59%. HORRIBLE INSTRUCTOR!!!",0
I love her. She is a great lab instructer who explains things really clearly and is just plain fun to work with.,1
"Excellent professor. Attendance is not mandatory, but can be helpful. If you do the textbook readings you will be well prepared. I highly recommend this course",1
"Professor Carlson is very smart, but he jumps around in lectures which makes it very hard to understand what he is talking about. He does not use prepared notes, so you are expected to take notes based on what you understand about the topics. I would not recommend him if you struggle with science classes.",0
"One of the nicest professors I've ever had. Lectures are really laid back, environment is really nice, but you still learn things and are given resources to learn on your own if need be. Very open to helping you at office hours, as long as you are willing to cooperate and put in the tiniest bit of effort, you will succeed.",1
She talks really fast and doesn't give you much time to take your notes. She is very easy grader on papers I have made 2 A's an 1 B. She is willing to help you. She isn't very good at checking email. She will also tell you that you have to address the emails or else she wont reply Her weekends are her personal time so don't email her then.,1
"She is passionate about teaching, and is very knowledgeable in the topics. She is willing to explain and help students.",1
It was all Greek to me. When he teaches he expects you to know everything there is to know about Finance when the class is supposed to be an Introduction to Finance. He made it harder than it had to be.,0
"I nearly have panic attacks writing those quizzes! 5 minutes for them is awful. If they're not some careful calculation, they're a definition instead; which you CAN'T FIND ANYWHERE. It's unacceptable that these are worth 40% of my mark. I nearly did better on the midterm. Only 25/30 quizzes are supposed to count, but he should definitely drop more.",0
I would say that she is one of the best professors in the CDDS department. She provides great insight into her responsibilities as a speech-pathologist and has contagious energy and interest into the subject matter. Tests are half multiple choice and half fill in so be prepared to study  for that. 4 tests in total.,1
"Reeves is by far the best accounting professor I've had. She explains concepts extremely well and only lectures on what you need to know. Her lectures are actually interesting and she loves it when you ask questions. Multiple attempts on homework, 2 attempts on quizzes -she takes the highest score. Pay attention and do the homework, it's an easy A.",1
Very funny prof! Take any of his classes-- you will really learn a lot. Plus he is cute.,1
She is awesome. One of my favorite teachers at Valpo. Very helpful. The class is hard but she helps whenever you need it.,1
"CS245 is very disorganized and filled with error, less examples were shown in lectures, assignments were usually posted late, try your best to avoid his section.",0
Honestly this guy is the worst professor I have ever taken at UD and I've had some bad in the past. He is not a nice person and teaches NOTHING that are on his exams. All he does is stand up there and flex how rich he is. You literally need to memorize the textbook in order to do well. DO NOT take this professor - there cannot be anyone worse.,0
"He didn't even give us lecture notes or powerpoint slides, so I basically had to write out everything he said during the lecture videos, which was extremely exhausting. Not only that, but he made one of the assignments due during Reading Week. Avoid this prof if you can.",0
"She definitely knows her content and how to teach... she's just so dry. If the course notes weren't so terrible, no one would attend the lectures. Preparing for assignments and exams was a nightmare because she asks questions on such assessments that appear only once in the lecture.",0
"Elzinga is legend here at Mr. Jefferson's University. Fantastic lectures, both interesting and informative. Tests are a combination of lecture material and reading material, so going to class and doing readings are both very important. Class was not overly challenging, even though I had an abysmal TA. Highly recommend this course.",1
"His tests were rather easy, but contained random bits of information, not the major concepts and ideas that you would assume. -WORST- speaker I've ever had. He rambles about previous lectures for half of the class and then goes off on a whim and manages to get nothing done. Overall, useless professor, easy grade.",0
"Nice lady, easy tests, teaches fairly well.  She's a little hard to understand.",1
"Overall professor Mattox was a great guy, I knew almost nothing coming into the class and he was always available for extra help and loved answering questions. It is clear how much he enjoys teaching and it radiates to the students, highly recommended.",1
"Professor Soljan is kinda boring. He takes a long time to discuss one piece of literature and wanders from the topic a lot. For an SWS class, it was low on writing; there are only 3 papers and the last one counts as the final. He is understanding but very opinionated. Show up to class and you will pass.",0
I am a full time student and employee. I have test anxiety and this professor is patient. He will let me sit in on other lectures if I miss any. As well as is flexible with letting me take tests later on(and I haven't even told him about my anxiety). He is very nice. He isn't one of those professors who takes a bad day out on you. Very proffesional,1
"My experience was that there was too little clarity or teaching of concepts. Again again we had to struggle on our own and a lot of students just ended up failing because they felt disconnected and could do nothing about it. He picks his favorites and assumes others too lazy or and do not want to put in the work. Its not hard, its the teaching.",0
"Ms. Kim is not the best professor to take for calc. She has a very strong accent, which makes it difficult to understand her. Even if she didn't have the accent, you still wouldn't be able to understand her. Do yourself a favor a skip this professor",0
"Nice lady, but DO NOT take the class. Even if its the only finance class left open don't take it. It's not worth it, half the class fails her tests and theres only 3 tests with no curve, only two homework's so theres no way to get your grade up. She also made sure to remind the class about the withdrawal date...",0
"Tomasi struggles with simplifying his teaching styles for a 100 level class. His exams are extremely difficult and he does not provide a study guides. Lectures are long and boring, I find him very monotoned. He does offer extra credit throughout the semester because if he didn't all his students would fail. Class average on tests were in the 60s.",0
"This is an actual college class, and if you still think you're in high school, I would suggest waiting to take his class. He has high expectations for his students, and he also loves to give pop quizzes. He is definitely my favorite teacher even though he is tough. He doesn't have a filter, so grow up and quit being a bunch of babies. He is great.",1
Professor Nevitte's class was my favourite during my time as an undergrad. I learnt so much and actually had the opportunity to reflect on what I learnt during lectures. He prompted me to learn more and expand my knowledge. He is also quite approachable and is interested in seeing his students grow. I would definitely recommend the course! ,1
she is really nice and helpful. she makes class interesting snd fun.,1
"Stacey is a sweetheart and her class is very easy - you don't really need to show up or do the readings as long as you work hard on the papers. She is a fair grader and her grades will reflect the effort you put into your papers, which are the only grades. Listening in lectures is not important since there are no tests. Like a grandmother!",0
He goes over everything step-by-step and always willing to answer questions. I wish that he taught every math course that I need.,1
"You will be in a constant state of confusion if you take this class. She's nice but pretty useless when it comes to teaching. The only thing more pointless than her lectures are the assignments. She loves collaborative essays which are terrible at helping students improve on their writing skills. Unfortunately, she takes attendance every day.",0
"Heres the truth...Class averages are consistently below a 70, tests are ridiculously hard and unfair...I had to change this to pass/fail and still am struggling to pass ..STAY AWAY, ITS NOT AS EASY AS IT SOUNDS, YOULL THANK ME",0
"She is a comp. 1 professor. Comp. 1 should not be hard to pass, especially at a COMMUNITY college. She is a weird grader, very technical, and will rip your essays/summaries to shreds. You are warned.",0
Not helpful. Would start talking about one topic and then would pause and discuss a completely different topic in the class (makes it very difficult to make notes).,0
He is rude and harsh; very negative,0
"This was a relatively easy class. Overby is pretty funny, in a weird way. You learn to like it. The tests aren't bad as long as you study. He doesn't take attendance, but you really need to go to class. He doesn't use the book or powerpoints, so you really need to be in class for the lecture.",1
"Literally the worst professor I ever had. I was going through a difficult time personally and asked for an extension on a specific assignment. He told me some people weren't meant for school and that I should drop out of university. This was in my third year! Never, ever again.",0
"Though Hayes is clear and good at articulation, I find him to be extremely offensive as a professor. His views on religion are one-sided and very biased. He tries to convince students of his points of views during class. Aside from that, he has an interesting but hard class.",1
"Bulson is awesome. No textbook, just articles. He taught a lot of real world knowledge, which was cool. Very understanding and easy to talk to. Interesting class, pretty easy grader, highly recommend!",1
I took a few courses from her. She is great. She doesn't spoon feed you but she is very helpful and understanding if you go to see her. She knows her stuff and expects her students to work hard.,1
Great CF teacher. Take her class if you get the chance. Lots of reading but interesting texts,1
This guy is boss.,1
"Horrible, inconsistent in his direction. Penalization for ""last minute"" posts... Coming from a design major with a passion in this field. I would highly recommend another professor. There are MUCH better in this department then this horrible professor.",0
"Her lecture style is all over the place, she goes over simple concepts over and over without reinforcing the hard concepts, and she wastes a lot of time. She doesn't post the answers to assignments and doesn't let the TAs give us answers. Her assignments are difficult and she doesn't give part marks most of the time, especially on tests. Beware.",0
"Great prof, dry sense of humor is good for the tough course. He's a genius programmer, if you need help, ask him! He will explain it. Some people think he makes students feel dumb for asking questions, but he doesn't, he cares about questions, so he will answer them the best he can.",1
spends way too much time on meaningless stuff,1
Professor McLane-Iles was fine. She covered the material in an understandable way and would try to answer any questions the students had. You can tell she is passionate about what she is teaching.,1
"Thought at the start that it would be more of an opinion based class. If you aren't in his line of thinking by the end, your grade will show it.",0
Exellent.,1
Dr. Write is a brilliant professor and a great mentor!! He is always there if you need extra help outside the classroom. Dr. Wright truly does care about psychology and his students.,1
"Lots of enthusiasm.  Excellent knowledge of subject and examples given are awesome.  The only professor that graded things quickly.  14 easy, 10 point assignments to help your grade.  Offered extra credit.  Made classes fun.  I would take her again.  Best marketing instructor at EMU.  Stellar",1
"Classes were OK and informative.  Professor's delivery was fine.  However, students with less knowledge about programming and theory might find the classes difficult.",1
"The issue with this man is that he lacks the ability to connect with students. During office hours, he is unwilling to help, directing students to MLC. During class he is literally talking to the whiteboard . His explanations may be be good at times but lost in his delivery. He is a nice person but teaching is not the right job for him.",0
Worst teacher to ever take a class with. Wants his students to fail. He needs retire asap,0
Owe my career in academics and a lot more to Dr. P. You don't see old-school profs like him any more. Dr. P. is a prof that that haven't lost his passion for teaching even the first year courses. Hardest earned C in my life but spellbound the entire 6 years studying with him.,1
"I took professor Zaiens Fall 2019. I liked her teaching, she was very helpful and informative in English. The only bad thing would be that she takes forever to grade exams so you really don't know what you did right and what you did wrong.",1
Dr Wilson is by far the worst professor I have ever had. She requires that your life solely revolve around her class. She assigned 400 question LearnSmarts due in 48 hours. She gives only 20 minutes for a 20 question quiz. She refuses to answer questions in class and calls you unprofessional for asking questions. She cannot explain things at all.,0
"He is a tough teacher, but probably one of the best. His subject is important, if you can't understand algorithms then you need to pick another field of study. If he thinks you don't care, he won't think twice about failing you. He has a heavy accent but his one-liners are worth it. Hard grader, makes you work for a C but you learn the subject well",1
"He sometime has bit sense of humor but his lecture is boring. He speaks too fast that he swallow words. his test I think mostly are memorization based such as fill the blank or multiple choice.  TOUGH MARKER. JUST PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT HE SAID, then you'll pass.",0
"You meet one time a week in class, and she assigns group work and expects the group to work on it together, when we only meet once a week. Only grades one group members assignment as well, so if your group members don't do the work properly or at all, you can be penalized for their laziness. Assigns 2 part exams in one class, so not a lot of time.",0
"Awesome Prof. top 2 or 3 at UVM in my opinion. Her class is always engaging and she is very kind and understanding, however you must do the reading to be part of the class. random quizzes and attendance.",1
"I never once got a 100% on any of my papers, would only get up to 95%. Other students in the class had the same problem. Tough grader, lots of papers. Hes good at communicating, but if you want an A, you probably wont get it.",0
Lecture is pointless but go anyway and get attendance points. Lecture/lab really bring up your grade so make sure you do well on those. When in doubt...go to office hours. She is a terrible professor but I went to office hours once to discuss my grade and ended up with 10 points added to my last test grade.,1
I love her she is the best professor I have had,1
An absolutely AMAZING TEACHER. She is one of the most wonderful Professors I have ever had. She will really inspire you,1
"Explanations make everything VERY CLEAR. Her examples are very helpful with assignments. Lectures are a little boring, but all cs lectures are",1
"He isn't a bad guy and makes silly jokes often but he can't teach. It's difficult to understand him sometimes because of his accent. When he explains a concept, everything is more complicated and makes the entire class confused. Most of his exams and quizzes are open book, but I swear he makes them harder because he allows you to use your book.",0
Professor Bonner is a great teacher who guides students to understand all of the material. He would not leave anyone behind and would answer any questions people had. He is easily the best teacher i have had. I highly recommend you take him if you get a chance!,1
I am glad we did not have to pay for a textbook. Class is a good class for students like me who did not know much about Cybersecurity. The GENI labs were not easy so i am glad we could workin groups for them and our final poster. Got the most out of the class discussions -the online modules were ok,1
"Autumn is one of the best professors I ever have. She is smart, talented and helpful. She lectures the major components and the big picture for each chapter and expects you to explore the details on your own. Exams are a little challenging but great curves can improve your grades from a 70 to 100.",1
"Her art class is great, not much work except like 3 or 4 assignments but overall pretty easy and interesting",1
"talks all lecture long about stuff that wont be on the exam, singles out students, control freak, loves the power of being a professor, terrible teacher, boring lectures, makes her students feel extremely uncomfortable, worst professor i have ever had in my five years",0
"She's an awesome professor. The class is an easy A in my opinion as long as you do the work required. Theres about 12 labs, but you only have to do 8. There are 10 discussion boards, but you only have to do 8. 4 easy quizzes, but you have to do 3. 2 tests, but you can bring a note card. If you do the extra labs then you get extra credit. Easy A.",1
grogan makes me dread going to class. she's condescending and her class is the same every day.,1
"Professor Deason is awesome! I always learn something in her lectures, and she is very knowledgeable about social psychology. Tests are easy if you do the study guide she provides and look back on her powerpoints. There are small assignments to keep you on track; not too difficult. Overall, take her. You won't regret it.",1
"Worst proffessor EVER. All she talks about Is her family and how she lived in Spain, without understanding that no one cares. Always makes you participate and if you pronounce something wrong while speaking out she makes you look dumb. Gives a lot of hard test, you must complete the online homework, and you can only miss 2 classes. DONT DO IT",0
"Classic great Prof, take all of his classes. Lecture oriented, you get out what you put in. This means you will learn a lot, or you will get an easyish A.",1
"She teaches the material extremely well, and is really diligent in helping students out with assignments. Everything you need to do well in this class is contained in her lectures along with some practice problems from Dr. Ryba's website. Definitely take a class with her if you can- she's great!",1
"I started this class four weeks late. My first class was two days before the midterm in October, and I still succeeded formidably. Tao is absolutely amazing. She took me aside and gave me private one-on-one to have me catch up, and she was gracious about SASS accommodations. She is hilarious, her lectures are always fun. I'd recommend this class.",1
Dr. Kramer is a good instructor. He's very knowledgeable and makes the info more relatable to students so it isn't just textbook definitions. You'll need to read the text for exams but it's actually decent and easy to understand. We have quite a few exams (6?) but they're only on a few chapters and are very short. Make sure you have the BAII Plus!,1
"Great prof. â took this and ECON 302 with him (A in that too). I actually understand whatâs going on in the market now thanks to him. If I could, Iâd take all my econ with him. Straightforward class, long essay tests but heâs a forgiving grader. He loves his subject and it shows â wish there were 10x the number of professors like him.",1
He really knows his field.  He is tough but fair.,1
"Easily the worst professor I've had during my entire college career (I'm a senior). Avoid at all costs. Random grading procedures, boring lectures, and useless textbooks. A giant waste of 15 weeks and three credits.",0
"She is the worst teacher I have ever had in my entire life. She is rude, very unorganized and I learned limited to nothing from her, I mostly taught myself. She neglects to speak in English so no one ever knows what's going on and if I had to take her again I would rather just miss that credit and suffer the consequences later. Don't take her class",0
She is the most AWESOME TEACHER EVER! If you can take cog. phsycology with her DO!!!,1
"Dr. Spiegel is a really nice person, but I truly did not enjoy this course. Mentally prepare yourself for the pre-quizzes - they aren't difficult (graded for completion), but they take probably 4 hours each (usually one per week). Just took his final btw, start praying now.",0
His 2001 class sounds like this : Proof proof proof Proof proof proof Proof proof proof... Thats dumb that he also teaches during tutorial!!,0
"Probably the worst teacher I've ever had, along with the worst course notes I've ever had.
 
 Result: Worst course I've ever taken
 
 Keep far far away from this teacher, as he can't teach and takes pleasure in demeaning and power-tripping off the limited authority he has over his student's fate.",0
"The professor is one of the greatest in the CS department, the course is really tough and hard, especially the 800 level is really insane, I would suggest graduates take the 400 level course and they will be fine.",1
"This class is honestly dumb. I have learned nothing and Dr. Gaitros just repeats what's in the book or tells uninteresting unrelated stories. Also, if you're not in the very front row you can't hear him at all. He tells you what's on the tests but your answer has to be correct word for word. Essay heavy class",0
"I LOVE JASON PREY!!! AMAZING teacher. very hands on and very passionate about what he does. He will help you if you need it. It isn't an easy class though, you have to put in the work. If you're going to take A&P it is a MUST to take it with this professor! He makes the lectures so entertaining.. you can't wait to come to class every day!",1
The information she provides in the lectures is rarely if ever useful. She is not helpful if you ask for advice regarding studying. The tests are incredibly difficult and specific. They cover everything from the book and the lecture. Also the powerpoints are not uploaded to webcourses so take notes and pictures!,0
"She's a very nice person, not my style teacher. Would not take another class with her. She gives arbitrarily gives 50% on homeworks with no feedback, gives no partial credit on exams and you will not get the participation points for just showing up. When we did well on an exam, she told the class she'd make the next one harder.",0
"She is the absolute best! I taken her history class as my first online class and I did not regret a single bit of it. Not a lot of assignments and she gives you so much time to complete them, you would be crazy not to take this class. I would be taking another class with her next semester.",1
It never ceases to amaze me that someone that useless has now promoted herself to the position of poster crone for the planning masthead on the website - I can only speculate what she did to get that!,0
"It's a very detailed subject with a lot of information covered in a relatively short time. Show up (most important!), read the text, do your homework and it's easy-peasy. Make sure to take notes because he gives a lot of extra explanation in class to help understand the text/labs.",1
"Dr. Handley is a the most unreasonable professor I've ever had. Grades way too harshly and yells at students like a high school teacher would. Very disorganized and won't return lab grades back so you are left wondering how to improve. A pretty impossible class for a GenEd, wouldn't recommend taking Handley at all. Avoid at all costs, actually.",0
"Dr. Raymer is my favorite instructor that I've had in the CS program. He's incredibly helpful, down to earth, and genuinely cares about student success. Explains material in a way that makes it easy to understand, and checks often to make sure students are grasping the material. I'll definitely be taking another course with him.",1
Probably the worst teacher I have ever had.  He is incredibly boring (he only uses powerpoint) during class and the readings he picks are painful.  He is also a very unfair grader and grades based on favoritism.  He also assigns an insane amount of work for an intro class.  He is also very unclear and unwilling to help students.,0
Professor Haberman is a great teacher! He truly cares about his students. I took his class online and felt that it was really difficult. He invited me to his office hours and he spent an incredible amount of time with me making sure I understood the content. Such an amazing professor and a really good person.,1
Take Dr Lane! He doesn't believe in giving exams and his lectures are so much fun. He usually just puts you in groups and has you play games or give small presentations. Made the class so much better than expected.,1
"Unprepared before lectures. He started drawing a circuit on the board once and after 10 minutes of scribbling he gave up and said ""shoulda made it into a slide"". Kinda sums up his teaching style. I duked it out with him once in class because of how incomprehensible he was. I regret not having complained about him. worst prof. worst grade I ever got",0
"A Teacher that focuses on giving many assignments online over teaching inclass. Class requires calculus and says it does not require calculus even though the original class description does not mention calculus as a prereq. To its credit, it says it requires critical thinking, problem solving, but the tests are harder because of its requirements.",0
"His lecturing isn't the worst, but he makes you fill in blanks and you have to add textboxes when you could be paying attention to his lecture. He tests on very specific and arbitrary details and the marking scheme is unnecessarily rigid (good luck reading his mind when there's five missing words in a row for fill in the blanks).",0
"My favorite teacher at CCNY thus far. She gives great feedback and it's obvious that she wants the best for all her students. She's accessible outside of class, and depending on how much your class participates, she gives extra credit. Attending lecture is mandatory! Pop quizzes! But she's great and understanding as long as you communicate.",1
"Gives 5 'quizzes'. Legitimately 95- 114 questions that are multiple choice, t/f, and short answer. Questions ask very specific facts in class and they require you to know the statistics. You have to memorize everything he has ever said/shown or you won't pass. The Final is even longer! He doesn't try to engage the class at all, not even discussions",0
"Dr. Schneider was probably the best accounting professor I've had thus far at ECU. His lectures and notes are very organized (don't need to buy the book) and he teaches the material extremely well. You still have to study but he always tests you on things you should have studied, no tricks. He is a funny guy but in the dry and nonchalant way. Take.",1
She does not allow you to use your phone. If you do then you will loose participation points whether you participate or not. If what you say is different from what she believes then you are screwed. She will lecture you and ask why you think what you think and then she will tell what she thinks and why she is right.,0
"Really nice, takes everyones picture and gets to know you! Was good for first half of course, but afterwards it was evident that she didn't know too much on the topic herself... don't take any courses involving C++ w/ her, she doesn't know it!!",1
"Avoid. Does not tell you when ""enhancements"" are due. Trying to follow lecture is impossible and he will call on you and then cut you off. Just avoid.",0
"I would recommend, anyone taking accounting to take his class. I had never done accounting before and this was my first class related to accounting. He gives a  lot of homework for each chapter he does. If you wanna succeed in his class attend all his classes and do the homework and you are set. Great teacher. Explains material really well. Helpful",1
"This man is the worst professor I have ever encountered. Disorganized, wild tangents about Nazis and Eugenics, and ""jokes"" that would probably get a student a one-on-one meeting with the dean. Stay as far away from this guy as you can. Tests and finals used to be easy, but he had instructions from admin to change them, now they're super difficult.",0
Neely is monotone and his class is done through video lecture. That is a terrible combination. A 100-500 word response on what you learned that week is due every week and he is not clear on what should be included AT ALL! Don't bother emailing him because he will be defensive and rude if you do not understand the requirements. Don't waste your time,0
"She assigns way too much work. Her discussion boards and current events are fine, but her worksheets are awful. Even with the textbook it's hard to find the right answers because she changes the wording and makes the questions confusing. I will be getting an A in this class, but it was not easy. I wouldn't recommend this prof if you want an easy A.",0
"Maybe it's because I had his class in the morning, but wasn't stimulated by his course. I found him to lack any sense of humor, and while he is very knowledgeable, my passion for production feels dulled.",1
Lectures are boring,0
"Wendy's lectures were hard to follow, unclear, and did not accurately represent the material tested in the midterm- which had a shockingly bad average even after scaling. Her assignments are long, difficult, and graded on a pass/fail basis. The mandatory sign-in attendance took up at least 10 minutes of each 50 minute class. I do not recommend.",0
Show up and the class isn't hard. He tells you exactly what's on the exams and explains concepts well. He has good notes on overhead sheets so be prepared to write a lot down.,1
"She is all over the place, she tries to assign us homework that we've already done. I don't blame her though, all the busy work she gives us is the same. She gave me a 0 on accident and I asked her every class period for two weeks to change the grade on moodle and she still hasn't. Get it together girl.",0
Prof Justice does everything a professor should do for his students. He explains how to do problems and gives exercises to do on (do them and ask questions on the discussion board) Utilize him and his knowledge because he will respond and explain in depth how to do things. His office hours are also very helpful but come with questions. 10/10 prof!!,1
"Even though much of the class was failing, she would say that this was baby bio in comparison to the Biology course she took in college. This was demoralizing and humiliating. She also would discourage nursing students who have children, which I thought was odd because Goodwin is a career-focused college with a lot of students who have families.",0
He's a very difficult professor.  I didn't feel he was really teaching us because I had a very hard time doing my homework because I didn't understand.,0
Exams were completely off the wall hard. Grading was tough. Lectures tolerable.,0
Absolutely do not take this man's class. He relies on the online textbook and you to teach yourself. He didn't interact with the class at all for it being a Social Psych class. This class was horrible and the professor was ineffective.,0
This professor is incredibly full of himself and spends the entire class spewing his own ideas and philosophies and does not allow full discussion or debate amongst his students. He is rude and condescending towards the students in his class and is unclear on expectations on assignments. His class is poorly structured and it is difficult to learn,0
"Don't waste your time. 40sec/mc. Since schooling is online, every 15 seconds she brings up her ms and how it is related to the course material. Shares a story about herself then talks about course material for another 15 seconds. Back to her stories. Don't waste your time. Most disrespectful prof I have ever had. Treats students like trash.",0
Great professor. Best I have ever had. Wish I could take more classes. ,1
"If you are in the psychology field, it is a must to learn about your professors as you expect them to learn about you. You must read and learn the flow of this class and if you are involved and listen to her lectures, she pretty much tells you what will be on every graded quiz or test. Reach out and you will be met at the other end. Effort is key",1
He likes to hear himself talk. But he doesn't like to hear himself talk in the vernacular. I spent half of my time trying to figure out what he was even talking about.  He overcomplicates things.  And don't waste your time emailing him for help. He won't reply.,0
"Here's the deal. If you enjoy astronomy, this class is great. Its a lot of stuff you've learned in HS and before. In my case, I always went to class but did other work. He givea you all the questions word for word on the test in the guides. Google questions, get answers, memorize and get A.  5 mandatory, random attendance. Drops lowest test. ",1
Very funny and you can tell she loves what she is doing. Passionate about her job. As long as you read and show up you should do well.,1
"This was my favorite class this semester. Research and writing about new media and social media. Time in class is never too demanding, but I always felt like what he talked about was useful. And his comments on essays are really helpful. (also, I got a 95% on one of our essays, so I don't know what the comment below me is talking about!)",1
"Easy A. He is very strict about taking attendance everyday, and will mark you down if you miss too much. However, all of the exams including the final are online, and there is no homework. Show up and you'll do fine. His lectures are also very interesting and he helps keep you awake, because it is an early class! Great guy.",1
He knows how to set up a class perfectly and gives homework at a very appropriate time. His lectures are very direct and he does not waste time. He communicates the subject extremely well,1
"Don't expect this class to help your GPA. He goes off on tangents during teaching lectures, great guy, but not a great teacher. Homework is very time consuming and the tests are challenging but graded on a curve. Don't be fooled, the curve only helps a little. But he's willing to help you. Don't take this class if you're trying to better your GPA. ",1
Not very nice to all students. Will disregard what your saying if she doesn't think it's important to finish what you're saying. Rushes through lectures with information overload. Doesn't allow laptops in discussion classes. Not flexible or lenient.,0
"This isn't my hardest class but I'm failing it. I suck at math and I know it, yet I can do molar conversions in chemistry and have a difficult time understanding stats. She sucks at this. Don't take her unless you like teaching yourself. Never gives any study guides for exams and there's a quiz every week. DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS YOU WILL FAIL!!!!!!!",0
He explains how to do business algebra clearly and gives practice tests online if you do them youll be fine,1
This is the absolute worst class and professor I have ever taken. She is an unreasonably hard and inconsistent grader. Gives contradictory feedback and is rude and belittling in doing so. Her grading system is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen. I should have dropped this class. STAY AWAY!!!,0
Dr. Trent was helpful. She provided study guides for exams. She also was good with sending email reminders about important due dates.,1
I would understand if the course was the regular length. But if you are going to make it mandatory to basically force feed myself the material in a small amount of time. SOMETHING would be nice,0
"Really good teacher, I enjoyed my time in class. He makes it interesting and you actually learn material by attending class. He's very helpful and fair in his evaluations! Definitely recommending him.",1
"To be fair, Partovi is very knowledgable and many people really do like him. However, you should expect 100 pages of reading a week, an amount of rudeness, and a final that will consist of writing a 12-15 page historiographical review of the scholarship relating to the topic being taught. Keep in mind that this is a lower-division undergrad class.",0
"knows what she is doing, but cannot understand what she says.  Too much homework and she thik that everyone in her class is a math master.",0
"Evil! Evil! Evil! She makes me hate spanish, we have no other alternative to her, which makes things even worse! She's mean and never really gives you an awnser. She expects people to understand the first time, and never has any patience.",0
"If you want an easy A take him, if you want to learn then don't. He is often confused and unsure of what to do so as a student you must take the initiative, although this is not a concern for your grade. Just relax and enjoy any easy class. He is actually quite funny and nice.",1
Terrible professor. She is very rude. Does not use D2L and is very unclear about what she wants.,0
"He is one of my favorite teachers. Prepare to laugh while learning because he is a very funny teacher. He's very helpful, but makes you correct your own mistakes.",1
This course was quite difficult and the material is not simplified for those who aren't strong in math. He reads off the slides in the lectures so it's still hard to understand the concepts. Put in the work for the quizzes and excel assignments to help boost your grade during the semester.,0
"He's a decent teacher but if you're work is not in exactly on time he will hate you the rest of the semester. He's not at all flexible or understanding, and on top of that he's extremely boring. If you want an intersting class, or if you are a procrastinator, do not take Blake!",0
"A great prof! Really recommend him if you want to learn OOP, he will always help uf you need, but you should study this subject.",1
"This professor wasn't terrible, per se, but unfortunately no one really learns anything from him. A regular class consists of him writing test questions on the board in sloppy handwriting and speaking quietly. You have to ask him to explain concepts, so it didn't feel like he taught us anything except what the answers to the test are.",0
I took the AP Scholars Intro to Bio class with her.  It was an odd class because there was pretty much no lectures.  There were a lot of modelling activities (along with the worksheets for them).  She did not communicate very well what she expected of us grading wise and communication with the LA's was poor as well.,0
"Deb Fels utilized a series of guest lectures in lieu of presenting course materials. The guest lectures represented related content; it did not explain the concepts of the course text book. The final exam was 100% from the textbook. I know I did not Fel the exam, but I did not do as well as I could have with lectures on course material.",0
"Took this Summer 2020 online due to COVID (keep in mind) and professor was absent most of the course. Instructed us to complete group projects & discussions on every chapter of the textbook, thus teaching ourselves the course. This and pre-set reading quizzes on Connect with the text was all we did. Feedback & updates were next to nonexistent.",0
Its a really tough class,1
"A fun, enthusiastic lecturer.  Really made this course enjoyable.",1
"Absolutely the worst professor i've ever had. Calc is already a tough subject, then you add a professor who doesn't teach anything except theories & basically you're out of luck.",0
"Mr. P was AWESOME! This was my first time taking an online class, and I thought it was going to be a nightmare. Piluso is a really cool and down-to-earth professor who is willing to work with his students to ensure their success. The assignments are easy yet thought-provoking. His only goal is to help you think and expand your reasoning and views.",1
"He is a very dry Prof. The class is very lecture heavy, and if you dont show up, there is no way you will know whats on the test. The readings dont matter at all, except for the 2 assigned books. The real textbook is more for personal reference if you do not understand the basics. So you have to go to class, and try to stay awake, its a challenge.",0
"He goes far beyond his job description for his students. He helped me with deciding my next college, and even wrote a recommendation for me. If you show up to class and listen to what he has to say you will get a good grade. He grades on participation in labs instead of passing out tons of homework. Best professor at ILCC. He gives free food too!",1
"Very good lecturer who keeps things moving along. Very interesting.  Quizzes tend to be difficult as you take them, but the material seems much easier a week or so after the fact, so focus on studying/hw to stay ahead of the curve. Final was quite difficult, but study hard and there should be a nice curve to help you out.  Definetly reccomend.",1
"She is really nice and really cares. Her lectures were pretty good, but there weren't many of them. I hate public speaking so this class was really hard from me, but there was also a ton of homework. The homework was a lot of work and seemed unnecessary.",1
"She is a good prof, but a tough marker.  She likes people to participate in discussion in class and is not happy when people have not read the material before class.  She can be a bit quirky, but interesting.",1
Ed just loves those early morning office hours so he's kinda hard to talk to 1 on 1. H/O the class isn't that hard - the paper topics are interesting and he works hard to use film clips and anecdotes to break up the monotony that he knows exists. Very friendly and easy to talk to! Feedback on papers is excellent!,1
He is so funny and is so good at explaining. his lectures help so much and he will help during office hours.,1
"The class is only as tough as you make it.  Try not to procrastinate if you can help it.  She tries to make it so you add to the final paper throughout the semester.  She's adamant about not taking late work but I went above and beyond, going for 112 pages on the 90-page paper, so she is understanding.  Nice woman overall, even if blunt.",1
"please don't get me wrong hes a smart individual, but a good teacher hes not. He bring a negative and depressing energy in to the class room. what do i mean by that, well you'll be leaving class felling negative about yourself. he doesn't like do be specific when ask a question. to make this short. DON'T TAKE HIM FOR A CLASS.",1
She is so rude and inconsiderate. She goes out of her way to make you feel inadequate. I don't think I want to see her face ever again.,0
"I liked this prof...the java class was very entertaining. He taught in a casual way, which was easy to understand. Superb help in labs, this guy will teach you how to code if you're willing to listen. However if you never coded java/anything else in your life this class might have a bit of a steep learning curve.",1
"So this professor isn't great by any means. Yes, he is kind but only in person. I take online classes because I work a lot and I had to go see him if I had a question because he is ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE at responding to email. I never received an email. He also didn't start grading until the quarter was practically over. He contradicts himself.",0
"She was very interesting, open minded and fair with her marking. As for the repeating, I would rather a teacher repeat interesting information in a nice manner then one that could care less what my name is or what I thought. She was by far one of the best teachers I have had at uvic.",1
Exudes sheer awesomeness,1
"There's a lot of work to do in this class, but you'll be fine if you keep up with the work and the deadlines. The guy talks a lot but overall, chill professor.",1
"I hope that someone reports this guy, he shouldn't be aloud to teach with the way he talk to his students.",0
She is a great professor! Would definitely take her class again.,1
"On top of her strong accent she talks extremely soft so you can understand anything she says. Her tests are easy, but  she makes you study also every piece of work in the chapters, expect to memorize at least a hundred slides before the midterm and final. Try to avoid taking this teacher at all costs",0
"I took elementary span 1 online w. her & it was tragic. Homework was due every week (over 70 assignments, not exaggerating) The class description said it was for people with little to no knowledge of Spanish (me) but the work was for Span 2 speakers. WHATEVER YOU DO STAY AWAY SHE WAS NOT UNDERSTANDING AT ALL. I WISH THERE WERE MORE CHARACTERS ...",0
"Worst prof I've ever had at Guelph. Lectures are excruciatingly slow/boring. Never given an interesting lecture, rambles incoherently. Assignment descriptions are vague, frequently changes them, has to add pages full of Q&A from confused students. Totally overwhelmed by this course and the number of assessments for very little %. Haven't learned",0
"Overcomplicates all of the topics, going to class hurts more than it helps. He burns through the material, and the review sessions and practice midterms had nothing to do with the actual test. Gives lots of notes and examples in class, but uses totally different ones on the homework. Would not recommend",0
"Get ready to have to do at least 50 pages of reading (textbook and articles), watch 30-45 mins of videos AND read about 20-30 powerpoint slides PER WEEK. The quizzes are open book, but the questions are so specific that, no matter how much you prepare/study, you will still have no idea what's going on. Also, lots of trick questions.",0
"Came into this class thinking if one did the work, read the textbook, came to class and took notes on his powerpoints, one would be fine. WRONG. very unclear prof, tests, midterms, essays and assignment instructions are too vauge and takes marks off w.o justification. RUDE and never replies emails, dosent even mark the work. UNQUALIFIED",0
"Unorganized, but a real character.  The class is always engaging because he has such a charismatic personality.  Plus his classes are always easy.  Take a class with him, you'll have fun.",1
1000% recommend this teacher to anybody. I was so nervous to take Bio online but she made it so easy. Yes it takes time to watch her lectures but thats with any bio class. Every week you have a 10 question lab quiz and around every 4 weeks is an exam. Stay on the work and you have no problem passing this class. She is amazing and incredible.,1
He's my favorite professor.  His lectures are amazing.  He should do those Teaching Company tapes.  H is hilarious.  You really learn in his classes.,1
"She grades tough, but gives you clear instructions and great feedback. Very helpful!!!",1
"Absolutely loved this professor! Even though I took her English 101 class online, she emailed once a week to remind us about due dates (online teachers generally expect you to know your due dates and don't do reminders). She was super friendly and helpful when I needed to reach her via email. Her assignments aren't hard but they are time consuming.",1
"She wants everyone to do well, but you have to so your share.  There is a lot of dry reading that you have to do to get a good grade.  Pop-quizzes make attendance important but class goes by fast and she is really nice.",1
"I'm willing to give her the benefit of the doubt and guess that her summertime switch to Canvas screwed things up, but it doesn't account for all of the negligence. As an online teacher, it is paramount to be responsive to emails. She has been thoroughly unresponsive and inaccessible. +tomorrow is the final day, and she's graded one assignment.",0
Professor Rosso was one of the best professors I've had at Southern. My class shifted to remote learning in the middle of the semester and he was so helpful with making sure everyone still understood the content. He is so passionate about what he teaches and really wants to see his students succeed.,1
"Dr. Bayers is an outstanding professor.  Class was great, even the books were awesome to read.",1
"Not a great professor. She was a nice person, however inconsistently especially when it came to grading. SHE HAD NO RUBRICS, takes points off for no reason. I took this class for an easy A, but it wasn't the case especially with unclear how she grades. Graded only on papers and open note quizzes. Read 109 poems total most of them short and quick.",0
I took Dr. Makover's Calc I class a long time ago. Years have passed and I still see reviews that mirror the horror of my Calculus class. Avoid him at all costs. I dropped his class and retook it with another professor... took that professor for most of my other math courses.. Got A's in all of them.,0
Debbie was the course coordinator but we had a guy (Bob?) as our lecturer. The course now is called CSE 1211 I think. Debbie was fair and listened to us complain about the lecturer - he was just plain awful. She gave as many tips as possible but this is definitely a more self-motivated class. DO THE LABS AND HOMEWORK EARLY! This class is worth it!,1
"Great prof!  Even though he seems a little crazy, he prepared me so well for grad school!",1
"His the best, he has made my college experienced worth it. his like the cherry to my ice cream, he definitely worth taking. U should def take him for RWS 305 his classes get full fast, many people want to crash it. I hated every other teacher last semseter and  i have waitited all my life just to take this teacher. His the best prof ever loves him",1
"He knows the material but he hates teaching this course, so it gets super boring. He posts all the powerpoint material on canvas, although he gives pop quizzes that DO effect your grade. He usually does one the class before break too. He is an awesome person, this class just sucks. Exams are hard, take notes and read the textbook.",1
"You are graded on four things; Two papers (both of which are difficult) and two exams, where if you do not know the material inside and out you will fail. If I wanted to take a philosophy class I would have, but for a criminal justice course, this guy is all over the place and lectures are lengthy and confusing.",0
"She's never specific with what she wants in her papers, and expects them done quickly. She doesn't explain the information well and the book she uses is no help at all. Her lesson plan is extremely unorganized and you can tell she planed it right before class. She grades based on favorites though so be nice to her and you'll get a good grade.",0
best mech eng prof.....take ME 459,1
I would not take any class that she teaches because it could hurt your GPA. I found it difficult to reach her outside of class. She will not see you in her office unless you have an appointment. The one time I walked into her office she was doing a crossword puzzle and told me she couldn't see me because I did not have an appointment.,0
"Terrible class, so hard to follow.",0
So good to see there are professors that living and teaching as though they too live in the real world! ;),1
"As much as I'd love to find the good in professor Vitz at UCSD, I simply cannot. He does not ""lecture"" he simply reads out of the articles and adds unnecessary pauses in his voice to make it sound educating. Papers require lecture citations but all uploaded power points are useless (they are just pictures & words with no context). Avoid taking him.",0
Never take her if you want to save your time and money,0
"Doc is a teacher whom students either love or absolutely hate. If you havent had a background in chemistry, this class will be even harder. He primarily lectures about the history and theory of chemistry. He does post previous year tests, but they are fairly little help for the tests. Studying with groups is the best thing that would help.",0
"Currently in this class and regret taking it. If you miss a day you have to write an ""apology letter;"" he gets really butt hurt. Doesn't use blackboard. When he ""teaches"" its just him going off on a tangent about a random subject not related to mythology. I am usually good in class but not this one. Do yourself a favor and take someone else.",0
"She is the perfect professor for GESM, one of the easiest GESMs that allow you to actually learn something and get an A. Go to every vision & voice she ask and do the little homework she assigned then you will get an A. She cares about every student and put all her efforts on every class. Available in Spring (probably Autumn) semester.",1
"He is very unclear with assignments and homework and not always organized, the homework rarely went along with the class. He is VERY picky with grading and expects your essays to be perfect. He knows the language extremely well but gets easily distracted and its hard to learn much in this class",0
"On the newsgroup, one student said ""The assignment never said we weren't allowed to print extra stuff"" because marks were deducted for extra output. Peter responded ""The assignment never said you could print extra stuff!"" It's perfectly normal to print extra helpful feedback as the program runs. Talk about helpfulness and professional behavior!",0
"This class is SO hard. I'm usually a great student but this class with SHRED YOU APART. If you don't read your notes every night and plant to study EVERY NIGHT then you will not do good, class average on a test we had was 60%. Please read this as a caution.",0
"This class is SO much reading, about 150 pages a week (books, not textbook). Wheeler is knowledgable and interesting but the class is so fast paced that I found it hard to participate. If you're really interested in history/social movements and can handle a ton of reading, take it. Personally I didn't like the class bc of the workload",1
"Dr. Mori is WONDERFUL! She is very knowledgeable about music theory, and I laugh every day in that class! She is a great teacher, and I don't know why people say that they can't understand her. Yes, she does have a thick accent, but I have NEVER (not even once) had trouble understanding what she's saying. Remember, ""NO AUGMENTED SECONDS!!!""",1
he is so arrogant and thinks he knows everything.... take someone else if you can,0
"Unbelievable professor. She is the root of what it means to be a good teacher and she works every day to show that. She always shows up with a smile on her face and she's enthusiastic about everything. She uses great examples and replies to e-mails very fast. All in all, my favorite professor at UMD. ",1
"He is a good teacher, he will help you when you ask him. He dresses well and has a swell personality, I would recommend him to other students.",1
"This professor doesn't provide any constructive feedback or rationalization for grades.  Course was: read text, answer questions at end of text, submit a paper based on another question.  Tests are taken from obscure portions of text with no study guide available.  Contact via email was not helpful as he provided no usable feedback.  Unimpressed.",0
"I took this fall 2015 as a required FED course for chemical engineering. It was AWFUL. Its 3 hours of pure torture. Monotone, gives no direction, and cant control his class. Its a water-air pipe system, AKA a boring project. Do your work first, then goof off. Oh, and the entire course is a group project (no, you dont pick your group). Good luck -_-",0
Stallar was opposed to anyone who challenged or questioned him. He is very biased and discriminatory.,0
This is the easiest class I have taken at IU yet. She is a definite GPA booster ,1
"Statistics...yuck!  But Dr. R. rocked.  He wrote the book, so he is an expert.  And he always made time to meet with me and other students.  Definitely the best professor at Wheeling Jesuit.",1
Just stay away. You won't get grade you want.,0
"very amazing professor. she expects a lot out of her students. if you pay attention in class , take notes, and go home and study a bit then you will be solid. take her instead of the other orgo proffs that don't help or genuinely care.",1
"this teacher makes tcu look terrible. I had a serious medical emergency on the day of the test and she torpedoed my grade. she is offensive and flat wrong when discussing certain topics. Takes a very stereotypical view on the world, and will not consider oposing views at all. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. PERIOD. YOU WILL SUFFER IF YOU DO. I PROMISE.",0
"He's very sweet and helpful once you get to know him personally. Needs to work on his level of engagement with students, however. His lectures were often scattered, although intelligent. Wish he could have explained it in a more organized, coherent manner. I loved him, though! Insightful and open-minded person. I'd marry him if I could",1
Dr. Jones is an amazing person. I think that she would be a great person to collaborate with if you're interested in community service. As a professor.. not so much. I personally did not like how this class flowed. I loved the main goals and the purpose for this course but I hated the unnecessary assignments. Only got harder when we moved online.,1
The professor teaches outdated material and is rather rude at times. I wouldn't recommend taking this class if you can avoid it.,0
It's hard not to be enthused about biology when you take Ken's class. He exudes a love of the subject. And is always there for you. ,1
"Debra Stevens is the worst teacher I've ever had. I cannot imagine why ANYONE would give her any rating other than 1. Her class is incredibly poorly organized, her writing is riddled with errors, and she is almost impossible to get ahold of. Also, she uses a textbook to teach English? What? Just a bad teacher.",0
"Extremely arrogant, expects far too much of students. his sarcasm levels very often reach offensive levels, comparing poor programmers in the class to the engineers of the space shuttle Columbia. Seems to think that students aren't taking other courses.",0
"His assignment load is heavy due to 1 per week, but he actually takes the time to do similar examples in class lecture to help us out. The midterm and exams are pretty straight foward.. if you did your studying.",1
"Devon is so knowledgeable and brings that knowledge and enthusiasm to class every day. If you've never had interest in poetry, take this course. If you love poetry, take this course. Bottom line, TAKE THIS COURSE. You won't regret it. She respects students' busy schedules, just make sure you finish your work by the time the portfolio is due. ",1
He knows something about his narrow area of interest but is an arrogant jerk. He loves to drop names of people at big schools who swoon over his genius. One wonders why he's not at Northwestern! Massage his ego; get a good grade. Don't expect much coverage in his classes. He turns questions about something he doesn't know into something he does.,0
"This is my second semester with this professor - great as always. This was his first semester teaching this particular course (E-Tailing and Retailing), and his lectures were built to reflect the most up-to-date topics.    My advice: participate in discussions (you'll get more from the course), re-read articles for the test, and pick a good group!",1
I took Professor Walker for Public Speaking during the summer and it was the best class ever! He cares about his students and gives great feedback. He grades on self improvement. If you show up everyday and do all the speeches you will pass (most likely with an A). Loved that class!,1
"Dr. Vazquez has the right approach to being a physics lab instructor. Definitely a solid choice. Show up to class and do the work, and you'll get a good grade.",1
Super great guy whos passionate about the material and wants to see younger people learn. Only problem I had was that his exams were a pretty hard but if you set aside a few hours for each one you should be fine. Definitely take him if you have the chance!,1
"Dr. Lyons is a really nice prof, and I think she wants students to do well, but doesn't adapt to different learning types. Her tests are way too hard.",0
Shes a great teacher,1
"Matchett wasnt an awful prof, but he wasnt good. Chemistry has always come somewhat easy for me, but the way he taught it in lecture was confusing and made it difficult. He also has a temper and had yelled at my class numerous times through the semester and can be rude over email. If you can, I would switch profs if you get him.",1
Toughest part of class was that it was 8:00 AM class.  He gave you plenty of help if you needed it because of sleeping through too many classes or such and was always very clear when he explained something.,1
I didn't believe the rumors I'd heard. I should have. Flee this class. You're still reading. Flee I said!,0
"This man is painfully awful. He is super sarcastic and when asked a questions he will revert it and at as if it is a comedy club. Even though no one will laugh he still sticks to his act. Not very good at teaching at all, flies through content and the whole class gets low scores on quizzes. Awful professor, would not recommend.",0
Terrible exams 28 min to complete a 35 question exam and the material doesn't match the content taught. When asked to adjust this he flat out told the class this is how he teaches,0
"Pretty good teacher, but she teaches straight out of the textbook. Honestly if you just read enough you'll be fine. Her lectures kind of suck, and she gets annoyed when people don't participate, but as long as you read the material the tests are a breeze.",1
"Horrible professor. He is super boring and is extremely monotone and quiet. Nobody pays any attention to him. Did I mention he was boring? You are not going to learn anything in this class. Attendance is mandatory. I've seen him chase down students who left early so he can take away points from them. Horrible dreadlocks, they smell really bad",0
"Absolutely love this class. Do not underestimate the work for it, though, there's a lot. Incredible professor",1
"Its hard to believe this is a math class because it seems like all your marks come from grammar. Not correct grammar, but punctuated grammar. And you're good at memorizing his exact sentences if you want marks!",0
"He is a great guy but he doesn't give very good instructions. He is very experienced, but I think age is beginning to affect his memory and processing.",0
"I'm sure this professor is great is you're a math genius and have a background in calculus but for someone that is just taking the class because it is required, she is horrible. She refused to let us submit an exam after her bedtime, even after many students explained that we WORK. She's not understanding and refused to do more than 1 exam review.",0
"What can I say about him? he is a nice person but McGill please replace him with somebody that knows what he/she is talking about,extremely unorganized lectures,assignments and exams, easy grader , he literally gave away 60 points out of 100 point so everybody passes with a good grade but I'm sure nobody learn a thing.",0
"the absolute hardest nursing class i have taken at bellarmine. so much busy work. every class we either had a quiz or paper due while also taking two other nursing classes that all require tons of studying. the powerpoints are not helpful and the exams are hard, not what you would expect to be tested over. helps out of class, but classclear as mud",1
"Very mean, didn't let me sleep in morning class. But overall, she's good at coding",0
"""Computers can store data... but they cannot store happiness"" - S Song",1
"Great professor, no doubt. One of the best ones in the CJ Field.",1
"Tyler is a very knowledgeable professor. I think he is an efficient professor... he gets things done on time, but is he an effective professor? not really. His grading criteria is clear but his time-consuming requirements like homework and online exercises do not have a lot of weight on your grade. The 4 exams are your best bet so study study study",0
The final was 5 QUESTIONS and 30 PERCENT of the class grade!! This is a good representation of how awful the CS department is at UWEC.,0
"She is very clear when explaining questions in class, and cares if students are actually learning. She is helpful and when there is clearly a problem fixes it fairly for students. She also is refreshing and easy to pay attention to. Classes are important to attend :)",1
hard,0
"Dr. Bohanans class is lecture heavy. She doesnt allow phones out, but her lectures are far from boring. Attendance is taken through an assigned seating chart and if you show up consistently, shell bump your grade at the end of the semester. She has a few reading questions on each exam, but you could definitely get an A without reading at all.",1
"HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE and MISERABLE WOMEN!!!...PURE EVIL!!!",0
No,1
Doesn't know how to park at Tim Horton's TOTAL FAUX-PAS!!!,0
Tests are just like the homeworks this is usually the case for lazy professors. However he cares a lot about his students. Gives excellent lectures.,1
I wish i knew about this website before taking his class. I recommend not taking this class unless you're looking for failure.,0
"This class is the worse I have taken during my time at this college. He will grade based on opinion, if he doesnt agree with your opinion on discussions he will fail you. I have straight As on the rest of my courses but this class I have an F and I have spent sleepless nights writing the essays for him to say he doesnt like my opinion on subject",0
"His lecture style is bad, he pauses in the middle of sentences so you aren't sure if he ended his thought or not. He always has a cough and would cough right into his hand. He would pace across the front of the room while lecturing which I found distracting. There were frequent quizzes which was annoying. Would absolutely not recommend this prof.",0
"He is the worst teacher I have ever had the displeasure of meeting in my college career, he does not care about his students. He thinks anyone and everyone is trying to become a scientist.... don't take him if you can!!!!!!!!!!!! he is really hard",0
"Worth the effort, great prof.",1
Dr. Lane can be extremely rude. He's not the worst but not the best. Assignments are easy but pointless. Take class with someone else if possibl.e,0
"Nice guy, bad professor. His lectures are incredibly confusing. And his exams are brutal. If you want a good grade, you have to put a ton of effort in outside of class and teach yourself from the book. Find a different professor. ",0
Class was very boring; all we did was go over the grammar concepts we already learned for homework the night before. Everything I learned was from reading the textbook. Lots of homework but it helps your grade. It was his first year here I'm sure he will get better! He is very clear about what to expect for the tests and the class is pretty easy.,1
"She's great if you can deal with a little craziness.  If you have to have everything ordered and predictable, avoid her classes.  Her passion for writing is inspiring and she really makes an effort to include everyone from first-year MA students to finishing PhD students.",1
"Dr. Oliver was amazing!!! I learned SO much in this class! A lot of readings, but if you read most of the readings off BookRags or SparkNotes you'll be fine (know whats going on and pay attention in class if you're going to do this tho). Theres a couple of papers. He's a decent grader. Two exams: midterm & final. Study in groups for these!",1
Mr. Goudge is probably one of the worst teachers I have ever had. He gets off topic too easily & won't start the actual lesson until 10-20 minutes after class which is a clear waste of everyone's time and money. He talks too much about sports & his family. He likes to show off his maps that he's made with sports & claims everything has geography.,0
"The worst prof ever. Do not even give her the time of day. the most unsympathetic person you will ever meet. Her expectations for exams are absurd and she gives you no guidance whatsoever for anything. If you're spending money for these courses, at least spend it on a half decent prof.",0
Dr. Usher is among the best in Speed school IE. Always pick him over other professors. He loves dad jokes and will make your class time enjoyable. His prior experience comes out in every class with a small story about how what you learning in class was useful to him on the job.,1
The other recent review is 100% correct. He doesn't acknowledge technical issues and is not clear about what material is on which quiz. The material is VERY disorganized and instructor isn't helpful at all. Either ignores emails/discussions or just responds that he thinks everything is self-explanatory. Many students post questions that are ignored,0
She sucks as an Advisor all she does is **** u over. If she does not like u she will surly tell u to your face. Never have her as a professor and especially as an advisor,0
"Can never contact him and if you do, good luck reading it. Never received any help when it came to emails and waited until a few days before my exam to receive a midterm grade.",0
"Doesn't grade papers unless you turn them in early. If turned in early, he gives extra credit. Same with assignments. Tests and papers are worth almost all your grades. Fine lectures, makes them interesting, but rambles at times or repeats himself over different days and doesn't cover all of the material because of this.",1
"Grading is extremely subjective, and counts points off for not including things that were never mentioned in the question. The class avg for multiple tests was around 75%, and he blamed the students for ""not studying enough"" when I spent 3 hours preparing for it. Also includes material on homework not covered in class. Would not recommend his class",0
"For me, this was a super easy class especially because I don't read. She did have a lot of reading and essays to go with it but she talks about each section of a book so in depth that you don't really have to read. She puts a lot of notes on your essay and I think it's helpful because it basically shows what shes looking for in an essay.",1
"Lots of small assignments and small tests - but it's an English course so it's expected. Easy course if you're looking to boost your grade. She's hilarious and makes grammar ""fun."" Sometimes includes class presentations - attendance counts for peer grading assignments.",1
Dr. Brinson unapologetically expresses her religious views and political views in class. I find it unnecessary and unprofessional. She trys to be funny and attempts to make class interesting. Her tests are close to impossible. The only other grades in the class other than tests are the discussions which are also impossible. DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS!!!,0
"Kobak is a very friendly, light-hearted guy who knows his stuff. Plenty of short films to make class enjoyable. 3 tests plus 10 possible pt. extra credit. Do the extra credit, you're almost guarenteed perfect credit. A ""B"" is definitely attainable if you put in some effort. I recommend him.",1
"He's a nice guy, but I'd advise you to stay as far away from this unorganized mess of a professor as humanly possible. ",0
This class was made infinitely more difficult because theis professor has the bad habit of mumbling under his breathe and using ums and ahs all the time. He marks extremely harshly and makes questions worth more than they should be just so he can drop your grades. Which will happen!,0
"Hands down best prof I've had at FSU. He makes class very fun and interesting which is pretty difficult over Zoom. He is exceptionally kind and respectful. However, your 2 speeches will be graded by your TA. I had Faith Delle and she was great. Besides the 2 speeches, there are also 2 exams. This class was not only a breeze, but actually enjoyable.",1
"Professor Frazel is easily the best Latin teacher I've had in all my years of taking Latin. He expects a good effort from his students but he is always read and willing to meet with them, as his door is always open. He is full of knowledge that he is eager to share with his students. He is a very insightful person with a great sense of humor.",1
I graduated 5 years ago and what I learned in JLT's classes are legitimately the only things I remember from uOttawa/put into practice on a regular basis in the work force. The fact that I'm coming back to write this now shows how much of an impact her classes had. In other words: 10/10 recommend.,1
I had daily panic attacks because of Professor Kane. He wants his essays written in a specific way that does not make any sense. If you do not follow how he wants you to write the essay you will not do well. Participation is also graded in this class and although I speak in every class and contribute to discussions I have a C in participation.,0
"I enrolled inside this online course expecting to learn lots of interesting conceptual materials relating lifespan development studies, unfortunately I got immediately dropped by instructor without any further due of providing assistance to resolve urgent matters and CRC counseling didn't even bother to help me out either hurting my reputation!",0
"Straightforward professor. Clearly tells you what you need to do in order to pass. Reading is very important in order to pass exams as his lectures are not ""discussion based"" unless someone asks a question. I recommend you do all of the PLENTY of extra credit offered. Attendance not required, BUT the quizzes will help you out with (2-4) pts daily!",1
"An easy A class, but Custer is one of the worst profs I've had at UD. He's extremely opinionated and seems to hate America. I was hoping to learn about the Native Americans but just learned that this guy has something bad to say about every president we've had except Obama... Anyway, hardly used the book, just write his opinion and you'll get an A",0
"Terrible teacher. Didn't grade any assignments until the middle of the quarter. I didn't know I was doing a bad job, so I didn't know I was supposed to improve. I had to drop out because of this. Very late grader, insane amounts of reading and participation. IF YOU REGISTERED IN HIS CLASS, GET OUT WHILE YOU CAN!!! Especially if you're a freshman.",0
"the lab assignments are fairly simple, but the tests are really hard. he gives you modules and expects you to learn everything on your own, so he really doesn't teach the class. you basically teach yourself. he's a nice guy, but not a great teacher",1
"I had Dr. Ball for comparative gov't. and international relations. Really easy classes, you have 20% of the test questions before hand. Read the material and attend class, easy  A. Refreshing viewpoints mixed with lively class discussions make his classes enjoyable.",1
"Susan McKenna is my daily confirmation for my decision to add a Spanish Education major to my existing one. She understands literature, characters, and the art of human being. Very comprehensible, accessible & natural teacher. Her passion and analysis of literature is unmatched. Her love of Spain & its people make the course.",1
"Fascinating lectures, but did not enjoy the class at all. Do not take this class unless you genuinely like rock and roll. You are given an insane amount of songs to listen to and memorize for the test. Don't think you can skip class. Whoever told you that was lying!!! Not a blow off class!!!!",1
He rabbles know your text book and your good his lectures are a waste of time you could use study the text.,0
"This class felt like a punishment. The homework and labs used computers and you didn't have to do anything by hand, but on the exams all you had to help you was a graphing calculator. Basically, you're getting testing on doing problems in ways they've never taught you. Hoffman is okay, but the structure of the class was ridiculous.",0
"Great Prof for meteorology. Gives clear feedback on your assignments, the tests are based almost exactly on the lectures and slides. Assignments are challenging but fair. Likes what he does!",1
"GOOD CLASS.  TESTS ON LECTURES, NOT BOOK.  DOES PURPOSEFULLY TRY TO TRICK HER STUDENTS ON EXAMS AND THAT IS SAD.  OVERALL GOOD TEACHER BUT BEWARE OF HER AS A PERSON SHE IS A TOUGH COOKIE.",1
"He kicks ass! Everyone should have him because he will make you think. The class can be hard because it so deep and sometimes draining. He grades hard on papers, but it helps a ton to take it into his office and have him look at before hand. One of the best teachers at Southwestern.",1
"WOW.. SHE IS VERY DIFFICULT DONT ASK QUESTIONS YOU WILL LOOK STUPID STUDY GUIDES ARE USEFUL, SHE MAKES AN EASY SUBJECT VERY DIFFICULT",0
"Loves to play ""gotcha"" on questions to take away points.  Worst class!!",0
"absolutely one of the smartest men I have ever come into contact with. the class is hard, but he makes it interesting and uses drawings and explanations in ways that make it understandable. besides this, he is GORGEOUS! definitely makes you pay attention",1
Appalling! Should've video record his lecture and compile a case consist of notes and test to show it to the ProfessorTeacher Community network and let them validate what being said in this review!,0
She is fantastic!,1
"Dr. Ahmad is the worst professor in the English department. By far. She is extremely unclear about her expectation. Midterm was 9 essay questions and she wanted 200 words per question. Written in class in 80 minutes. No question preview. Unless you're some sort of handish wizard who can work them like speedy Gonzales, avoid like the plague",0
"He is an amazing teacher and really tries to connect with the students in the class. He helps you whenever you need, and is very understanding. His class helped me realize what I want to do with my life.",1
Professor Kegler is an all around amazing guy. I highly recommend the class even if you are done with your fine arts requirement. As long as you show up and show progress on the piano you'll definitely ace the class.,1
"Textbook was dry, his lectures were dry, and his power points were poorly organized (some were in document form). However, the professor was nice and he tried to make jokes. Overall, not a difficult class (it is an introductory course after all) but could have been made easier with better study material.",0
I was one of the people that didnt drop her class even after reading these reviews and it cost me. AVOID this evil lady at all costs!! She did not let me make up 1 lab of 1 week before in order for me to qualify for the NC grade. I attended all her classes and that was the first lab I missed. I have never come across someone so evil in my life,0
"Absoulte worst teacher I have ever had. On several occasion the Dean had to sit in on our classes because of problems people had with her. If she liked you, you got a good grade, if not you are screwed on the test. I am a solid 4.0 student and recieved a 2.5 in her class.",0
Tough Grader but class is good,1
The Professor believes every student is as knowledgeable as he is and holds you to those standards. Lectures consist of only going over the homework you did the night before and clarifying a few things. Tests are hard and not really like the homework whatsoever so I would encourage that you attending SI sessions every week.,0
"As someone who struggles with math, Dr.Brown was the best choice as a teacher. He is always willing to help his students. He'll stop during class and explain something over if you need him to. There are opportunities for retakes on tests. There isn't homework or quizzes. If you put in the effort, you will pass. TAKE HIS CLASS !! (:",1
"Absolutely, 100% the worst, most boring prof ever. SO arrogant! He assigns thousands of pages of reading, which he never addresses and are not on the test (so dont bother doing it). His prompts are super vague, his grading is tough, and all he wants is for students to regurgitate his lectures back onto tests. I learned nothing.",0
He's a living textbook. He wrote the textbook and the way it is written is the way he speaks and writes. He is extremely intelligent and concise; a great academic but a terrible (by it's most primitive definition) teacher.  Not one of his lectures I came out with any understanding. (You think i'm kidding...) If you are a self teacher you will be OK,1
"Terrible professor, avoid at all costs. She's horribly disrespectful and the class is difficult only because she gives unclear grading criteria. She uses too many group projects to avoid having to lecture. Participation points are given arbitrarily and will bring down your grade. Worst professor I've ever had.",0
"He made the students do too much leg work for his grading (yes, you grade each other). He's pretty arrogant, and he makes it clear your opinions mean little to him. The class is ridiculously heavy. There isn't anything you can learn in this class that you can't learn off the internet. Really disappointed, especially with the amount of group work.",0
"Corlett's teaching style is a mix of conservative and by the books. While the topics/questions asked in class were great for discussion, I spent most of the time trying to copy enough notes to study. I also spent a lot of time outside of class trying to memorize the book and notes word for word for 2 exams. Overall wish I couldve gained more.",0
"The class itself was not hard. The material was pretty straight forward, especially if you read. Lab, however, was not structured well at all, it took months for assignments to be graded, and the professor flew through procedure and was concerned more about keeping up his aforementioned tough persona than actually teaching.",0
"Class was 1 hour credit Backyard Physics. Prof is fun, entertaining, easy to contact and communicated very well (and respectfully!) via email. His lectures are TERRIBLE. Some are so bad I literally could not tell what he was saying. I expect he's a lot better in a classroom than online, and probably easier to understand if you're a science major.",1
"She goes through her notes extremely fast so you have very little to write down the powerpoints and what she says. She tests on the textbook and lecture but focuses on the book, and her exams are mostly written with only a few MC. I feel she marks very hard and that if you do not regurgitate word for word you dont do well. So studying is required!",0
Great teacher. She doesn't ask for a lot but she is really big on APA. We had a lot of group projects which is pretty cool. She is very understanding and easy to work with.,1
"Very nice lady and can tell she is passionate about what she does, but does not communicate with the students well. She doesn't follow the syllabus and is scatter-brained. However, it is a somewhat-easy class and is an easy grader. She does boring lectures and if you hate group projects, you're gonna hate this class because it is nothing but that. ",0
"He did not hand back any of our assignments, so no one had any idea how they were doing. The lab manual is wordy and sometimes confusing (which makes sense because he wrote it). Take genetics lab with someone else.",0
"Get used to crazy laughter, odd jokes, and hearing, ""Okay, please don't carry on your own convrsations"". Oh, and of course you get to trek down to the LRC to study for the final, which is art taped to the wall, but she's an okay teacher overall.",1
"She is the most ridiculous professor at Adelphi. Class is a big discussion that drags on for hours and serve no purpose, assignments are graded with ridiculous expectations, i spent $100 on books we never used, you miss a class you fail. If you have a class with her DROP IT AND SAVE YOURSELF worst class i've ever experienced. do not recommend",0
"This class is graded by the ""B contract"" if you do all your work and go to class, you'll get a B. You read the NY times every week and he lectures a lot. It was a little disorganized for my taste and classes were a bore, but he's so kind and caring about his students. Not a hard class, just a lot of busy work.",1
"I took SOC 301, 302, and 312 with Dr. Kebede. He is hilarious I love his cheetah joke! For 312 online, there are 5 short notes, 5 quizzes, and 1 paper. He grades easy on the paper. Quizzes are somewhat confusing but not too bad if you read the textbook. He responds emails quickly. ",1
"best of a kind, book his class before full Marketing tactics Genius You'll Pass unless you yourself Screwup",1
"Very fair course. Yes, I won't lie, his lectures are quite unclear, but if you follow along in the book and do all the homework you will do fine in this class. The tests were difficult and there's a quiz almost every class but just put in the work. very nice and he will help you if you seek it. Take him over sepinsky.",0
"Only 5 grades are calculated. Three exams with option to put do not record to not include it in the calculation of your grade + the final. There is a lot of information to grasp, and the exams are difficult. I went to every lecture and had an A in homework. Expect to spend a lot of time out of class trying to understand the material on your own.",0
"Im assuming hes a wonderful literature professor. Hes a terrible at philosophy. Hes very knowledgeable, but he tried to teach philosophy like it was literature.",1
This class is a hybrid so pretty much everything is done online. She doesn't teach well and isn't helpful and office hours are pointless. Lecture is used to go over the ch that was assigned online the week before and to take a test. She doesn't answer questions even if its about a test. The class average is an F. I don't recommend this class.,0
"Amazing amazing. I took my first philosophy class, and first college class with him - life changing. His method will definitely get you to think - and make you realize you need to think. Tough grader, but man is it worth it. Everything you go through seems brilliant and flawless at first, then he tears it up - till you master that same art yourself",1
"Great Prof!!! Very knowledgable and helpful!!  But make no mistake, this is oone very hard class- the exams especially are very very difficult!!",1
"I LOVE prof Rashid. She is the best spanish professor that i've had so far at Wayne and have continued to take 3 of her other spanish courses. She is very helpful and friendly and explains things well! She is funny and a great teacher I definitely recommend her. She likes you to attend her lectures though, so try not to be late. A very fair grader.",1
"worst professor at York! Hasn't updated the course material in 20 years. Who the hell watches Buffy the Vampire Slayer? Knows nothing about popular culture even though he claims expertise. He probably wrote the ratings which say he ""pulls no tricks"" since no student talks like that.",0
Awful. Honestly the worst,0
"Over ten years ago, he taught me not just how to think, but how to think for - and believe in - myself.",1
"He is really into what he's teaching. He wants everyone to do good in the class and he ""coaches"" you to be your best.",1
IMPOSSIBLE PROFESSOR. MORE THAN HALF THE CLASS FAILED. UNHELPFUL. MAKES PROBLEMS UP FOR HIS EXAMS. Exams had 4-5 problems each and they were each worth 22-25 points. no extra credit.,0
"The accent is difficult but once you get used to it (and most of us did), you realize that she really knows her stuff and really cares about teaching.  Just make the extra effort and you'll be fine.",1
"Kristi always tells us to communicate with her if there are any questions/issues, but she never replies. She isn't clear with what she wants and is a very, very slow grader. Wants us to have long responses to other people's posts but there's not much to talk about. Lectures are just videos after videos. Why am I paying money just to watch videos?",0
By far the worst professor experience ive had at UST. Tests and quizes are near impossible. Doesnt give anyone 100% participation even if you participate very often. Found that his online quiz questions were online and screamed at the whole class for a whole class period. Would not recommend this professor to ANYONE... Highly disappointed.,0
I love history and I always have. I took AP history classes all throughout high school. I've been in Professor Hardy's class for three weeks and he is making me loathe history. The memorization of exact specific dates and populations is absurd and ridiculous. By far the worst instructor I've ever had.,0
"Professor Bellamy is not a good professor at all. His grading system consists of a homework grade and a test grade, and whichever is lower is your average. 2 of the tests are kind of easy, but one is very hard and it will ruin your average. He is also not good at explaining anything.",0
"Chrissy is THE most inclusive, caring and kindhearted teacher at state. Taking her class will boost your GPA and inspire you to come to class and learn what she has to share! A couple tests online, some discussion papers with easy/personal prompts and that is about it! Chrissy is such a light and amazing energy to have in your day!!",1
"If you want to learn something, do not take him. There is definitely something mentally not right with him, he is constantly off topic. I went to every class, did every assignment like an idiot and got an A. Meanwhile people who never showed got an A- because it was 'easier' for him to deal with. Worst English class and experience ever.",0
"Alan is so knowledgeable about Political Science. If you skip class, read the book and it'll be fine but if you don't want to read, go to class and it'll be fine. His tests are extremely hard because he has high expectations. He will help you if you ask and 20% of your grade are extremely easy context exercises. The class does take a lot of work.",1
"Ill state the obvious, theres a lot of writing involved in this class. Be prepared to write at least one page each week, 3-5 page papers every couple weeks. The good part is he breaks it down so writing is easy. He tells you exactly what to write. You cant go wrong. Lots of in class participation also. Great instructor!",1
"He's an extremely approachable professor who likes to see his students learn. I would definitely recommend him for Village Records as he makes the experience so much more interesting, taking his students into the student with him to learn how the recording process works. It was really awesome to see how he goes about layering a song for artists.",1
"She is a nice person but not when it comes to class. She doesn't talk to you in a way that motivates you if anything, she brings you down. She is hard to talk to because she is not very understanding and sometimes gets upset very upset fast.",0
"DO NOT TAKE! If you ask a question she refers you back to the syllabus where the info is not laid out clearly. You have a quiz on Monday night,  HW due on Wednesday, Voice Thread Replies due on Thursday, and she assigns her exams on a Tuesday night from 8-1130 and will not change the time frame!!!!",0
"spent hours upon hours with the book, in his help sessions and at his desk. he tried 1 approach for explaining and that was it-said it over & over. referred to the book which was equally obtuse. finally met a mate who could offer another perspective and it clicked. tim's nice but stubborn in his style and surprisingly unhelpful in his helpfulness.",0
Very good with feedback and answering emails. Big grader on APA formatting pay close attention,1
"I would have had higher grade if I just attended the study sessions with classmates. Smoller does not clearly explain many concepts and the lectures are a waste of three hours. I recommend setting up a groupchat with fellow classmates in order to actually grasp the subject matter because if you actually want to learn finance, avoid her at all costs",0
Goes off on tangents. Easy class. Great reading material.,1
"Dont take this class. She expects too much. She wants you to do every week reflective journals and written assignments which are about 5-6 paragraphs long. Also we write in class for a grade. Attendance mandatory have to be on time, and 3 times you miss class she will drop you. Too much stress.",1
"Lynch really really loves China. Should rename the class The Chinese Economy in Global Affairs or something. He misses lectures a lot and is difficult to reach by email. My TA was wonderfully helpful, but Lynch was not clear at all.",0
"Dr. Streit  says ""No extra credit, No exceptions."" When our class of 200 took her final exam, not one person made an A, the highest grade was an 86. The class average for our final was a 59, and she was not even in the United States the week before, or the week of finals. The class was too difficult, considering it was for non science majors.",0
She's very nice but tends to be annoying with remembering names at times. I'm currently taking the class this semester but so far she's really sweet.,0
"Reads off powerpoint, doesn't explain anything. When she tries explaining she messes up and only confuses you more. Students corrected her on every quiz and exam because there was something wrong. Heavy accent which makes her more difficult. No curving, class grades are set lower although. Easiest Ochem professor at CSU although,just teach yourself",0
"She's a good teacher, I just think she was trying to do something new. She had us write blog entries, which I'd never done before, and all we really had to do was read. There were a lot of quizzes, but you automatically got one point (usually 5 questions) for your name and they're just based on the books we read. Good books, fun discussion.",1
"Took the class online-- very unorganized. She kept announcing extended due dates but was not very clear about which ones they were(the announcements were pretty jumbled). She seems nice, just hard to follow. Grades pretty easy though.",0
"Prof. Rodgers is extremely knowledgeable and enthusiastic when it comes to biology. The subject matter is tough, but she's very detailed and always willing to answer questions during class. She's a lovely person who cares about her students, and I'm grateful to have had the opportunity to learn from her.",1
"He is terrible, heavy lectures, doesnt write on the board, tough grader, everything is hard. If you are not that smart dont take him. Personality: nice guy",0
"Good experience with prof Orta, I took the class online and really enjoyed it. The structure of the content was nice, she was very responsive, and the class was interesting. Not the type of class for students who are used to plagiarizing or copying quiz answers from quizlet, but a very comprehensive learning experience. Thank you professor!",1
"Great professor, probably my fav professor ever.",1
"Mr. Person is a very nice and respected gentleman. He was a police officer for many years as well as a dispatcher. He is now a security officer at Enloe Hospital in Chico. He does not lecture on the stuff that will be on test, but when he does it is brief. He will go through the book and tell you each word you need to know for the test. Easy A!",1
Probably the worst chemistry teacher at Bradley. Doesn't explain things you need to know for the test and talks about things that are irrelevant. Gives quizzes every single day and the problems he gives are pretty much impossible. The way that he explains things are also way harder than it needs to be.,0
"Had her as one of my professors during the first semester of the pandemic, she was the only prof i had who did not give extensions on assignments and was not understanding/caring AT ALL to students needs. If you have something personal happening in your life dont expect her to be lenient with you.",0
"Weird prof.  Not always in a good way, either.  Most students seemed to like her, I'm just not one.  Very easier class though.",0
It was his first time teaching INT422. Lectures were slow and confusing. Course was scary because 4 weeks in he's taught me almost nothing. You have to self learn everything.,0
"Professor Steiner is the best. She really does care for her students, if you are struggling she will stay with you after class. Supper nice and caring, she wants you to pass the class and learn the material too.",1
"Great professor! He knows his material well. His tests can be a bit lenghty, but they are doable. The jokes are one of the best parts of the class.",1
"It is a problem hearing him so sit in front of class. What he says is VERY IMP since he gives hints as to what is gonna come in the exam. For ECE 380, he had two sets of lecture notes whose examples you should really focus on. Do previous exams since he has a pattern to what he asks.",0
"She is an Ok professor but would not take her again. She does come off rude. Be prepared for group projects. 3 exams, 1 presentation, and 1 research paper. Her Exams are hard to follow but study the powerpoints, participate in class, go to class and you will eventually pass. Her lectures are long. She goes off-topic while lecturing sometimes.",1
"If you don't do well on the homework, you WILL fail the tests. Test questions are sometimes verbatim from homework assignments so make sure you do well on them and understand them.",0
"Was very condescending whenever I asked him for help. After an email for an explanation of a mark he replied he thought the mark he assigned was reasonable and if I were him I should take it. His lecture slides are cutouts from the text book. He doesn't know what he is teaching us in class, after reading his slide he said ""oh I didn't know that""",0
"Excellent for 108. NOT for 201.  I was 2% away from passing and I only missed one class AND did tutoring, and she didn't care.  Only cares about smart students or those in front row. Rude outside of class. She got corrected EVERY class period.  not a good teacher for 201",0
"She is an amazing profesor! I absolutely love her.. she is not an easy A but you need to work and come on this is college, so expect to work. She is an adjunct professor and is very nice, although she has very good eye don't intend to use your cell phone she will call you out on it. I loved her class i got a B+",1
Absolutely amazing prof. He is clear in his lectures and provides some great personal anecdotes and examples. Would absolutely recommend to anyone. Very helpful in providing feedback as well.,1
One of the best profs I've had.  Highly intelligent with professional experience in her field.,1
Unapproachable and unfriendly. This professor should not be teaching. It seems that she loves taking points off of papers and assignments. She will admonish you for asking a simple question. Avoid her.,0
"Whatever you do, avoid this professor. I am a 4.0 GPA student and couldnt get my grades up for this course which led me to withdraw. Before taking this course, I read these reviews and gave it the benefit of the doubt. WORST MISTAKE EVER. So many students are failing or struggling and he obviously doesn't think he has something to do with the issue",0
Gets angry and annoyed when asked questions or advice to understand something which makes me avoid asking questions altogether. Uses different notations in lectures compared to textbooks which is confusing as homework is assigned from the textbook exercises. Overall i would avoid her courses and take up the same course taught by other instructors.,0
I would take this class every semester until I graduate if that was practical.,1
this guy should not teach history at all. he makes it a bit harder as it shouldn't be. quite rude and isn't really clear of what he's teaching. tries to make it fun but does a bad job doing that. he is an ok teacher but would definitely not take another class with him. class would have been more interesting if I took it with someone else.,0
Probably the most boring class I've taken so far. I was really interested in taking anthro but after this class I never want to take another one. Tests can be hard if you're not good at memorizing textbooks quotes. If you want to take anthro take a different professor and avoid Borg.,0
Wonderful professor who really cares about what she does. Even though this class is online she is very interactive with the students and makes the topic interesting!,1
"Ummm....totally unorganized!  Does not tell you what she expects and is not clear about papers, projects, or presentations.  Very absent-minded!",0
"He lacks of the background in R and tableau, which made students confused about the class. and the grading criteria is very vague, but he is a ok grader. I got a B+ at the end, and paid ok effort into it. I won't recommend his class but sometimes there is no other choice since there are only a few instructors at MIS department.",0
Dan was by far one of the hardest teachers ive ever had. he is not helpful and does not care about his students. he doesnt teach the class very well and doesnt make sure the class is understanding what he is saying. dont take him!!!!,0
"Great prof. Requires you to do the work, but if you do, then you do fine.",1
"She is very smart and quite demanding. The text is hard even for native speakers (I met one on an airplane and asked for help interpreting). There is a lot of writing, like 3-5 pages, in french. Her english communication is not great so it's hard to ask questions for clarification. She'll never remember your name, even with only 8 people in class.",0
"Wonderful, caring professor but be prepared to read and work for your mark.",1
"Prof. Klein is very soft-spoken. He will usually mumble to himself during lectures. The subject itself is not hard, however, his lecture style makes it difficult. I suggest watching some Khan Academy videos on Diff Eq and learn Klein's notations for his exams. Learn the homework and quizzes, as they are usually exam questions.",0
i dread going to class every day,0
DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR UNLESS YOU WANT TO GET A BAD GRADE. EXTREMELY TOUGH GRADER. VERY HARD TO GET AN A IN HIS CLASS. SIGN UP FOR ANOTHER PROFESSOR.,0
"I've gone to several office hours to ask more specific questions, and I found him to be rude and condescending. He will help you, but be prepared to feel like an idiot for asking. The first test was similar to the homework problems, but the final was unnecessarily difficult. Find another teacher, if you can. He was awful.",0
:(,0
She is very unorganized. Doesn't give clear instructions on what she expects to be turned in.  You must teach yourself. Exams are almost never similar to the study guides. At first seems nice but it all changes. Class goes from being full to only 17 people by the end. If I knew she was this bad I would of never taken her class. ,0
"He is very easy going and cool ,explains very clear ,does not t waste any time at all ,very good sense of humor ,perfect grader , he would make the road clear and easy for you to go trough and all the time gives you motivation and ideas for success ,one of the best professors I ever had in whole college semesters, I definitely recommend it .",1
"Does little to nothing to make lectures engaging in anyway. Goes on several tangents unrelated to the course. I took this class because I thought philosophy would be interesting, and maybe it is, but with Rogers I would have no idea. The tests are opinionated to her own views on philosophers, and terribly worded. Thanks for ruining a subject for me",0
"Good man, very nice, but shouldn't be teaching anymore. First quiz was very easy, midterm was very hard due to poorly worded questions. Second quiz should have been easy but like his previous exams there were mistakes riddled throughout. Average for the class rn is maybe around a 50 (you can see everyones grade).S/U-covid is saving my GPA luckily.",0
"This guy is a total jacka$$, he does not care to help students instead he set up ways to fail you. He is so rude.",0
"His voice is literally the most monotone voice I have ever heard in my life, especially with a lecture at 9am it is impossible to not want to fall asleep. The content is interesting at times but overall he isn't too exciting to listen to. Good thing he posts everything online.",0
DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR.,0
He honestly should not be teaching math at all. This class is a joke! He is extremely unclear when he teaches and he makes solving problems 10x harder than they actually are. He also freaks out about the smallest things! Avoid taking him.,0
"amazing class, amazing teacher. he will really bring out your creative side. probably the funniest person ever. it's a lot of work, but it's fun.",1
Holly is extremely knowledgeable but not very approachable. I found her rubrics hard to follow and very nit picky.  IDK if graphic design is just like that but she should keep in mind that this is a required foundation class for all majors.,0
"Nice nice nice guy. But, so so so boring. The class wasn't very engaging.. which made it fairly hard. I ended up with a B+, which I have NO idea how. But idk the class has potetial to be interesting but I just couldn't. Don't necessarily avoid the class or avoid this teacher, but avoid both if you have classes youre more engaged in.",0
"I disagree with anyone recommending tonks, ok maybe compared to other professors he is ok, but seriously this class is brutal",0
"Honestly really awful professor. Doesn't care about his students, no participation from students because his class is so dry and boring. He's very rude and opinionated. Never stays on topic of class and class was NOT what I signed up for. Easy exams. Don't do projects.",0
He is an amazing class. I changed my major but I am still glad that I took his class. He was funny and always interesting. I was never bored in his class. The test are really easy. At the end of the semester if he notices that you are close to the next grade up and thinks you deserve it he will give it to you.,1
"An intro to data analysis class should be helpful for all students to learn how to use excel, but this professor is so old fashioned that the assignments are totally impractical and I didn't learn anything usable. Despite working hard on all assignments, attending class, and studying hard in a group for exams, I didn't do as well as I should have.",0
"Barely showed up for this class & passed with an A grade. You can skip his lectures, but DO NOT SKIP review day! He gives his EXACT exam questions so be sure to write it all down & print it on his allowed 1-page cheat sheet. He doesn't check his homework so I just passed HW1 for all the homeworks and changed the name to HW2, HW3, so on. Easy A",0
Morales-Ortiz constantly returned graded papers (needed for exams) back VERY late or not at all. He would often be caught playing video games in his office instead of working. He was clearly unable to convey much of the taught material at all to much of our class. His lectures consisted of disjointed rambling which themselves were very confused.,0
"Somewhat boring but very straightforward and gives examples where he can. Disappointing lack of in-class demos. Quizzes are easy and consist of a couple definitionexample-based questions each (everything is in the notes). Warning: DO NOT DO THE FINAL PROJECT ALONE! You have to write a 10-page report, single-spaced. Find a group. Mostly easy class.",1
"This was the worst prof I ever had. Don't bother taking her. She is so rude, very un understanding and extremely tough grader. You have to do everything exactly the way she wants it or you will fail. Her lectures are also extremely boring . Also make sure you're never late because she will take points off.",0
"Horrible, don't even know why he is the only acct 102 professor. Does not help you in any kind of way and just expects you to know it and if you don't then tough. Wish there were other professors teaching this course so i could have switched... now I'm stuck with him and he is useless. He doesn't teach and doesn't explain anything.",0
"Be ready to read, read, and read. Tests are ridiculously hard. But if you read the chapters about 5 times you might get that A you want. Her class is doable but just make sure you read a lot.",0
"hard grader, hard to understand, always adds more things to do for a paper when you are halfway done or done, so then you have to go back and add all the things he now wants you to do. ALL about the details, details, and more details. All you do is write papers the entire semester. Occasional quizzes and exercises.",0
"The classes are extremely slow, heavy, and redundant. Her teaching method is very confusing unless you ask specific questions and get the answer youre looking for. Resources on blackboard are all over the place so it will take you a while to find the correct resource for the assignment youre working on.",0
"I thought CMST would not be that hard at all. This teacher makes it 10 times harder than it should be. Her quizzes are outrageously hard even if you study for them, read the textbook, and listen to the podcasts. She talks WAY too much she usually only gets through a slide per class. She is a tough grader. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS WITH HER",0
"Easy going and laid back prof, fair midterm.  Too bad we only did derivative-based optimization.  Would love to see some derivative-free optimization.",1
"I have never rated a professor before but I feel I should aware people that Professor Orta is a very hard and difficult teacher. She assigns SO much homework (reading, discussion boards, papers) and doesnt give you enough time to even complete them. I feel she doesnt even give good feedback on the assignments. Try picking a different teacher!",0
"He doesn't help students when they need him. His lectures missed a lot of things in the curriculum. Scholz would not give you any practice exams, remove access to lecture and Mastering Physics in the last days and his test is somewhat unfair and irrelevant to what we learnt in class.",0
"greenberg is a very nice guy and always willing to help w/ questions. lectures arent very worthwhile but the material isnt that hard. hw is weekly and not very difficult. two midterms and a final, midterms very fair, nothing we hadnt seen before. offered study sessions before tests which were helpful. i recommend this class",1
"Very unclear, in class, and in exams.",0
This teacher is the bomb! She takes a boring class and makes it fun. She one of the best teachers. She cares about her students and is very fair. I am taking another class with her becuse she is awesome!,1
Makes the class interesting and teaches very well.,1
Cool guy but he rushes through the lectures and expects you to know what you're doing.  Gives a lot of extra credit and assigns little homework. The test are basically the study guides he provides you. Does not prepare you for final. Don't take him if math isn't your strong suit. *heavy accent*,0
Professor Mattson is a great professor. He's really nice and helpful. Just make sure you do your blogposts on time and you'll be golden. I enjoyed his class and met awesome people.,1
"She will read directly from the book with no added clarity. Difficult exams. Will not give you enough time to take exams. Have a question? Read the rubric, she won't help you. If you do not do projects exactly the way she wants them done, she will torch your grade. Unimaginative, uninspiring, just plain ""un."" Worst instructor I've ever had.",0
Dr. Fontenot is a very uninvolved professor. He lectures every class period but is essentially saying the same thing every class time. The class also required at least 5 books when I took it. He does not really give clear instructions on tasks and is reluctant to work with students who need help. He does end class early almost every day though.,0
"Very personable, nice and understanding! Made a course packet with all the notes so its very easy to follow lecture. All the exam study guides are available at the beginning of the semester and she does a great job including everything that will be on the exam in the study guides. Easily one of my favorite professors! Offers a few EC opportunites",1
The homework is completely different than the exams and her notes are a little confusing and disorganized. Danko made Accounting tough but if you are ready to study it is passable.,0
"Took him this past fall semester, no pop quizzes, no open book tests. Test are 2 questions, but thats all you really have time for tbh. Equation sheet allowed. There's homework, but only for practice because it's not graded. Hands out his notes which is helpful so we can focus on the lecture better. This is a tough class in itself, tough material.",1
"Not a bad class, but she can be very condescending",0
"He is an amazing English professor. The first week he can seem weird, but as you get to know him and his ethics he becomes a fantastic teacher whom others should look up too. He made a normally boring class quite enjoyable. He encourages creativity highly.",1
"If you are willing to work, he will help you.",1
"useless teacher, he doesnt even show up half the time for classes, doesnt teach anything, he makes us read the vague textbook, idiot teacher.",0
"Very, very monotone. Difficult to understand. Did meet with students during non class hours. Very nice person to person. Only take him if you have no other choice.",0
"The man LOVES to hear himself talk. He seemed like he enjoyed telling students about his own writing, rather than helping them with their own writing.  His class was okay though.  Not too hard.  Not too easy.  I hated it when he weaved politics into the nonpolitical class.  He's a commie.",1
"Dr. Conner has retired following my semester with him, but I want to write this anyway. He is both an extraordinary professor, and an extraordinary man. His lectures are penetrating and informative, and he is a joy to talk to (about anything) outside of class. It was an honor to take one of the final courses he taught, I learned so much.",1
"Pozzi is everything that is wrong with GVSU's Spanish department. They need to get rid of the weak professors who have no clue how to teach like Pozzi and Fidalgo and employ strong teachers like Serrata. She is very egotistical and does not support you if you are trying to succeed. In addition, she is a sexist and should not be teaching a capstone.",0
Grading was very confusing throughout the semester. Lectures are hard to follow and typically go over class time. Lectures are also all powerpoints so it is easy to get bored. Most directions for assignments are not clearly stated and do not have a rubric to see what he is looking for. Would not recommend or retake a class with him again.,0
"I had him as my prof; when he loses his temper, he will become a wild aggressive attacker. why is he teaching us?",0
"Pire prof que j'ai eu a ce jour, aucune explications utile vous devrez vous preparer vous meme pour les examens a l'aide du livre",0
He's a great professor.  He makes you work for the grade that you deserve.,1
"He's a nice guy, but I can't understand half the things he says which makes me not want to pay attention.",0
Sure she knows her stuff on political analysis but she is a horrible professor. Pop quizzes on the days most kids are absent(like the day b4 thanksgiving) and 7 memos total in the class. She couldn't care less about her students and literally makes sure they do bad. The class is extremely boring and she makes sure we go overtime every class.,0
I have never read so much and learned so little.,0
"Idk where this lady gets off with all the time consuming assignments. Would never take again, ridiculous workload and unfair quizzes",0
Stewart is very particular. He likes things to be very precise so when doing assignments or essays keep in mind that he wants you to be detailed--almost painstakingly so...,1
"Challanging material. She is great, personalble, helpful and challenging. Take her.",0
"I took this class because I was told it would be an easy A.  It was not that easy though.  There is a lot of required reading and hw every week. The final Exam was the worst exam I have ever taken at MD.  Also, just this semester he is requiring $50 clickers that you have to buy. Take it with another professor!!!!",0
looks like a Goblin from Harry Potter but awesome guy,1
a very good lecturer compared to most,1
best professor I ever had!!,1
"You will teach yourself in this course!!! If you want an easy class, do not take this course! There are three tests and you need to get 270 points total to get an A. Each weekly homework assignment takes 2-3 hours. He does tell you which problems will be on the test though and he lets you out early.",0
"Metzger is the worst professor I think I've ever had. IF YOU HAVE HER DROP NOW. She doesn't address the class until 20 minutes after class begins, she expects you to learn on your own, and she calls last names from the role to answer questions in lieu of teaching.  Your grade is based on 6 tests and a presentation.  Avoid at all costs.  Seriously.",0
Sociology what? Is there such a science? Don't know cause I didnt learn anything.,0
"Seems like a great teacher if you take his class in person. I, however, took his class online and it was not great. He words instructions poorly, his grading expectation is that you photograph your notebook work and submit that instead of using ExploringStatistics or another online module (What?) for homework, & doesn't list test dates in syllabus.",0
"Dr. H expects way too much out of you for a gen ed. class.  She touches on topics for a brief period and then expects you to know everything in her mind. She babbles tons in class and is very disorganized with explanations  Do NOT take her class if you can avoid it. Tests are poorly constructed and subjective to ""how she feels"" like grading you.",0
"Amazing prof! Knows what he's talking about, negotiable and approachable in office hours, and once you get past the accent, will explain anything you ask well and passionately. Definitely taking another course with him.",1
Need to talk loundly,0
I've done very well in Spanish in the past and I didn't pass this class. Tests were massive and very specific she takes points off like mad. You have daily homework and the quizzes are with a big chunk of the grade. She moved super quickly through the material. Do not recommend,0
"Make sure you read, study all your notes even the book notes, and prepare to write essays for exams. She is a difficult grader and is very specific of what she wants. Make sure you go to class you may miss out on important information and the attendance points are great at the end to have. Ask many questions. She can be confusing at times.",0
"I took his class because I had no other option. This professor does not help you at all and expects you to do things by yourself. He does not teach any programming expects how to calculate sum of two numbers and basic stuff. He makes alot of mistakes and says, "" I am not like other profs whk prepare their lectures at home. I do everyrhing here.""",0
"Took this class online during the pandemic and the prof was so hard to contact. He put an announcement that the first test was open however for the second one he did not and a handful of people missed the second test, myself included, however it took two weeks to receive any contact & I had to contact the assistant dean. Do not take if it's online.",0
"i love this lady! had her for spanish 1 & 2, she is really laid back but assigns homework every class and her tests are pretty long, and she marks you wrong for capital letters, missing accents, and misspelling words.",1
"I had Dr. Ibrahim over the summer and as hard as the class was, I appreciated him. While his tests are hard, because the grading scale is so curved, you can get a good grade if you work hard enough. Many students struggled to finish the exam in time and he understood the complications with an online class - students were given additional time.",1
"I can't figure out if he is a ****, or if he just needs to work on his delivery. He said some very strange things during his lectures...I am not sure if I would recommend htis course - on one hand, the pass/fail assignments can really boost your mark. On the other hand, you will really need it because his tests were extremely hard.",0
"Dr. Alexander is the best Bible Professor at Harding. He lectures, and gives test. That is all you have to do, just pay attention and learn the material.",1
"this class was death. m/c test based mostly on lectures. not good test of your actual knowledge. took 2 weeks to get back to me on whether or not i could rewrite the essay. no final. blah, boring.",0
Tom is by far the best teacher I had at UNL. He cares about your future and the class has helped me prepare for my career. Definitely try to meet within at least once throughout the semester as he is very knowledgeable and can help you with almost anything. Very inspirational class.,1
"Mr. Skrzypek obviously cares about his students, and he is always willing to help. The subject material is difficult, but Mr. S makes it interesting. Also, I personally think his jokes are funny. If you have to take an upper level philosophy course I recommend a course taught by Mr. S! ",1
Easy class. Very interesting material. Very spread out so you don't have stuff due every week. Discussions are like little projects that take some time but are very fun. It's impossible to fail unless you actually just don't do anything. 3 tests- no time limit. Easy A. I have a 99.8 %. Fun and interesting class. Great grade booster & its enjoyaBULL,1
Worst professor I have ever taken. Spends the 2 hour lecture sitting down and mumbling into his hand. Very rude and told my class everyone was going to fail every day. STAY AWAY FROM THIS MAN.,0
"He is by far the worst professor I've ever seen. He has a very thick accent and I barely understood what he was talking about. Not only he has a thick accent, but he also did not go through the materials very thoroughly. He will explain something without reason, and he expects you to understand the concept. He repeats stuff over and over again.",0
ELEG 310 is one of the most hardest class and it is also soo boring. He himself admits that this course is a hard course. The whole class is basically probability and a little bit of statistics.  He hates teaching this course because he is an EM professor but forced to teach this course. He curves at the end.,1
She taught me in FRSL 102. She was really considerate. She went over the quizzes and can8. Expect lots of homework and time dedication to the course. Amazing professor tho!,1
"extremely smart but sucks at teaching, assessing, and grading. He should be out there fixing our economy but instead is stuck teaching. Do not take him if you can, it was pretty rough. Unless you are in love with econ and have lots of time to teach yourself!",0
"Overall a great bio lab teacher, difficult tests but that's the norm in bio lab. Very helpful and willing to go over models/slides after class and during office hours. Very clear with expectations and notes, plus his British accent is pretty cool!",1
He wrote everything that was going to be on the test on the board in in an outline format. He was helpful and friendly with the students. He treated every question as if it was of utmost importance. He eve looked something up for me that had to do with a health issue my grandfather was having. Great teacher!!!!,1
"Hilarious. Entertaining and captivated the class with his excitement about the subject. Calls you out for cell phone use. Just show up, be respectful and itll be a breeze. ",1
"Best class, best professor. If you have any interest in drugs at all, TAKE THIS CLASS! Hes a really nice man, and is very passionate in his teaching. One project (paper &presentation) which was really managable & fair. One exam (the final) was easy if you studied, and there really is not excuse not to. Memorize 10 drugs, done. Definitly take this!",1
Melissa is a capable professor and I appreciated the quality of the class discussions. I suspect that some other students who didn't participate much or at all were disappointed with their final grade - as class participation was probably more of a 'real' criteria in this class than in others.,1
"Disorganized, unprofessional.",0
"It was a theme class,he acknowledged that, and i appreciated it! gives weekly quizzes, handed back assignments/tests faster than any professor i've ever had which helps with studying.  show up, pay attention, take good notes, STUDY. you will be fine, even if you suck at science. Minimal work load, and hes nice. tries to crack jokes too lol",1
"Although he is quite reknowned in his field, and obviously knows his stuff,  he often makes life difficult for the students.  He has two types of people: those who are useful to him and those that are not.  The lowly undergrad does not get much of a learning experience for the tuition $",0
Talks about himself his ex his wife his college days drinking doesn't get to the assignments. Did not enjoy his class So i dropped it. ,0
"I love Ms. Magallon! She is an excellent teacher and a great person. I did not think her essays were difficult at all, but others may disagree. Receiving feedback from her will help raise your essay grades, so get as much as possible! She is willing to help to her students to make sure they pass.",1
"Feedback is not clear, and never posted grades. Final exam was ridiculously difficult and-wrote for almost the entire time. Not specific in what you should study, and what was on the test wasnt well covered in class. No grade posted on the paper or exam! I would not recommend this class, regret taking this class. (Lowest grade this semester)",0
"The hardest class I've taken at Carleton, Professor Logan explains things to us as if we're math students. As someone who is not a math person I was floundering and I barely got by even with extra help.",0
"A lot of discussion board writing and 3 exams. He is a tough grader but as long as you try, I don't think you will fail this class. He wants you to improve on every discussion board and offers tips on how to write your discussions better. Highly recommend!",1
"I had to make an account just to write this review. Stassen is by far the worst professor Ive had. He makes absolutely no sense throughout lectures, leaving everyone very confused. His assignments have practically zero guidance and when you go into his MESSY office for help, he still makes no sense. Tests are very difficult to study for. Beware!",0
Worst.,0
"Go to class and truly pay attention to his lectures and you will excel in his class. He is very interesting in lecture and the midterm and final come straight from lectures and the homework readings. Only downside to the class is you have to write summary sentences for each homework reading, but if you do them it gets you easy points toward your A.",1
"Great professor. I recommend him to anyone who has no interest in poly-sci. He will make it interesting, understandable, and you will learn. He is very knowledgeable, adaptive, and nice.",1
i previously had assumed that professors needed some degree of intelligence. khalsa taught me never to assume anything.,0
"She does her best to make the lectures interesting. Pretty easy A if you go to lectures, do the online homework, and take the time to study before exams.",1
"There is no way you can fail this class. She WANTS everyone to get an A, and I wouldn't be surprised if everyone in my class did get an A. All exams are online, even the final. Sometimes it is confusing on when things are due but everything is pretty easy. Very nice lady, but talks about her son a little too much. Brought us candy all the time!",1
Professor Quinlan is incredible. You can tell he really cares about how his students are going and he does his best to help you succeed. I had my first class with him during the semester that we first got a stay at home order for Covid and he made the transition to online so easy for us. I'm in his class again now.,1
"Link is a very nice guy who knows what he's talking about, but lectures can get boring. He makes his own textbook that goes along with the lectures which is very helpful. There are study sessions outside of class every week which are very helpful, and he offers extra credit. I would take him again if I had the chance.",1
"He is one of the worst professors at CSUB. He has no pity for anyone & he is not helpful at all. He does not respond to e-mails, only if he wants to and when he wants to. Do not take classes with this man. ",0
"She's awesome. If you want a straight forward professor, she's the one for you. I recommend her to anyone who has a brain.",1
The BEST english teacher I have ever had!!  He was always helpful and understanding!!  Just the best teacher!!,1
"The assignments given were very confusing, and not much information is given to complete the assignments. I would not take this class if you are looking for a GPA booster as you put in a lot more work than expected for a first-year course. Would not recommend.",0
I totally agree. She's amazing! a super role model for young female intellectuals.,1
One of the most disrespectful professors I've ever had. She sent my whole class an email at the end of the semester telling us how bad we all did and pretty much saying it's all our fault and not hers. I've always been a good paper writer and got C's on all of hers. Wouldn't recommend.,0
"I loved taking this class, the teacher is extremely organized and lays out the material in a very clear way which makes this class a lot easier. You can tell she really cares about her students and will do anything to make sure they succeed in this class, and she also provides several extra credit opportunities.",1
"Professor Felber set the standard for what feedback should be in an online course.  I've only taken 10 online courses so far, but Felber was by far the most helpful professor that I've had.  Her work isn't the easiest, but she is very fair and consistent with her grading.",1
"A201 is a very hard subject be prepared to put in the work. Attend class and ask a lot of question during your discussion class. Seek help if you need it, it is out there. Attend class, read the book to get a better understanding of the material.",1
Dr. Merill is awesome! Her class is super fun and she really helps you to learn the information. The tests are fairly easy as long as you pay attention.,1
"I approached her before class about a packet I did not receive and she refused to talk to me, told me to sit down and talk to her after class, however I could not due to the fact that I go straight to work after her class is over. Then gave me 0/13 because I was missing the rubric FROM THE PACKET I WAS ASKING HER ABOUT. She's not forgiving at all!!",0
"Great teacher, he presents his material very clear. make you go to his office to ask questions because he has so much material in class to present. if your a baby who expects teachers to hand you a grade then don't take him. if you wanna learn then take this teacher. he is a hardas* but only to those who cry too much. great teacher, i learned alot.",1
"I would never recommend this class or professor to anyone. You only have 2 tests and a project for your total grades. The class is large, yet he still takes attendance every single day and if you miss more than 4 classes he automatically fails you. Anytime a students asks a questions he makes them feel  stupid. Lectures are very boring and long. ",0
"Very hard,does not give no breaks do not take his class,he does not give feedback. You will fail his class!!",0
Prof. Rico knows his stuff and is extremely intelligent but his lectures are hard to stay engaged. They are long and quite frankly uninteresting. Had to use the textbook to clarify sometimes but most content within the class is logic and not very difficult. Didnt do much studying and did well in the class.,1
Avoid at all costs!,0
"Very knowledgable, but a bit arrogant. Excellent lectures.  12 page research paper, but encourages you to ask for help. (Can be condescending when you do.)  Weekly discussion boards are 10% of your grade. Tests are hard, but he grades fairly. 3 essay questions which are unpredictable. You have only 75 minutes to do it. ",1
Loved every class Ive had with Mr. Williams,1
"Overall good prof, no issues with her or the class (GEOG101). Everything was graded very fairly and it was very easy to get a good grade on all the quizzes/exams as long you watched the lectures and take notes on the textbook chapter keywords. She expected us to read a lot but I never did.",1
"I took his intro to stats and social psych class. He has you spend hundreds of dollars on class materials instead of teaching. I have taught myself every chapter of both classes. He often doesn't respond to my emails when I am looking for help... which I need... because im teaching myself!!!!! The material isn't too hard, but still! So annoying!!!",0
"Gaffin has a bad reputation on here for being harsh and too strict with cell phones.  He never once came across as too strict or harsh or opinionated and he carefully chooses his words when dealing with sensitive topics.  Most students do not take kindly to sensitive topics in a ""Culture"" class, so that is why he is given a bad reputation.",1
This has been by far the most dumb class I've taken. He will talk and talk about absolutely nothing and miss stuff that is on the test. He's a good guy but honestly all the tests are terrible.,0
"Although knowledgeable, he is rude and clearly has trouble with English at times mocking students for using words ""incorrectly"", when he doesn't understand them himself. Totally disorganized course pack and his 'discussion' is often one-sided. Nice enough but completely arrogant.",0
"Taking Professor Corbett for Managing Justice Organizations and he's been a great professor. I don't know why some people commented that if you are not a police officer he doesn't care about what you have to say because I am certainly no police officer, in fact I work in the bedding industry, and he has always left motivating comments on my work.",1
He is the best prof  of all times !!! He is brilliant.,1
"Subject is easy but his tests and labs are made to make you do poorly.  If you read his notes and know how to deal with multiple choice, you should do well.  Lectures are boring and uses Microsoft Word.  No one sane would use that to show lecture slides.  And his multiple choice test are like -> look below.",0
"As a professor, she was the hardest grader I have ever had.  I would highly recommend staying away from this course if possible, based on the difficulty of her grading alone.",0
She's very unclear and doesn't give specific instructions. You have to beg her for help. ,0
"Her tone is always condescending. Especially since shes smiling 24/7, even when irritated. Her instructions can be extremely vague but then she's very specific about what she wants from you. If you miss class then that's at least 3 grades going in as a 0 cause she'll put the report that's due the next week in as a 0 as well",0
"She gives you details on what the course is about via a syllabus. Since it was an online course, any responses from students were taken via emails; in which she was ready to rely to many. Gives positive feedback after finishing their work, which is an easy pass.",1
"Mrs. Ramsey is a good professor. She lets you redo assignments, which is great.",1
Not an easy teacher.4 test which involve on average 4 chapters and alot of readings from another book. 2 papers one on a book and the other at the end of the course on a topic of her choice.,0
Taking this class was a huge mistake. Her tests are impossible and there were a bunch of them.,0
"Super full of herself. First class she said ""Don't pay attention to RateMyProfessor reviews."" Thinks she's the greatest teacher ever. Super condescending and rude. VERY clearly favors students for non-academic reasons. Whatever you do, avoid at all costs. Seriously.",0
"Ugh!  When learning assembly language, it helps to have a professor who knows what she's talking about.  She lectured and answered questions straight from the book, and gave HUGE homework assignments with minimal help.  Not enough time on tests, either.",0
"Best professor Ive had so far ! Deeply cares about his students and his job. Accessible for office hours, even if you arent a student of his ! Hes very dedicated. Easy homework, fair exams, amazing lectures! Easy A if you show up and give it tour best efforts.",1
his accent is confusing. his lecture is confusing. very little help when it goes to the project!,0
Great professor! 3 exams and absolutely no homework. I would recommend taking him! He didn't take attendence either,1
"Fun class, but it'll take up a lot of your time (e.g. short videos). Highly recommended if you're interested in learning Mandarin.",1
"He is legit a real life Disney protagonist, has a great sense of humor, likes to throw interesting trivia into the course topics, and is also very nice to talk to. Very helpful in office (cause tbh I really couldn't) wrap any of the logic around my head) and is also very energetic lecturer!",1
"I didn't use the textbook once. Wejksnora is very passionate about biology. He makes hilarious examples, and asks you questions if you sit in the front row. I missed an exam for no reason and he let me retake it even though I told him two months later. Definitely a great professor. ",1
His handwriting is so horrible! omg! I can't tell what he thinks of my work.,0
"Easiest A, best professor, super helpful and caring, take Dr. B no matter what. She actually wants to help, and is happy to reach out",1
"very smart, gives good notes, class is so boring though only downside",1
"This guy is useless. I took his online class and he never helped you and was a real jerk. He felt as if he was invincible when speaking over e-mail. Oh well, what else do you expect when a coach teaches?",0
"I never trust Rate My professor, except in the rating of this guy. So horrible. Please take him out of U Ottawa",0
"Took in fall 20 online because of pandemic. Good professor, very fun and passionate about the class. Mandatory to attend zoom class. Will be working a lot in groups with classmates in breakout rooms. Participation is a must, two textbooks needed and one presentation for the final but it is not hard. Gives lots of assignments but not long.",1
Lectures are pretty useless. He asks the class to participate and waits more than 2 minutes for someone to answer. Really heavy accent. Boring lecturer. Hard grader on reaction memos. Midterm not that reflective of the book.,0
"I had him for a senior research seminar, so I can't say much about his regular classes. He was really good about helping me with finding a direction and sources for my paper. And when I fried my computer just before the final paper was due, he was really nice about giving me an extra couple days to rewrite it. Good guy.",1
GREAT prof. brings a lot of experience. Is passionate and is interesting to listen to. You do have to do the fitness project in his class,1
"Lecture videos are worthless, but you can learn basically everything through Google. Professor is very chill and understanding though, and the course itself doesn't require much work at all. If you have even a basic understanding of Java, this class is super easy.",1
"Dr. Johansen is the epitome of a caring, and charismatic professor. She makes a Monday evening class something to look forward to. She truly demonstrates what true passion for teaching is. I am grateful and honored to have been in her class.",1
For go your self esteem before going to this class.  He will never admit that he was wrong ever. Often late. Doesn't remember what he taught and side track more than half the time. Never taught like the book and quiz you on it. The Best lecture with him was when he told us he wont be here and to attend another marketing class for the day.,0
nice,0
"I liked Dr. Feldman's humble personality and jokes, but his notes on the whiteboard were mixed up and sloppy. He threatened to grade the whole test if I wanted the point. After emailing him about Greens/Stokes/Divergence Theorems/normal vectors on last day, he said only said he discussed it in class. I never skipped class; He could have answered it",0
"Cathy is the best, and by far the best here at JMU. She is rated the best Bus160 professor on outside sources and this is no joke. Her class is always a fun time because she adds hilarious commentary to her job. Easy grader, and provides lots of extra credit opportunities. Read the textbook for exams and your solid.",1
"this professor is okay. He doesnt give much homework but for his tests you have 4 chapters to study but 10 open ended questions. His concept of a review is to ask him questions and he says yes, no, or maybe it will be on the test. In class he is not that boring and tries to help you understand what your reading. Not the greatest but not the worst.",0
It is really easy and he's is super nice. Go to class listen  and take notes. Review his study guides and you will do well.,1
This course is so badly structured. She expects you to read several standards each week.,0
Personally didnt like the course that much since it wasnt my kinda thing. however Kris is a great teacher and a nice guy overall.,1
"Easy, easy class! He doesn't do anything, but there are teacher aides that come around and help if needed. It's really easy to get ahead of the schedule because it's self-paced, but you still have to come to class for attendance points. DON'T BUY THE BOOKS! Waste of money and no need for them.",1
Dont know why she appears to be so mean on our marks: the lecture room is far from the other lecture buildings but she will always start the participation questions at the very beginning of the class? She doesn't consider if people would get injured on a slippery road when rushing from another classroom far from hers. Tends to give everyone lowmark,0
pro. jaspers is the most sweetest professor anyone could ever want. He is easy going and laid back. His lectures are very long but he allows a break in between. He gives HW every other day but the HW doesn't get checked for accuracy. He really cares about the students and if they are getting it. Take some visits to his office every now and then. ,1
Sports psych is an interesting class and she makes it as fun as possible.  Plus she is soooo funny!,1
"Yasser is not a good professor, sure if you want an easy A go take his classes, but for those of you who actually pay money to learn, take the classes from another professor.",0
"Erhan is truly a genius in worldwide economics and business, use that to your advantage. Hbest prepared to work for your grade and take perfect notes, he is tough on grading. Aside from a difficult class and his strict grading, he is energetic, upbeat, funny and an open book of knowledge. Get on good terms with him, great contact to have!",1
I loved this class and I have already signed up for several more classes with her. She was funny and always made lectures interesting though her lecture tangents were never test questions so attendance was optional. The homework is time consuming but really easy and the tests were very straight forward and in the order the material was taught.,1
"Somewhat funny. However, he changed the project criteria throughout the class and was always unclear about the requirements. You could skip class, and just read from the book or slides. Do problems somehow. He said from now on he wants make the project weigh more and use the book less. Overall he's quite inexperienced and unclear. Curves at the end",0
"She's a really nice, caring professor who wants you to do your best. Her exams are on a lot of information but if you study all the material you should be fine and she gives study guides for each exam which help a lot.",1
"He's super helpful and wants everyone to pass. If you take Gen Psych you have one paper; you critique 4 peer reviewed articles through out the semester and at the end use those for your paper. 2 tests, 1 final (not cumulative). Take notes in class and you'll pass the tests. Didn't even open the book. Takes attendance by in class refelction",1
Ridiculous with her grading. Not helpful with quetions or willing to help. Made this online class unbearable. Do not take this course online with her.,0
"Very nice lady, but not strict enough when it comes to academics. But she is very clear and willing to work with you. Her class is very boring though.",1
"DO NOT TAKE CLASS WITH HIM! Can't understand him, and makes you feel bad for asking questions. Homework takes hours and is extremely hard. I wasted money and withdrew cause I couldn't stand it anymore.",0
"This professor is awful. Her lectures vs. her homeworks/worksheets vs. her textbooks are completely off. She teaches you like she expects you to know what is already going on, and she can't be bothered with questions. The only good thing about this class is that it's a ""free class"" meaning you don't have to buy a textbook.",0
Very enthusiastic.. makes the class fun.,1
"My TA wasnt bad but sullivan hardly helped, he acted like were botany experts & should know literally everything. I didnt do too hot on the quizzes but still made an 85 for lab so if you do well on assignments & study for the quizzes itll make a difference when calculating your lab avg. An A is very achievable even tho its such a boring class.",0
"JP is a perfect example of someone who can't ""do"", so they teach instead. He is totally inept when it comes to software development and loves to tell you what the ""industry"" is doing, when it's not only completely inaccurate but it's laughable, he's never worked a day in his life in the private sector. Avoid, he's hard to understand and childish.",0
"Todd is a great professor but since he is so confident in the material he's teaching sometimes it's discouraging to sit through lectures when you don't understand the material yourself.  Three exams, four assignments and a 5 page paper - overall, would recommend taking this class with him.",1
"moves too quickly through material. does not explain how to derive the correct formula. hw is not covered in class. tests and quizzes are multiple choice. not helpful if you get stuck. quizzes are take home, but are soo challenging. not recommended if this is your 1st fin class. only take his class if no one else is available. wish i had dropped.",0
He is the best teacher at the university. He is inspirational and if you don't leave his class lecture thinking you are on top of the world then you weren't listening. He makes me go home and work hard to be successful. He cares about his students and is passionate about what he does. He is also in charge of the Engler Entrepreneurship program.,1
Fun class and very casual professor Two papers and weekly responses enjoyable class Taking him for Comp2,1
Takes a while to get used to the way he teaches. Midterm and exams are unpredictable and require a lot of work to study and succeed on. ,0
great professor! take him if you can,1
"He's an amazing professor, but the class stinks. The material is pretty dry and time-consuming with no real effort required. Despite this, Jones's determination to make class fun made it worth it. He makes up games and activities to keep the class engaged, and it makes the content much more bearable.",1
"I have to say some people are meant to teach and some are not. This ""teacher"" is not. Goes off topic a lot. She is no help in lecture, doesn't explain things well in lab, and doesn't review for test.  I would not suggest anyone to take her. If you do Good-Luck!!",0
She is very a harsh grader and rarely gives A's. However she is very nice.,0
moves over everything so quick you dont understand how she got where.,0
"I would have preferred the term challenging as opposed to ""easiness"".",1
"Don't take this professor if you can. He talks about his own education every single class, and wastes half the class period talking about things that don't relate to the subject he is supposed to be lecturing on. You are not allowed to use the bathroom, or leave class at anytime, or you will not be welcome back into the classroom.",0
"Geveci is a professor that is very knowledgeable and I respect him for that. Still, sometimes his lectures can be very confusing, but that isn't all his fault. If you want the most out of his lectures, never fall behind in the book or you will not understand Calc III. You can do it, but won't understand it. Geveci is also a very fair professor.",1
He has good slides and does a thorough job at going through them in lectures but does nothing more than that. However this course is fairly easy and if you do all the relevant problems in the textbook you're fine.,1
"Dr. RC teaches like you're a third grader, and then tests you like you have been a geo major for the past 10 years of your life. The class is really hard when it shouldn't be, and he doesn't help the matter with his boring lectures (longest 50 minutes of my life.) If you are into geography, MAYBE consider taking this class to get on his good side.",0
He is completely clueless about teaching. He is extremely difficult to understand and does not explain what he is doing or why he is doing it. He just reads what he is writing on the board without explaining anything. Avoid at all costs. You will need to seek out external resources to learn the material on your own. The free PDF textbook is awful.,0
"He is a great person, I enjoyed his classes and payed attention easily. However, his notes are very unclear and he can sometimes be hard to follow. You may need to redo your notes a couple of times to understand them.",1
I took this class online and it was an easy A. He posted a lot of lectures so there's no book needed for this class. Just have to do 5 discussion boards and a paper.,1
"Despite all the comments of praise, Dr Blake sucks. He expresses his views and if you disagree you are wrong. He makes you write trivial papers that he grades only on grammar, he doesnt even take the time to read it. Other than him being boring and not teaching the class is fine, but those 2 things make it a miserable class. Do not take him!!!",0
"Easy lectures to follow & posts the pptx on Canvas before tests. She has reading quizzes on the readings every once in a while, nothing to worry about, 3 pts and are easy if you did the reading. The tests aren't an easy A, but aren't hard either and there's extra credit at the end. I haven't tried much and I have a B+/A-, you don't know your grade",1
"Tries to be the cool professor, but fails. He fails because he relies almost entirely on PowerPoint and reads off the slides. He often gets lost in his own notes and will just talk without clicking through the slides then finish the lecture and realize clicking through all of them at the end. Ineffective, test-heavy, and unfunny. Avoid if possible.",0
entirely useless.  confused half the class on simple algebraic substitution.  scheduled his office hours during dinner and didn't show up for the final.  if you defend him then you are wasting you time at school because he has lost the will to teach.,0
"Everything terrible in a class. No pity for students, the workload is insane with 12+ hours labs EVERY week. Horrible graders that take points left and right for fun. Prof like Rashmi are the reasons rate my prof should have a 0 rating. If ya'll are stuck with her, run while you still can.",0
"She always seemed super bored in lecture and sometimes wouldn't even know what she was teaching us or how to answer a student's question. She was not good at explaining concepts and once we got past the basics, it got really confusing. The midterm had stuff we never learned and I don't think she even graded our finals.",0
"His online class was very consistent and predictable. He was easy to contact and very nice. There was a reading assignment (easy to get a 100%), a homework assignment (not the same stuff that was on the tests, really), and a quiz every week. Then just a midterm and final, which he gives you a study guide already made up. Plus a term project.",1
"Super understanding professor, very laid back with lectures and homework. You can tell he actually cares about students learning and not so much on grading. Would take him for every MKT class if I could.",1
Zhou is really kind and easy going. He can be hard to understand at first but once you get into the semester its easier to understand. go to the lectures! he basically tells you whats on the midterms in his lectures if you listen!,1
Awesome prof! He gave fill in the blank notes which made material easy and clear. Tests were pretty easy as long as you knew the terms well and read the E-reader. He made going to class exciting and interesting through his teaching style which made Eastern Religions seem more familiar for students.,1
not a cool guy,0
very wise,1
"Her lectures are somewhat interesting, but can be rather boring at times.  She is usually very disorganized and sometimes tells you something and then forgets that she told you.  She is very caring, though, and wants her students to do well.  At times she is not very clear with her feedback on your work and exactly what she expects from you.",0
"AT first he frustrated me, but after taking three of his classes I feel he made me a better economist. You may not receive an A in all his classes, but i can promise if you really care about learning economics he is the guy to take. As an advisor and a professor he is good he tells it like it is and is straight foreward.Like to learn take his class",1
"Diven is a great profesor, she gives interesting lectures and really gets to know her students. However, she is a tough grader a makes you work for it, if you are not a poli-sci or IR major and are only taking her class for an elective then be ready for a rough ride, if you are one of those majors you will quickly love her!",1
"She will write one word on the board and then stare at the class waiting for a discussion to spark. Also none of the readings will relate to this discussion so may as well skip all of those. Then the tests will be graded by her ta who isnt at discussion. The entirety of the tests are on the discussions, so you will be marked off for reciting her",0
"Great Teacher, gives extra credit. Wonderful Teacher to listen to always willing to assist students. Great Lectures",1
"Let me be extremely clear, DO NOT TAKE THIS INSTRUCTOR. He is as bad as the previous reviews state. He is not in the least bit interested in you or what you may learn. He's clearly showing-up to a job. His test are random from a database and there is no guide given. Photographic memories welcome. Work load is extremely heavy.",0
"info in class is easy, expect alot of reading, but easy grading, and he's got cute bright red floppy hair.",1
Worse teacher ever. Very good at math but shes terrible at explaining the work. Super heavy accent as well so its hard to understand her at times,0
"omg i suffered throughout this whole class. I bought all these materials for basically nothing. She tells you to buy all these colors. You only need one of each trust me. All the hw is drawing and painting which I suck at. Beba herself is a nut but she's understanding so it evens out. Overall, I did not like this class but it was a gen ed so idk",1
"Reading the Earth is a really fun COLL 150. Prof Owens does a good job keeping the material accessible to non-geology majors and in general is a really nice guy. There are a lot of papers, but none are too long. I had a good time!",1
I'm currently taking her course online and it's literally the worst online class I've ever taken. I can't keep up with the readings or the assignments. There's no explanation on most work and the modules are hard to understand. I wouldn't recommend anyone to EVER take this class.,0
He is a great teacher.  Not a single person dropped his class.  His tests are open book.  All you need to do is your homework and you have an easy A!,1
"Not the best professor at all, but extremely easy. Talks a lot and babbles but as long as you show up youll pass. Easiest grader. 2 assignments all year. Group paper and Final individual paper. Easiest class ive ever taken. Just didnt learn much.",1
"Amazing professor. Had him in foundations courses, but I really wish I could have had him for a couple advanced classes. He's remarkable, to say the least. He will definitely make you work, not just for your grade, but to help you actually improve and create something you care about. His advice is wonderful, not only in regards to drawing. 1010.",1
"talks extremely fast, and won't slow down. Lab quizzes every lab day, based on previous lab. 5 exams on top of the final. Best advice if you get her- study everything, read her lectures and slides before class. Take notes off those and not her verbal lecture. She plagiarizes all her tests so Google helps. Not an easy class by any means.",0
"Sooo hard. she clearly doesnt know how to teach, students corrected her all the time, and her tests were very hard. I even had tutoring and still failed. and she had assigned seating and in alphabetical order, what is this gradeschool? DO NOT TAKE HER, i took math 125 the next semester and got an A.",0
"Like many of the professors this year, Dr. Apelblat did not make the course suitable for online learning. All I saw were a few emails from him. The bare minimum a student should expect for Chem labs is a video on what's happening and there was only one video for the entire semester!",0
"Dr. C is an extremely intelligent musician who is very good at teaching the complexities of music through easy to understand methods. He is also very willing to meet with students for extra help. He's definitely my favorite music professor at GV. He goes quickly, so pay attention in class.",1
"Took 261 with Mike then took all his other course offerings. Lectures are very clear and easy to follow. Material is extensive but always doable. Very friendly, always helpful. Top marks.",1
"He is a worse teacher ever! His job is crunching numbers in some company, but not in college. Very mean and sarcastic teacher!",0
"Jansen is one of the best profs I have come across. He really cares about his students and takes the time to answer your questions during labs. He is amazing at breaking down concepts in social science research and makes it fun. The labs are not too hard, but you do have to watch a video each week spanning 30-50 minutes and attend lectures/labs.",1
He's a great teacher! He's very clear with what he wants from his students! He's there to help and really wants to see his students succeed. Awesome guy. ,1
GMI Joe solves differential equations harder than me and lifts weights harder than me! Overall a great class. Learned a lot.,1
"I don't think she even knows what statistics is. So scattered and cannot explain anything to save her life. Easy A if you go to the TA office hours, but don't expect her to teach you anything.",0
She really isn't the nicest lady. Pretty rude as well. Leaves class mid lecture to take phone calls for what? I don't know. There are days where she's pleasant and then days where she's so nasty you can cut the tension with a knife. If you just go to class and do your best you'll be fine. It's just not a pleasant experience though.,0
Her class is not hard at all. The problem is that her method of grading is ridiculous. For two different sections we would have to do the same thing. But the grades would be so different from each other. Her class is the online class that I ever gotten less than a B on for a discussion post.,0
"He's a very good professor, and there was a lot of useful information in the class.  There is one big group project at the end of the semester, and several individual assignments throughout.   He will help you, but you have to do some work first.  Very accomodating with schedules.",1
"I would not take any courses taught by this professor. She is hard on the grading. She is very rude to her students. Plan on spending at least 2 to 3 hours a day on her class. You will have 6 things a week to do. LearnSmart, Discussion Questions, Chapter HW, Practice Exams, And your Test all in one week every week. Let me say Exhausting!!!",0
"He lays out exactly what he wants from you. All you have to do is go to class, and do a weekly 1-2 page paper. At the end of the semester you have a 15 page paper due. Not bad at all if you keep up. You'll get an A if you go to class & put in the work",1
"I was really not looking forward to Public Speaking. I took it during the summer online and you are required to meet four times for your speeches.  At first I did not care about my grade at all and I hoped for a C, but I ended up really enjoying the class and making an A. Mrs Ferguson is great and you will learn info that you will actually use.",1
"She really means well, but she is unclear in her instructions and descriptions of things. Grading is tougher than other lab sections, but you will learn more in hers because you actually have to learn the stuff. If you put the time into the lab and ask her questions you will do fine. If she knows you care about doing well she is helpful.",1
"Scribbles vague notes on board, and cannot read handwriting whatsoever. Tests are way too hard- covers too many chapters in one exam, and are not permitted to use any notes, and entails excessive essay questions. Each individual test is worth 20% of your final grade. 70% of the final grade is based solely on these test scores.",0
"He is a really funny guy, and you can tell he loves math. However, his lectures are very confusing. Usually have to read the textbook to understand material.",0
"Dr. Hibbs is a great professor. You do need the textbook for the class and his notes are key to passing exams. Although the 20 page strategic audit may seem to be a lot, it isn't. He separates the assignment into three submissions, do your research and you'll get an easy A. He is always willing to help... STAY AWAY FROM Professor RIley!",1
"Dr. Rich is wonderful. The class is very difficult: two long papers, weekly VSpace posts, quizzes every class period, long exams, sometimes the lectures can get boring. But you do learn a good deal and she is one of the most dedicated professors at trying to get people to a good grade if you seek out help.",1
Very Sloppy! Don't take this Professor! Test are mostly easy I got a B with barely trying.,0
Don't do it. Just DON'T,0
"Heidi is extremely knowledgable and is always excited to pass her knowledge on to us. She has high expectations for class discussions, but for a good reason. While many believe art history is boring, she makes it fascinating and enjoyable",1
"Lazy and unorganized Professor. He is short with answering students and tends to tell people to just refer to their notes. Structures and grades tests in a way to benefit himself (fast marking time) - not the students. Goes through the proof of material with no real explanation - found myself asking ""where is he going with this"" in most lectures.",0
"Dr. Boni is hilarious. She tells it hows she sees it and doesn't dish out ""angel ****"" as she calls it e.g. getting world peace or ending world hunger. Lectures are kinda pointles,  interesting at times. No homework EVER except extra credit and reading the textbook. Never went to office hours, read the textbook but not the other books and got a B.",1
"Great Prof, interesting course. Wish I can have him again sometimes.",1
"I had Professor Vroman for Honors Micro Theory. I absolutely HATED the class. Her lectures are so unclear, and she goes through the material so quickly. Going to class was a waste of time. I had to teach everything to myself. Definitely do not recommend.",0
Tough prof. Slightly less evil than Barby.,0
"Benson is a hard prof. He is tough on writing and his tests are writing based. But he does help a lot, and all the answers are in his lectures and the book. He does not play tricks or games, he gives you the info and wants to see what you can do with it. Knows his stuff. I love him, have taken 4+ of his classes. You will learn a lot.I respect him.",1
I highly enjoyed Professor McKelvy's class. He is very intelligent and reading discussion always made me so excited to come to class because of the insightful things he had to say about the Bronte sisters. I loved this class and I will definitely take another class from McKelvy--he is wonderful.,1
took an online class with her and was AWFUL. she graded everything hard and the whole class was pretty much quizzes. The quizzes were hard and each question was worth 3 points so your screwed. would not take her online class again.,0
"Awesome awesome awesome guy, the nicest teacher I've ever met. Makes the class very fun and amusing. Only bad thing is class work eats alot of free time in the lab and he's picky bout picture quality. Long as you got the time to spare, he is well worth it",1
He is so adorable you will seriously want him to be your grandpa. He is so passionate about education and will inspire you so much. He is the perfect teacher for ed300 because he makes you so excited to be a teacher. His assignments were enjoyable and easy. Take him if you want to be a great teacher.,1
"Ever watch ""Scrubs?"", channel ""Dr. Cox."" Professor Brown thinks he is hilarious with his dripping sarcasm. I had rather watch TV for my entertainment and be taught for my tuition payment. His same flippant approach in his attempts to teach is what leaves students with no understanding of chemistry and their disdain for him. RUN AWAY, if assigned.",0
"thinks more of himself than he does of his students, real opinionated",0
"Margaret is the sweetest professor. You should at least skim the readings for her class if you want an A at the end, but if you attend all the lectures and do no reading you can score a high B. Discussion is incredibly easy. Always lets class out a little early, and projects are easy A's. Sit in the front row and remember the examples she mentions.",1
Not very helpful & unorganized.  Doesn't respond to emails or give clear answers to questions.,0
No homework and attendance isn't mandatory. She does an ok job at teaching the material but the tests have a bunch of weird application material that she never covers. You have to be good at math or have a previous calc background to do well in this class. She takes up time ranting about the american education system and she's hard to understand.,0
"Dr. Yang gives a lot of work and can be a tough grader, but she really is there to help you. She always responds to emails quickly and is happy to help with homework during her office hours. A lot of her class is centered around group work- she has group projects that are 20% of the grade. Also be prepared to do the entire class in RStudio.",1
"Dr.Newman is seriously THE WORST. First off, genetics has been nothing but reading outdated papers about Cystic Fibrosis. Secondly,she does NO amount of teaching. She believes that learning from peers and teaching yourself is more beneficial. Neither of which am I paying thousands of dollars for. If you can avoid having a class with her, do it.",0
She was my best professor this semester. She is really funny and helpful. Would take again!,1
Best teacher I have ever had! I learned so much from him even though I knew half of it already. He is always there for you. He understands life happens. He is hilarious. Show up the majority of the time and you will get an A.,1
"Worst math teacher I have yet to take at TMCC (and I have taken many math classes). He offers absolutely no guidance for the exams and all the 'practice' tests are worthless because they cover nothing that's on the exams. He sets his students up for failure. If you have a difficult time with math, DO NOT TAKE CASEY!",0
"Never answers e-mail, tough grade, curve down grades. The assignments are not heavy, but he expects you to do more than he assigned. The exams are awful. Extremely disorganized.",0
"Distracting antics, sure, but only in the best sense. It's all pedagogical/cognitive tricks, but they work. You WILL pay attention, and you will understand what he's trying to explain.",1
"Although I really appreciated his enthusiasm for communications his lectures moved way to fast, his tests were way to difficult, and overall I thought of him as a older frat guy. Not a huge fan.",0
I found her very hard to understand. After class I would have to reteach myself the material because I could not understand what she had taught in class. Many of my classmates and I had to get together just to try to comprehend what we were covering.,0
"Dr. P is awesome!!  She really cares about us -- when the university was going to charge us extra tuition for half hour courses, she got them to stop.",1
"She offers you extra to retry for quizzes but she not helpful if you don't understand, your midterm and final is what will make the difference in whether you pass or fail her class.  If you don't pass either midterm or final, you're more like to not pass the class.",0
Great professor! Take him.,1
"I had Cindy for Literature of the women's movement. I learned a lot in her class. It was challenging, but in a good way. Group discussions daily, and all of the readings are required. A lot of reading, a lot of writing, but it's ALL worth it. She's also one of the most helpful professors i've ever had. Take her!",1
"Forget It. I have my SEC Licenses (Series 7, 55, 63, 66) and he even confused me; Did I mention I'm a Finance Major and Financial Professional? Does not comprehend the phrase, ""Prior engagements"". His exams are verbatim his handouts. STUDY THEM/COPY THEM. The tests are still impossible but if you do not remember the handouts, good luck passing.",0
"His class is very enjoyable, interesting, and makes me want to learn about history. He's a very likable guy and is really funny. he tells the wildest stories that tie into the lesson. The exams are posted every three weeks and the reflection papers are easy if you pay attention and take notes. great guy and great class!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
wrong...just wrong,0
"I took Andys History of Rock n Roll class my freshman year back in 2013 so it should speak volumes about his personality that I still miss his lectures to this day. Witty and passionate guy who keeps it real, grading wise. Since hes been in and around the music scene he offers amazing insight on subject topics. 10/10 would recommend.",1
He is the LAZIEST professor in the COMM dept.  It's the middle of October and we have yet to receive a grade on ANY assignment.  He speads a lot of time quizzically looking at the clock and trying to figure out what to do next.  He is ill-prepared for most classes.  His handouts are poorly constructed and contain errors.  YIKES!,0
"Great person who's willing to help his students. However, unclear paper criteria and expectations until after you get your paper/test back. Possibly the most difficult paper grader in the Religion department and grades much differently than any other Professor. Content and originality aren't as important as a concise and mechanically perfect paper.",1
worst prof I've ever seen even I'm not taught by him:) cancelling a midterm less than 2 days before the actual date and plan to add all the weight to the final exam. disorganized and not standing in students' shoes - with midterm 1 that people have been complaining about the difficulty he just says it's not hard at all. a big no for sure!,0
"Doesnt respond to emails asking for help. exams are 55 mins w/ 50 questions. doesnt cover the material in the exams. I wrote 16 pages of notes for exam 2, studied for 10+ hours (bc of poor grade on exam 1) & for exam 2 I got a 37%. almost never gives out As for assignments/D.B.s. Makes me feel very stupid. Good luck.",0
Her lectures are solely talking which is very hard to follow along with. 10 online Pearson quizzes which are easy. 3 timed blackboard quizzes which are tough and mainly the going to the source book which is very hard to understand. Final is a group project story map. I would not recommend her.,0
"One of the best instructors I've ever had. He is really nice and will help you however he can. However, the effort you put in this course matters the most. It is so so so so hard to fail his class. 10/10 would take again. (Wish he had more classes I could take but I've taken them all) :(",1
"I wouldn't not recommend this class, though I wouldn't per se recommend it either. It has been the hardest class I've taken at UVa thus far. That said, I've learned a lot. He is a good lecturer and knows his stuff, and has a dry sense of humor. HIS TESTS ARE EXTREME!! I'm talking study all night and get a 65, extreme. Be wary.. All I'm saying...",1
"I have no idea why Professor Warden has such a bad rating. She's my favorite professor at this school. You have to be willing to put in the work, but she is willing to help you as much as she can. We had a quiz on most Fridays, but they were only 5 questions and super easy. I LOVED this class. I wish I could take her for all my English courses.",1
"This is the most disappointing class you can take. The assignment requirement was not clearly stated. He is a very subjective marker, and you'd better write something which can fit his political opinions. Unapproachable outside the class, he refused to talk to students in person unless you have something he thinks time-worthy.",0
"Don't take him. Not a good teacher at all. Unclear, unorganized, can't hear half of what he says. Then he seems to think it's the entire class thats the problem instead of him.",0
"Although Simons is super funny, this class is impossible to make interesting. Could not get through this class without coffee. Your grade is basically just tests and a few small projects, and there's not book. He gives a pretty spot-on study guide, but if you want to do well on the tests, you have to go to class. It isn't hard to get an A if you go",1
"Ahh, Paddy O'Cleirigh. His knowledge of ancient Greece and Rome is unparalleled - because he was there. The Classic prof, he's extremely old, but kind and reasonable. He does put you to sleep with his lectures though. Is a bit of a softy when it comes to marking.",1
"Completely useless. Rude, favors students, unfair marking and overall belittling. Lecutres have nothing to do with lab.",0
"Very well-spoken and knowledgeable. Wasn't a difficult or interesting course on its own but he made it worthwhile to attend. Understanding and flexible. If you put in the effort, show interest and communicate, can pass easily.",1
Participation is really important. Gives you homework about stuff that you haven't even learned yet. A lot of break out rooms.,0
"Terrible. two midterms worth 20% each and then a whopping 60% for the Final exam. So many grammar mistakes and question mistakes in exams, and can be very misleading, and is very hard to do well, especially with a final exam worth so much. Try your best to not take this class your very first semester, because it will drag your GPA down.",0
"Not very motived. Unavailable for help, doesn't update mistakes in his materials, expects students to put huge amounts of time into the class and doesn't really seem to put any time in himself. Unorganized. Disrespectful.",0
Tom Creahan is the worst professor at MSU. He is soft talker and you literally cannot hear his lectures. I read the chapters before the test and still scored awful. You must take a quiz repeatedly to get a decent/ at least 50% on the test. He gave me the worst grade of my life. Do not take him,0
Hesford didn't recognize that she was teaching a freshman writing class.  She expected more than we were able to give her.,1
